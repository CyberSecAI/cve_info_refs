Subject: Re: CVE-2020-28374: Linux SCSI target (LIO)
 unrestricted copy offload

Hi,

For tcmu-runner Mitre suggested that we use a different CVE as its not the same codebase.

Please use CVE-2021-3139 for tcmu-runner.

Ciao, Marcus

But it doesn't hurt anything of course.  Good catch. I'm in the process of respinning this patch and will try to clean this up at the same time.  The respin was suggested by Oracle to close the race where an XCOPY request could proceed while a lun was detached from the backstore following the ref_get(lun_ref) -> target_depend_item() -> ref_put(lun_ref) dance. ``` [Comment 37](show_bug.cgi?id=1178372#c37)  David Disseldorp   2020-12-17 00:15:54 UTC  ``` (In reply to David Disseldorp from [comment #36](show_bug.cgi?id=1178372#c36)) ... > > The only issue I saw was a nit/style point: I'm not sure I see the value of > > using the goto target "err_out" in target_xcopy_locate_se_dev_e4() when only > > one path uses it.

Actually, there are two paths to it - sess and found_dev can both be NULL on error.

But push your user branch with a different suffix than for-next, e.g. users/foo/SLE15-SP2/bsc12345 or such, then inform each branch maintainer to pull manually.  The patch prefix should be better to be cleaner without EMBARGOED (although this is no big matter in either way). ``` [Comment 48](show_bug.cgi?id=1178372#c48)  Michal Kubeček   2021-01-05 14:02:44 UTC  ``` (In reply to David Disseldorp from [comment #45](show_bug.cgi?id=1178372#c45)) > I'll submit via a user branch on kerncvs.suse.de.

Yes for SLE15-SP2 (where we have no cve/linux-5.3 yet).  For older kernels, IMHO the best approach would be to base your branches on corresponding cve/linux-* but name them in a way that makes it clear that they are not meant as pull requests for cve/linux-* (not yet, that is), e.g. .../SLE*_EMBARGO/for-next or .../cve/linux-*/1178372_EMBARGO ``` [Comment 49](show_bug.cgi?id=1178372#c49)  David Disseldorp   2021-01-05 14:23:06 UTC  ``` Thanks for the pointers Takashi and Michal.

CVE-2020-28374
==============
vulnerability
-------------
SCSI "EXTENDED COPY" (XCOPY) requests sent to a Linux SCSI target (LIO) allow an
attacker to read or write anywhere on any LIO backstore configured on the
host, provided the attacker has access to one LUN and knowledge of the victim
backstore's vpd\_unit\_serial (AKA "wwn"). This is possible regardless of the
transport/HBA settings for the victim backstore.
- in multi-tenant vhost-scsi enviroments, this can allow guests to read or write
to images assigned to other qemu processes
+ reproduced
- for iSCSI this allows CHAP, ACL and network portal isolation bypass
+ reproduced
- backstores with no corresponding transport LUN mapping remain vulnerable
+ reproduced
- all other LIO transports and backstores which allow for XCOPY processing by
LIO's target\_core\_xcopy handler should be considered vulnerable
- tcmu-runner based user backstores are also vulnerable via a similar logic bug
+ reproduced
This is due to the way that LIO behaves when processing XCOPY
copy-source/copy-destination (CSCD) descriptors; when attempting to match
CSCD descriptors with corresponding se\_devices, target\_xcopy\_locate\_se\_dev\_e4()
iterates over LIO's global devices list, which includes all configured
backstores, instead of only considering backstores which are exposed to the
initiator via transport layer ACL settings.
Similarly, when LIO is configured to forward SCSI requests to the user-space
tcmu-runner daemon (via target\_core\_user), tcmu-runner's xcopy\_locate\_udev()
iterates over all tcmu-runner devices, without considering any transport layer
restrictions.
introduced
----------
Linux Kernel (LIO target\_core\_xcopy)
- Exploitable as of
f99715ac8d6f ("target: Enable global EXTENDED\_COPY setup/release")
+ mainline v3.12-rc1 or later
- target\_xcopy\_locate\_se\_dev\_e4() bug introduced earlier via:
cbf031f425fd ("target: Add support for EXTENDED\_COPY copy offload emulation")
tcmu-runner (user-space SCSI target, coupled with LIO's target\_core\_user)
9c86bd0db97a ("tcmur: Add emulate XCOPY command support")
relevance
---------
Only affects systems with:
- Linux kernel with f99715ac8d6f, i.e. mainline v3.12-rc1 and later
- LIO SCSI target (target\_core\_mod) loaded
- at least two configured backstores
- one backstore must be exposed via a SCSI transport, e.g. iSCSI, with ACL
settings which permit access to a potential attacker
+ transport settings for other (potential victim) backstores are irrelevant
- backstores must allow and use in-kernel LIO XCOPY command emulation
+ emulate\_3pc=1 must be set on both (default)
+ "iblock", "fileio", (SLES downstream) "rbd", and "rd\_mcp" backstores
- i.e. all except special "pscsi" passthrough and "user" backstores
+ "user" backstores with tcmu-runner are also be affected, as tcmu-runner's
separate XCOPY handler uses similar logic when resolving NAA identifiers:
- should only affect backstores handled by tcmu-runner, e.g. an
XCOPY request to a "user"+tcmu-runner backstore can't be used to read or
write to an "iblock" backstore, only to other backstores handled by the
same tcmu-runner instance.
workaround
----------
Caveat: this workaround does \*not\* affect XCOPY requests sent to tcmu-runner
based backstores. It is only suitable for disabling kernel
(target\_core\_xcopy) support for XCOPY requests.
Requires acb3f2600eb8 ("target: Reject EXTENDED\_COPY when emulate\_3pc is disabled")
- v3.12-rc7 or later
XCOPY support is enabled by default, but can be disabled via:
echo 0 > /sys/kernel/config/target/core///attrib/emulate\_3pc
or
targetcli /backstores// set attribute emulate\_3pc=0
...where  and  should be filled appropriately.
exploitation
------------
The attacker sends an XCOPY request with two CSCD descriptors.
One CSCD descriptor must correspond to the NAA IEEE identifier for the LUN to
which the attacker has access. The other (victim) CSCD descriptor must be an
NAA IEEE identifier which matches another configured backstore within LIO's
global device inventory.
For successful exploitation of this bug an attacker must be able to provide a
matching NAA identifier for the victim backstore.
LIO NAA IEEE identifiers are 128 bits with a hard-coded 28-bit prefix and a
100-bit trailer derived from the backstore's configured vpd\_unit\_serial.
Neither vpd\_unit\_serial nor NAA identifiers are normally considered secret. By
default, the LIO vpd\_unit\_serial ConfigFS file mode allows any user to read it,
meaning that any local user can discover the vpd\_unit\_serial and NAA identifiers
for all backstores if the base ConfigFS mount point is reachable.
Per [target\_]xcopy\_gen\_naa\_ieee(), LIO's hard-coded NAA 28-bit prefix is
0x6001405.
100-bit trailer generation is handled by spc\_parse\_naa\_6h\_vendor\_specific(), or
xcopy\_gen\_naa\_ieee() for tcmu-runner:
- vpd\_unit\_serial is generally ASCII encoded, and set via the ConfigFS
target/core///wwn/vpd\_unit\_serial path
+ ASCII encoding doesn't appear to be checked when set via ConfigFS
- vpd\_unit\_serial to NAA identifier mapping loops over
hex\_to\_bin(vpd\_unit\_serial[i])
+ vpd\_unit\_serial bytes skipped unless [0-9],[a-f],[A-F]
+ loop ends when hex\_to\_bin() successfully converts 25 ASCII hex characters,
or the vpd\_unit\_serial nul terminator is reached.
- vpd\_unit\_serial ConfigFS changes are normally performed via targetcli, LIO's
configuration utility, but can also be done via manual ConfigFS path I/O
+ targetcli backstore creation supports an optional "wwn" parameter for
setting a backstore's vpd\_unit\_serial
+ when wwn= is not provided, targetcli (via rtslib) uses py uuid.uuid4 to
generate this
- calls return UUID(bytes=os.urandom(16), version=4)
- an attacker then needs to know / brute fource 100bits of randomness
+ an attacker can issue zero-length copy requests to quickly check for NAA
identifier validity
+ when targetcli wwn= is provided, it's fed directly into ConfigFS
vpd\_unit\_serial
- the mapped NAA identifier will end up truncated if the wwn doesn't include
at least 25 hex ASCII characters ([0-9],[a-f],[A-F])
- wwns with less than 25 hex ASCII will result in a truncated NAA identifier
Once the victim NAA identifier is known, all read and write I/O to the victim
backstore must be proxied via the backstore to which the attacking initiator has
regular READ/WRITE access.
reproducers
-----------
I/O reproducer:
- 0001-EMBARGOED-ExtendedCopy.From-ToWWNabcde-tests.patch
+ patch is based atop bc83b0ddb01aa24170c6cb54e3fab4e9a30df77d from the
libiscsi project at https://github.com/sahlberg/libiscsi.git
+ see patch header for usage instructions
Test env generators:
- vhost\_scsi\_reproducer.sh
+ deploys multi-VM vhost-scsi test environment
+ calls libiscsi test binary to demonstrate one "thief" guest reading data
from the "victim" guest's vhost-scsi attached disk
- iscsi\_reproducer.sh
+ deploys two iSCSI targets with isolated network portals and auth settings
+ demonstrates use of one iSCSI target to access backstore from other
fixes
-----
Linux Kernel fix:
- 0001-EMBARGOED-target-fix-XCOPY-NAA-identifier-lookup.patch
+ based atop mainline v5.10
tcmu-runner fix:
- 0001-EMBARGOED-tcmur-fail-cross-device-XCOPY-requests.patch
+ based atop current master (c6fda29bddf49405625c6ebd3baa6cfdccc7160a)
+ in contrast to the kernel fix, this patch completly disables cross-device
XCOPY support. This is due to the current inability of tcmu-runner to
evaluate transport layer access permissions.
CVE and embargo end date

tcmu-runner can't determine whether the device(s) referred to in XCOPY

Copy Source/Copy Destination (CSCD) descriptors should be accessible to

| JFYI, [@msmeissn](https://github.com/msmeissn) mentioned that there's a new CVE number to track this separate to the Linux kernel fix:  For tcmu-runner Mitre suggested that we use a different CVE as its not the same codebase. Please use CVE-2021-3139 for tcmu-runner. |

Subject: CVE-2020-28374: Linux SCSI target (LIO) unrestricted copy offload

===============================================================================
== Subject:     Linux SCSI target (LIO) unrestricted copy offload
==
==
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2020-28374
==
== Versions:    Linux: v3.12 and later
==              tcmu-runner: v1.3.0 and later
==
== Summary:     An attacker with access to a LUN and knowledge of Unit Serial
==              Number assignments can read and write to any LIO backstore,
==              regardless of SCSI transport settings.
===============================================================================

Description
-----------
SCSI "EXTENDED COPY" (XCOPY) requests sent to a Linux SCSI target (LIO) allow an
attacker to read or write anywhere on any LIO backstore configured on the
host, provided the attacker has access to one LUN and knowledge of the victim
backstore's vpd_unit_serial (AKA "wwn"). This is possible regardless of the
transport/HBA settings for the victim backstore.
- with vhost-scsi this can allow VM guests to read or write to images assigned
  to other qemu processes
- with iSCSI this allows CHAP, ACL and network portal isolation bypass
- backstores with no corresponding transport LUN mapping remain vulnerable
- all other LIO transports and backstores which allow for XCOPY processing by
  LIO's target_core_xcopy handler should be considered vulnerable
- tcmu-runner based user backstores are also vulnerable via a similar logic bug

This is due to the way that LIO behaves when processing XCOPY
copy-source/copy-destination (CSCD) descriptors; when attempting to match
CSCD descriptors with corresponding se_devices, target_xcopy_locate_se_dev_e4()
iterates over LIO's global devices list, which includes all configured
backstores, instead of only considering backstores which are exposed to the
initiator via transport layer ACL settings.

Similarly, when LIO is configured to forward SCSI requests to the user-space
tcmu-runner daemon (via target_core_user), tcmu-runner's xcopy_locate_udev()
iterates over all tcmu-runner devices, without considering any transport layer
restrictions.

Exploitation
------------
The attacker sends an XCOPY request with two CSCD descriptors.
One CSCD descriptor must correspond to the NAA IEEE identifier for the LUN to
which the attacker has access. The other (victim) CSCD descriptor must be an
NAA IEEE identifier which matches another configured backstore within LIO's
global device inventory.

For successful exploitation of this bug an attacker must be able to provide a
matching NAA identifier for the victim backstore.

Affected Versions
-----------------
Linux Kernel (LIO target_core_xcopy)
- Exploitable as of
  f99715ac8d6f ("target: Enable global EXTENDED_COPY setup/release")
  + mainline v3.12-rc1 and later

tcmu-runner (user-space SCSI target, coupled with LIO's target_core_user)
- Exploitable as of 9c86bd0db97a ("tcmur: Add emulate XCOPY command support")
  + tcmu-runner v1.3.0 and later

Relevance
---------
Linux kernel LIO deployments are affected under the following conditions:
- Linux kernel with f99715ac8d6f, i.e. mainline v3.12-rc1 or later
- LIO SCSI target (target_core_mod) loaded
- at least two configured backstores
- one "attacker backstore" must be exposed via a SCSI transport (e.g. iSCSI)
  which permits access to a potential attacker
  + the attacker backstore must allow and use in-kernel LIO XCOPY command
    emulation
    - all backstores except special "pscsi" passthrough and "user" types
    - emulate_3pc=1 must be set (default)
- one or more "victim backstores" must be configured
  + transport settings for victim backstores are irrelevant
  + all backstore types are vulnerable, including "iblock", "fileio", "rd_mcp",
    "pscsi" and "user"
  + emulate_3pc=1 must be set the victim backstore (default)

tcmu-runner deployments are affected under the following conditions:
- tcmu-runner with 9c86bd0db97a, i.e. v1.3.0 or later
- one "attacker backstore" must be exposed via a SCSI transport (e.g. iSCSI)
  which permits access to a potential attacker
- one or more "victim backstores" must be configured
  + transport settings for victim backstores are irrelevant
  + the victim backstore must also be managed by the same tcmu-runner instance
    - e.g. an XCOPY request to a "user"+tcmu-runner backstore can't be used to
      read or write to an "iblock" backstore, only to other backstores handled
      by the same tcmu-runner instance.

Mitigation
----------
Caveat: instructions below do *not* affect XCOPY requests sent to tcmu-runner
        based backstores. They are only suitable for disabling kernel
	(target_core_xcopy) support for XCOPY requests.

Requires acb3f2600eb8 ("target: Reject EXTENDED_COPY when emulate_3pc is disabled")
- v3.12-rc7 or later

XCOPY support is enabled by default, but can be disabled via:
  echo 0 > /sys/kernel/config/target/core/<backstore>/<name>/attrib/emulate_3pc
or
  targetcli /backstores/<backstore>/<name> set attribute emulate_3pc=0

...where <backstore> and <name> should be filled appropriately.

Fixes
-----
Linux kernel and tcmu-runner fixes will be provided following the coordinated
release date: 2021-01-12 10:00 Pacific Standard Time.
