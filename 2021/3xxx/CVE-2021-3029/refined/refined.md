Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user-supplied input within the `/showfile.php` script of a "Pacs" application. Specifically, the script uses the `exec()` function with `sudo cat` to process a file path provided by the user via the `file` parameter without sufficient sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The `/showfile.php` script allows a user to specify a file path via the `file` parameter. The application attempts to read and display this file's content. This enables an attacker to read arbitrary files on the system.
*   **OS Command Injection:** The application uses `exec('sudo cat '.$file)` to read the file. By injecting shell metacharacters (such as a semicolon `;`) into the `file` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary OS commands. Because the `www-data` user can execute `sudo` without a password, they can run commands with root privileges.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The only input validation performed is checking for the presence of spaces. However, this check can be easily bypassed with techniques like using `$IFS`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary operating system commands with root privileges on the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Data Breach:** The vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained in files accessible to the root user.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Root level access can lead to complete system compromise by malicious actors.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the `/showfile.php` endpoint with a manipulated `file` parameter to achieve the desired exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application. No authentication is required, therefore the attacker can be unauthenticated.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable `/showfile.php` endpoint and that it accepts a `file` parameter.

**Additional details from the content:**
* Affected versions include at least 6.21.5, 6.21.3 and possibly below
* The vendor was contacted but stated the versions were not supported and would not be patched
* There was an attempt to pressure the researcher after public release, which failed
* There is a separate SQL injection vulnerability in the same application
