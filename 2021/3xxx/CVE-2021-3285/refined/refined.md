  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The jxbrowser used in the Getting Started View of Code Composer Studio does not verify the validity of HTTPS connection certificates.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Weak authentication due to the lack of HTTPS certificate validation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A man-in-the-middle attack could be exploited to perform live actions, potentially allowing remote code execution by injecting malicious code via manipulated web traffic.",
  "Attack vectors": "Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack on the network connection used by Code Composer Studio.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the Code Composer Studio application and the remote server hosting the YouTube video or other resources loaded by the jxbrowser component."
