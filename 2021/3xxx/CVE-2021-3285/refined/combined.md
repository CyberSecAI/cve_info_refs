### Description

The Getting Started View in Code Composer Studio uses a browser called jxbrowser. When opened this view automatically plays a YouTube video introducing users to the product.

The way the browser was configured it did not verify the validity of https connection certificates. This weak authentication issue leaves it vulnerable to a man-in-the-middle attack which could be exploited to perform a live action.
