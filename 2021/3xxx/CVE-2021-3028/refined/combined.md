Finishes up on pull request [#27](https://github.com/git-big-picture/git-big-picture/pull/27) by rebasing onto latest `master` and by adding a simple test.

~~Sits on top of [#50](https://github.com/git-big-picture/git-big-picture/pull/50) to avoid merge conflicts for the moment.~~

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Turned it back into a draft because:  [@esc](https://github.com/esc) I just learned about `--python` from `man git-for-each-ref`. That would work with *all kinds* of quotes, even triple `'''` and `"""` because Git does the escaping for us:  ``` git for-each-ref --python --format="[%(objectname), %(*objectname), %(objecttype), %(refname)]" ```  I haven't checked yet when Git started to offer switch `--python`. What do you think about `--python`? |

Asking a question about the test, looks good otherwise!

This look convenient, but seems to be somewhat misusing the scruf testing framework since it's not strictly testing features of the command line interface. But, this is probably a lot harder/laborious to do in "regular" python test code with `unitest` and friends?

It's mostly a crash test for now, true, yes. We can make a deal about re-writing it outside of scruf after 1.0.0 if you like.
