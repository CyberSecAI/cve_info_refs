Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3711:

**Content from security.netapp.com_8dacd5ab_20250114_182353.html:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A bug in the implementation of SM2 decryption code in OpenSSL causes the calculation of the required buffer size to be smaller than the actual size needed during the second `EVP_PKEY_decrypt()` call.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow vulnerability in OpenSSL's SM2 decryption implementation.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  A buffer overflow of up to 62 bytes, potentially leading to altered application behavior or crashes (DoS). The overflow can alter data held after the buffer.
*   **Attack vectors:** A malicious attacker presents SM2 content for decryption to an application utilizing OpenSSL.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide SM2 encrypted data to be decrypted by a vulnerable application.

**Content from www.oracle.com_f2d78ea9_20250114_182403.html:**

* This content discusses Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory and does not directly describe the vulnerability. However, it does mention that CVE-2021-3711 is a vulnerability included in that patch update. The risk matrices detail specific impact on their products and versions

**Content from www.tenable.com_8f2de596_20250115_112320.html:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The buffer size calculation of the SM2 decryption routine is incorrect, leading to a potential overflow in the buffer that's allocated.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow in the SM2 decryption within OpenSSL
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to attacker-chosen data overflowing the buffer by up to 62 bytes, causing changes in data located after the buffer (potentially leading to application crashes or changes in its behavior).
*   **Attack vectors:** A malicious attacker who presents SM2 content for decryption to an application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply malicious SM2 content that will be decrypted by a vulnerable application.

**Content from www.openwall.com_d9ba3e39_20250114_182348.html:**

*  **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect buffer size calculation during SM2 decryption in OpenSSL, specifically when calling the `EVP_PKEY_decrypt` function twice. The first call is to determine buffer size, and the second is to decrypt the data using the now allocated buffer, which could be smaller than required.
*  **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow when calling EVP_PKEY_decrypt function for SM2 decryption
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Attacker chosen data overflows a buffer (up to 62 bytes), altering data after the buffer, potentially leading to crashes or changes in application behavior.
*   **Attack vectors:** A malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to supply crafted SM2 content that will be decrypted by a vulnerable application.

**Content from www.debian.org_4717b5d5_20250114_182357.html:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Buffer overflow when decrypting SM2 content.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper buffer size calculation during SM2 decryption in OpenSSL
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  Can lead to altered application behavior or application crashes (DoS).
*   **Attack vectors:**  An attacker able to present SM2 content for decryption.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker has to be able to present SM2 content for decryption.

**Content from www.openssl.org_2b900160_20250114_182359.html:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:**  A flaw in the buffer size calculation of the SM2 decryption routine in OpenSSL's `EVP_PKEY_decrypt` function when called for a second time with allocated buffer
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow due to incorrect calculation in SM2 decryption code
*   **Impact of exploitation:**  A malicious attacker can cause a buffer overflow by up to 62 bytes, altering data located after the buffer, potentially leading to application crashes or changes in behavior.
*   **Attack vectors:** A malicious attacker who is able to present SM2 content for decryption to a vulnerable application.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to present SM2 content that will be decrypted by the vulnerable application.

**Content from security.gentoo.org_6d7f2f38_20250114_182352.html:**

*  This content lists CVE-2021-3711 as a vulnerability in a third party library used by IBM Spectrum Protect, but does not contain vulnerability specifics.

**Content from www.tenable.com_0f0efd9f_20250114_182411.html**
*  This content mentions CVE-2021-3711 as a vulnerability resolved in the patch of Nessus Network Monitor 6.0.0, but does not contain specifics.

**Content from security.netapp.com_26a710e1_20250114_182355.html:**
* This content lists CVE-2021-3711 as a vulnerability included in the IBM Cognos Analytics vulnerabilities, and refers to Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory for specifics.

**Summary of CVE-2021-3711:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the OpenSSL SM2 decryption implementation, specifically the incorrect calculation of buffer sizes when the `EVP_PKEY_decrypt()` function is called multiple times.
*   **Weakness:** This leads to a buffer overflow due to the buffer allocated with a first call not being big enough for subsequent calls.
*   **Impact:** Attackers may trigger a buffer overflow of up to 62 bytes, potentially leading to:
    *   Application crashes (Denial of Service).
    *   Alteration of adjacent memory regions, possibly changing application behavior.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The attacker must supply specifically crafted SM2 encrypted data that will be processed (decrypted) by a vulnerable application using OpenSSL.
*   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to present SM2 content to be decrypted by a vulnerable application.
*   **Affected Versions:** OpenSSL versions 1.1.1k and earlier.

**Additional Notes:** The vulnerability affects server-side applications, due to the need to process user-supplied data.
