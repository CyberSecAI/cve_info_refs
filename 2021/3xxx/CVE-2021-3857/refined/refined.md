Based on the provided content, this commit addresses multiple potential XSS (Cross-Site Scripting) vulnerabilities by implementing HTML sanitization. Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application was vulnerable to XSS attacks due to the improper handling of user-controlled data when rendering HTML content. Specifically, it was directly embedding user-provided strings into HTML elements using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` without prior sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The primary vulnerability is the potential for XSS. Attackers could inject malicious JavaScript code through user-controlled input fields (e.g., application names, segment names, message content, labels, etc.). This would then be executed within the browsers of other users when the unsanitized data was rendered.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of these XSS vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal session cookies or authentication tokens.
    - Deface the web application.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Potentially gain further access to the application or server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into fields where user input is used to generate the HTML content using `dangerouslySetInnerHTML`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to inject or modify user input that's later displayed in the application without sanitization. This could be through:
    - Having a privileged account in the application that allows modifications to specific fields.
    - Being able to manipulate user data if it comes from an external source before it is rendered by the application.

**Mitigation:**
- The commit mitigates these vulnerabilities by using the `escapeHTML` function from the `@chaskiq/components/src/utils/htmlSanitize` module. This function converts special characters (e.g., `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`) into their corresponding HTML entities, preventing the browser from interpreting the injected script.

**Specific changes:**
The commit modifies the following files to include HTML sanitization using `escapeHTML` to ensure the proper rendering of data provided by users or other external sources:
- `app/graphql/mutations/app_users/update_app_user.rb`: Minor change, but likely related to the overall security improvements.
- `app/javascript/packages/components/src/components/segmentManager/index.tsx`: Sanitizes segment names in the "Save Segment" modal.
- `app/javascript/packages/messenger/src/client_messenger/consentView.tsx`: Sanitizes the application name in the GDPR consent view.
- `app/javascript/packages/messenger/src/client_messenger/conversations/appPackageBlock.tsx`: Sanitizes item labels displayed within application packages.
- `app/javascript/src/layout/sidebar.tsx`: Sanitizes the application name in the sidebar greeting.
- `app/javascript/src/pages/Dashboard.tsx`: Sanitizes the application name in the dashboard header.
- `app/javascript/src/pages/Profile.tsx`: Sanitizes message content in the profile page.
- `app/javascript/src/pages/campaigns/editor.tsx`:  (Unclear from this diff, but likely related to sanitization, or removal of unsafe rendering of campaign data)
- `SECURITY.md`: Added a way to contact the developer for security disclosures.

In summary, this commit addresses potential XSS vulnerabilities by adding sanitization to multiple parts of the application where user input could be reflected in the HTML output.
