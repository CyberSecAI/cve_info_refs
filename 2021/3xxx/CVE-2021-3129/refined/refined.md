      "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The vulnerability is due to insecure usage of `file_get_contents()` and `file_put_contents()` in the `MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution.php` class of the Ignition package when debug mode is enabled in Laravel applications. This class is intended to modify Blade template files by making a variable optional, but it does not properly validate the `viewFile` parameter.",

          "Unvalidated input leading to arbitrary file read/write.",
          "Use of stream wrappers, specifically php://filter, to manipulate file contents.",
          "Lack of checks to ensure the provided path is a legitimate blade template file."

            "HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint provided by the Ignition package.",
            "Manipulating the `viewFile` parameter to specify arbitrary files and use `php://filter` stream wrappers to achieve code execution by modifying the Laravel log file or sending arbitrary packets to PHP-FPM via FTP."
