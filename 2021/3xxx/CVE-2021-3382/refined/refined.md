The provided content relates to CVE-2021-3382.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The incorrect use of `filepath` instead of `path` in the routers/editor component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The use of `filepath` instead of `path` leads to a potential stack overflow vulnerability on Windows systems.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A stack overflow can crash the application or potentially lead to other more severe impacts if other vulnerabilities are present in the program.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability exists in the way file paths are handled within the routers/editor component of the Gitea application. The specific way to trigger the stack overflow by manipulating the file path is not detailed in this content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker would likely need to have the ability to send requests to the Gitea server that include specific path parameters that exploit the vulnerable code. The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted path to the vulnerable code.
