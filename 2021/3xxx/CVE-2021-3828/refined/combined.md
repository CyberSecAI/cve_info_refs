|  |  | Ideally, the execution time of such a regular expression is linear |
|  |  | in the length of the input. As such, we would expect exec\_times["long"] |
|  |  | to be roughly 10 times as big as exec\_times["short"]. |
|  |  | With the ReDoS in place, it took roughly 80 times as long. |
|  |  | For now, we accept values below 30 (times as long), due to the potential |
|  |  | for variance. This ensures that the ReDoS has certainly been reduced, |
|  |  | if not removed. |
