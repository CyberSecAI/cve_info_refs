Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-3645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Prototype Pollution issue within the `merge` function.  This occurs when the function recursively merges objects, without sanitizing the keys. An attacker can inject properties like `__proto__` or `constructor` which are then used to modify the prototype of the base object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The core weakness is the lack of input validation for keys during the merging process. Specifically, keys such as `__proto__` and `constructor` were not being handled properly.  This allows an attacker to potentially inject properties into the base object's prototype.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Property Modification:** By manipulating the object's prototype, attackers can potentially modify the behavior of other objects of the same type, leading to denial-of-service, information disclosure, or even remote code execution in vulnerable environments, although RCE would require a more complicated scenario in this context. In this simple function, an attacker could for example set `{}.polluted` to true.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker provides a crafted input object to the `merge` function, which contains `__proto__` or `constructor` as keys.  When the merge operation is performed, these properties are used to modify the prototype of the target object instead of the object itself.
- The `test/test.js` has added a new test case to simulate the attack: `var prototype_pollution_test = JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":true}}')`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the source objects that are passed as input to the `merge` function.
- The attacker is assumed to be able to craft JSON objects with malicious property names such as `__proto__` and `constructor`.
- No special privilege is needed in this case, just to supply crafted input to `merge` function.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided code fixes the vulnerability by adding a check `if (key === "__proto__" || key === "constructor") continue;` which prevents the `merge` function from processing those special properties.
