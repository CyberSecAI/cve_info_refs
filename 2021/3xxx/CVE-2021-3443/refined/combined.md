| Note that this closely related to / the same issue as [#265](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/265). That issue was closed as resolved via the patch for [#264](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/264), but it apparently only resolved the problem by making it unreachable with the specific test file.  As previously mentioned in [#265](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/265), the crash was first reproducible in version 2.0.20, specifically as of commit [a4dc77c](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/a4dc77cca1163347d0aa677d56da332c3f119021). The relationship of that commit to this crash wasn't obvious to me, so here's what I found investigating it further.  The relevant part of the [a4dc77c](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/a4dc77cca1163347d0aa677d56da332c3f119021) is the `depth` check added to `jas_image_cmpt_create()` - both test images, here and in [#265](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/265), fail the check because of both `depth` and `sgnd` being 1. Due to that, `jas_image_cmpt_create()` returns NULL to its caller `jas_image_addcmpt()`, which immediately reports error with -1 return value:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.27/src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c#L858-L863>  This error condition is handled in `jas_image_depalettize()` and causes error to be returned by that function as well:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.27/src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c#L1043-L1045>  However, the error return from `jas_image_depalettize()` is not handled in `jp2_decode()`:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.27/src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c#L389-L393>  In that code, `dec->chantocmptlut[channo]` is set to refer to component that wasn't created, resulting in an attempt to use an uninitialized memory here:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.26/src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c#L454-L455>  The fix in [f94e749](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/f94e7499a8b1471a4905c4f9c9e12e60fe88264b) should guard against uninitialized memory use at that spot, but I wonder if this should be / have been fixed via proper check if `jas_image_depalettize()` failed.  I actually see that [#268](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/268) / [c4144a6](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/c4144a6fdb2660794136d1daaa80682ee40b138b) had the same cause, it was only triggering the uninitialized memory use at a different place:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.25/src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c#L438-L439> |

| Note that I do not consider [a4dc77c](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/a4dc77cca1163347d0aa677d56da332c3f119021) commit to introduce the issue or 2.0.20 be the first affected version. There were other reasons why `jas_image_cmpt_create()` could return error prior to that commit. However, is seems that the reproducers triggering the `depth` check failures are easier to create via fuzzing. |

| [@thoger](https://github.com/thoger) I hope that I understood your comments correctly. I agree with your assessment that the return type of the depalettizing function should be checked and also there is a null pointer dereference at least in some cases. This should be fixed now in commit [717aeda](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/717aeda40883b91f51161ea6c5dcac5f50ef7a59). Can you please confirm that I did understand your comments correctly and things seem okay now on your side? Thanks. |

| Note that this closely related to / the same issue as [#265](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/265). That issue was closed as resolved via the patch for [#264](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/264), but it apparently only resolved the problem by making it unreachable with the specific test file.  As previously mentioned in [#265](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/265), the crash was first reproducible in version 2.0.20, specifically as of commit [a4dc77c](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/a4dc77cca1163347d0aa677d56da332c3f119021). The relationship of that commit to this crash wasn't obvious to me, so here's what I found investigating it further.  The relevant part of the [a4dc77c](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/a4dc77cca1163347d0aa677d56da332c3f119021) is the `depth` check added to `jas_image_cmpt_create()` - both test images, here and in [#265](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/265), fail the check because of both `depth` and `sgnd` being 1. Due to that, `jas_image_cmpt_create()` returns NULL to its caller `jas_image_addcmpt()`, which immediately reports error with -1 return value:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.27/src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c#L858-L863>  This error condition is handled in `jas_image_depalettize()` and causes error to be returned by that function as well:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.27/src/libjasper/base/jas_image.c#L1043-L1045>  However, the error return from `jas_image_depalettize()` is not handled in `jp2_decode()`:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.27/src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c#L389-L393>  In that code, `dec->chantocmptlut[channo]` is set to refer to component that wasn't created, resulting in an attempt to use an uninitialized memory here:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.26/src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c#L454-L455>  The fix in [f94e749](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/f94e7499a8b1471a4905c4f9c9e12e60fe88264b) should guard against uninitialized memory use at that spot, but I wonder if this should be / have been fixed via proper check if `jas_image_depalettize()` failed.  I actually see that [#268](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/268) / [c4144a6](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/c4144a6fdb2660794136d1daaa80682ee40b138b) had the same cause, it was only triggering the uninitialized memory use at a different place:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/blob/version-2.0.25/src/libjasper/jp2/jp2_dec.c#L438-L439> |

| Note that I do not consider [a4dc77c](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/a4dc77cca1163347d0aa677d56da332c3f119021) commit to introduce the issue or 2.0.20 be the first affected version. There were other reasons why `jas_image_cmpt_create()` could return error prior to that commit. However, is seems that the reproducers triggering the `depth` check failures are easier to create via fuzzing. |

| [@thoger](https://github.com/thoger) I hope that I understood your comments correctly. I agree with your assessment that the return type of the depalettizing function should be checked and also there is a null pointer dereference at least in some cases. This should be fixed now in commit [717aeda](https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/717aeda40883b91f51161ea6c5dcac5f50ef7a59). Can you please confirm that I did understand your comments correctly and things seem okay now on your side? Thanks. |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1939233#c0)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-03-15 19:13:15 UTC  ``` A flaw was found in jasper before 2.0.26. A NULL pointer dereference in jp2_decode in jp2_dec.c may lead to program crash and denial of service.  Reference: <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/269>  Upstream patch: <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/commit/f94e7499a8b1471a4905c4f9c9e12e60fe88264b>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1939233#c1)  Guilherme de Almeida Suckevicz    2021-03-15 19:27:08 UTC  ``` Created jasper tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1939240](show_bug.cgi?id=1939240 "CLOSED ERRATA - CVE-2021-3443 jasper: NULL pointer dereference in jp2_decode in jp2_dec.c [fedora-all]")]   Created mingw-jasper tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1939241](show_bug.cgi?id=1939241 "CLOSED NOTABUG - CVE-2021-3443 mingw-jasper: jasper: NULL pointer dereference in jp2_decode() in jp2_dec.c [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1939233#c4)  Tomas Hoger    2021-03-22 21:12:18 UTC  ``` In reply to [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=1939233#c0): > A flaw was found in jasper before 2.0.26.  The "before" here is incorrect - it was reported in 2.0.26, and fixed in 2.0.27.   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1939233#c6)  Tomas Hoger    2021-03-23 16:30:25 UTC  ``` Note that the fist Jasper version that crashes with the reproducer included in the upstream bug report is 2.0.20.  However, the problem exists in earlier versions as well.  More detailed analysis can be found in the upstream issue:  <https://github.com/jasper-software/jasper/issues/269#issuecomment-804423097>   ``` |  |
