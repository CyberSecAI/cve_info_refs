Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a time-based blind SQL injection in the `id_product` parameter of the Prestashop e-commerce platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `id_product` parameter, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*  **Blind SQL Injection:** The application's response does not directly reveal database errors, which requires the use of techniques like time-based attacks to infer information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Exfiltration:** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the database. Although the provided example uses SLEEP() to demonstrate a time-based blind SQLi, other payloads could be used to extract data.
*   **Data Modification:** It's possible that the SQL injection could be used to modify or delete data in the database. This is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided content.
*   **System Takeover (potential):** While the provided exploit demonstrates a blind SQLi, an advanced attacker with more sophisticated payloads could potentially escalate privileges and gain access to system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through an HTTP GET request targeting a specific URL. The vulnerable parameter is `id_products[]`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQLi:** The attacker needs to know how to craft time-based SQL injection payloads.
*   **No Authentication Required (implied):** Based on the exploit provided, no authentication appears to be required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Target Version:** The specific version of Prestashop that is vulnerable to attack is version 1.7.7.0

**Additional Information:**
*   The exploit utilizes the `SLEEP()` function in MySQL to cause a delay, which allows the attacker to confirm if the injected SQL query was executed.
*   Mitigation techniques are mentioned which include:
    *   Use of prepared statements
    *   Use of stored procedures
    *   Use of whitelisting for allowed characters
    *   Giving least privilege to application database user
