Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-3346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of the "next" parameter in the foris login page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the page via this parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where user-supplied input is not validated or sanitized, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** Attackers can use the XSS vulnerability to redirect the login credentials to a malicious server.
- **Arbitrary Actions:** As stated by the reporter, with XSS, there is a possibility for broader malicious actions beyond just credential theft. This can include actions like session hijacking, defacement, or data exfiltration from the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **URL Parameter Injection:** The attack vector is through the "next" URL parameter of the login page. The attacker crafts a URL containing malicious JavaScript code within the "next" parameter and tricks the user into clicking on it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a user into visiting the crafted malicious URL. This can be done through phishing emails, malicious links on websites, or other similar means.
- **Basic Knowledge of HTML/JavaScript:** The attacker must have a basic understanding of HTML and JavaScript to craft the malicious script.
