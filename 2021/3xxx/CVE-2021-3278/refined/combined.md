**Project: Local Service Search Engine Management System using PHP/MySQLi**

## **About**

The **Local Service Search Engine Management System** is a simple PHP/MySQLi project that can help local Freelancers workers, Companies, or small business that provides services. This system store the details and information of the on-call workers or Freelancers and Companies so when the people or company needed service for any type of services they needs can simply search from the website that is available or can give service in their area. The system is a simple project that provides people or other company needs a service or to do work for them temporarily, this system can also help freelancers or small business to market their skills by making their information more attractive to the persons or companies who are looking a temporary worker with a certain skill. The system has 2 sides of User Interface which are the Administrator Side and the User Side. The Administrator Side is the side of the system that manages the data or information for the website and the User Side is the system side that serves as the website which displays all the data of the system for the website visitors.

## Features

### Admin Side

* **Login Page**
  + The page where the admin user submits their system credentials to access the admin side of the system.
* **Home Page**
  + The page where the admin user is being redirected by default after logging into the system.

  + The page where the admin user creates a new service category and manages the list.
* **Areas Page**
  + The page where local areas are listed and managed.
* **New Person/Company Page**
  + The page where the admin user adds a new Freelance or Company/Small Businesses along with their contact information and service description they/he/she can provide to their possible clients.
* **Persons/Companies List Page**
  + The page where all the Freelancers, Company, and Small Businesses that stored in the system are listed and navigate to **edit, view, and delete.**
* **Settings About Page**
  + The page where the **"About Page Content"** is being managed.
* **System Settings Page**
  + The page where the admin manages the w**ebsite name, cover photo, address, and contact details**.

### Users Side

The Local Service Search Engine Management System was developed using HTML, PHP/MySQLi, CSS, JavaScript (jQuery/Ajax), and Bootstrap for the design. The source code is fully functional and easy to modify or enhance. Follow the instruction below to have an actual experience using this simple project.

## How to Run

1. Download the source code and extract the zip file.
2. Download or set up any local web server that runs **PHP** script.
3. Open the web-server database and create a new database name it **lssems\_db**.
4. Import the SQL file located in the **database** folder of the source code.
5. Copy and paste the source code to the location where your local web server accessing your local projects. Example for **XAMPP('C:\xampp\htdocs')**
6. Open a web browser and browse the project. E.g [**http://localhost/lssems**] for the user's side and [**http://localhost/lssems/admin**] for the admin side.

## Default Admin Access

**Username: admin

Password: admin123**

I hope this simple Local Service Search Engine Management System will help you with what you are looking for, feel free to download and modify the source code.

Note: Due to the size or complexity of this submission, the author has submitted it as a .zip file to shorten your download time. After downloading it, you will need a program like Winzip to decompress it.

Virus note: All files are scanned once-a-day by SourceCodester.com for viruses, but new viruses come out every day, so no prevention program can catch 100% of them.

FOR YOUR OWN SAFETY, PLEASE:

1. Re-scan downloaded files using your personal virus checker before using it.

2. NEVER, EVER run compiled files (.exe's, .ocx's, .dll's etc.)--only run source code.

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
