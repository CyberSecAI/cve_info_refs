## Description

![@pupiles](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/30405721?u=7dbda67aec526bc73e08d73f15a44739645d17f4&v=4&size=48)[pupiles](https://github.com/pupiles)opened [on Oct 29, 2021](https://github.com/github/securitylab/issues/464#issue-1039282878)
## Query

Relevant PR: [github/codeql-go#596](https://github.com/github/codeql-go/pull/596)

## Report

Constructing LDAP names or search filters directly from tainted data enables attackers to inject specially crafted values that changes the initial meaning of the name or filter itself. Successful LDAP injections attacks can read, modify or delete sensitive information from the directory service.

This query identifies cases in which a LDAP query executes user-provided input without being sanitized before.

* Are you planning to discuss this vulnerability submission publicly? (Blog Post, social networks, etc). *We would love to have you spread the word about the good work you are doing*

## Result(s)

*Provide at least one useful result found by your query, on some revision of a real project.*

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
