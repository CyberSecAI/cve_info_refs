Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41232:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the construction of LDAP (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol) search filters using user-provided input without proper sanitization. Specifically, the application directly incorporates the username into the LDAP filter string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **LDAP Injection (CWE-90):** The core vulnerability is LDAP injection. By injecting specially crafted input into the username field, an attacker can manipulate the LDAP query, changing its intended meaning.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
- Reading sensitive information from the directory service.
- Modifying data within the directory service.
- Deleting sensitive information from the directory service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the username field during the authentication process when LDAP is used for authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide input to the username field during the authentication process.
- The target instance needs to have LDAP authentication enabled.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.16.3 of `thunderdome-planning-poker`.
- The fix implemented LDAP escaping on the username input before it's used in the filter query, mitigating the injection vulnerability.
- The affected code is in `auth.go`, where the LDAP search request is constructed.
- The vulnerability is classified as high severity with a CVSS v3 score of 8.1.
- The GitHub Security Advisory for this issue is GHSA-26cm-qrc6-mfgj.
- The vulnerability was found by a query that identifies cases where a LDAP query executes user-provided input without sanitization.
