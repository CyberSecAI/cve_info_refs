Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) flaw in the Rundeck webhook functionality. The application failed to properly authorize access to webhook definitions, allowing a user with read access in one project to potentially access webhook details (including tokens) in another project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The application was using a direct reference (the webhook ID) without proper authorization checks to ensure the user had permissions to access webhooks in the specified project.
*   **Insufficient Authorization:**  The application lacked the necessary authorization checks to verify if an authenticated user, who is authorized to read webhooks in one project, is also authorized to read webhook details from other projects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with read access to webhooks in one project could retrieve webhook definitions and tokens from other projects where they are not authorized.
*   **Unauthorized Webhook Triggering:**  The exposed webhook tokens could then be used by the attacker to trigger those webhooks, potentially initiating unauthorized actions.
*   **Severity:** The severity is considered "Moderate" and depends on the trust level of authenticated users and the sensitivity of actions triggered by the webhooks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** An attacker could craft a request to the webhook endpoint, manipulating the `id` and `project` parameters to target webhooks in unauthorized projects.
*   **Authenticated User Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within the Rundeck platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have an authenticated account on the Rundeck platform.
*   The attacker must have authorization to read webhooks within at least one project.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix was introduced in Rundeck versions 3.4.5 and 3.3.15.
*   The commit `a3bdc06a0731da902593732022a5b9d2b4facec5` shows the code changes that address the vulnerability by introducing the `getWebhookForProjectWithAuth` method and enforcing authorization checks using the `WebhookService` and `AuthContextEvaluator`.
*   The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).
