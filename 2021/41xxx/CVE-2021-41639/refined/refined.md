Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities found in the MELAG FTP Server:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause lies in multiple insecure coding practices within the MELAG FTP Server application, including:

*   Lack of proper input validation and sanitization
*   Missing authentication checks
*   Use of default or insecure configurations
*   Storage of sensitive information in plain text
*   Running the server with high privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **User Enumeration:** The server responds differently to valid and invalid usernames during the `USER` command, allowing an attacker to enumerate valid users.
2.  **Authentication Bypass:** After a valid username is provided using the `USER` command, many FTP commands, including `LIST` and `RETR` can be executed without requiring a password using a manual approach. This is because the `RefUserAccount` is set after a valid username is given and subsequent commands rely on this attribute without verifying the password.
3.  **Path Traversal:** The `CWD` command does not validate the provided path allowing an attacker to navigate outside of the user's home directory and access arbitrary files on the host system.
4.  **Storage of Cleartext Passwords:** User passwords are stored in plain text within the `config.dat` XML file located under `%ProgramData%\\ProgramData\\MELAG Medizintechnik GmbH & Co. KG\\FTP-Server\\config.dat`.
5.  **Weak File Permissions:** The `config.dat` file has default permissions that allow "Everyone" full control, enabling a local attacker to gain access to the stored FTP user credentials.
6.  **High System Privileges:** The FTP server can be installed as a Windows service running as the `NT Authority\SYSTEM` user, granting it the highest system privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, such as user credentials, configuration files, and arbitrary files on the host system.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** By chaining multiple vulnerabilities an unauthenticated attacker can gain full system privileges by using path traversal, cleartext passwords and leveraging the server running as SYSTEM.
*   **System Compromise:** A compromised server can lead to the compromise of the entire host system.
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can access and exfiltrate sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** Exploitation can be done remotely from the network, even over the internet, if the FTP server is publicly exposed.
*   **Local Access:** A local attacker with access to the system running the FTP server can exploit the weak file permissions to compromise all FTP users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target FTP server.
*   **No Authentication:** The initial stages of the attack do not require any valid credentials.
*   **Manual Approach Required**: Due to how most FTP client implementations work, a custom approach to interact with the server is needed to bypass authentication.
*   **Knowledge of FTP Protocol:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of the FTP protocol to exploit the vulnerabilities.
*   **Optional local access**: To leverage weak file permissions an attacker must have local access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor was unresponsive to multiple attempts at responsible disclosure.
*   The identified vulnerabilities are in version 2.2.0.4 of the MELAG FTP Server.
*   The vulnerabilities can be chained for complete system compromise.
*   The vendor did not provide any patches at the time the blog post was written.
*   The blog suggests disconnecting the vulnerable FTP server from untrusted networks (especially the internet) as the only available mitigation.
