Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41239:

**Summary:** The vulnerability lies in the User Status API of Nextcloud, where it does not properly respect the user enumeration settings configured by the administrator. This allows a user to potentially enumerate other users on the instance, even when such listings are intended to be disabled.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The user status API was not checking the `shareapi_allow_share_dialog_user_enumeration` and `shareapi_restrict_user_enumeration_to_group` settings, leading to the leakage of user information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **User Enumeration:** The core vulnerability is that the API reveals user information that should be restricted based on administrator settings.
- **Privacy Violation**: The user status API reveals user information which can be privacy concern where user listing is disabled in general.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker (or a regular user) can enumerate other users on the Nextcloud instance, gaining knowledge of usernames, which would otherwise be restricted. This can be a privacy concern and a stepping stone for other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by querying the User Status API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be a valid user of the Nextcloud instance.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue involves ensuring the user status API checks `shareapi_allow_share_dialog_user_enumeration` and `shareapi_restrict_user_enumeration_to_group` settings and returning an empty list if these settings indicate that user enumeration should be restricted.
