Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a CSV Injection issue found in the Ericsson ECM (Enterprise Content Management) solution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The "Security Provider" endpoint within the "User Profile Management" section is vulnerable to CSV injection.
- The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "Configuration Name" field when creating or editing a security provider.
- Maliciously crafted formulas can be injected into the "Configuration Name" field. When a report is generated in CSV format, the injected formulas are executed when the file is opened in spreadsheet software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Hijacking the user's computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software.
    - Exfiltration of contents from the spreadsheet or other open spreadsheets.
    - Execution of arbitrary code through spreadsheet formulas (e.g., calculator pop-up used in the PoC)
- This can lead to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to be a normal user of the ECM.
- The attack is performed by injecting a malicious formula into the "Configuration Name" field of a security provider.
- The malicious payload is triggered when another user extracts and opens the security provider report in CSV format.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- A normal user account on the Ericsson ECM is sufficient to perform the attack.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerable version is **Ericsson ECM (Enterprise Content Management) solution Version: 18.0 (0331) R1E**.
*   The vulnerability has been reported to Ericsson and fixed in later versions after 18.0.
*   The Proof of Concept (PoC) involves injecting a formula that pops up the calculator to demonstrate arbitrary code execution.
