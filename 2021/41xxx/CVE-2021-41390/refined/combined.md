Dear Reader,

I was able to identify **CSV Injection** in **Ericsson ECM (Enterprise Content Management) solution Version: 18.0 (0331) R1E**

**CVE ID:  CVE-2021-41390**

Below are its details:

**# Software description:**

Ericsson Catalog Manager allows customers to rapidly launch and enable new innovative offerings with simple user experience and enterprise product, service & resource catalog capabilities.

**# Technical Details & Impact:**

It was observed that **Security Provider** Endpoint in **User Profile Management** Section is vulnerable to **CSV Injection**, using CSV injection; Maliciously crafted formulas can be used for three key attacks:

* Hijacking the user's computer by exploiting vulnerabilities in the spreadsheet software, such as CVE-2014-3524.
* Hijacking the user's computer by exploiting the user's tendency to ignore security warnings in spreadsheets that they downloaded from their own website.
* Exfiltrating contents from the spreadsheet, or other open spreadsheets.

**# POC**

1. Login as normal user in ECM
2. Click on **User Profile Management** and click on **Security Provider.**
3. Edit or create new **Security Provider.**
4. In **Configuration Name** field write your Malicious formula, for test-case we used the formula to popup calculator on user machine.
5. Click on Save button.
6. Any user who extract the Security Provider report in CSV format, upon opening the report the payload will be executed as shown in below screenshots

Dear Reader, I was able to identify stored XSS in multiple web base modules of Ericsson BSCS iX R18 Billing & Rating platform  Below are its details: # Software description: Ericsson Billing is a convergent billing solution for telecoms that combines an unrivaled combination of out-of-the box features and high configurability. As an evolution of the widely-installed Ericsson BSCS iX, Ericsson Billing provides a low-risk but effective route to capture and secure revenue streams and take advantage of business opportunities from both traditional telecom services as well as digital services, 5G and IoT. # Technical Details & Impact: There are multiple web base modules in BSCS iX e.g. ADMX, MX (monitoring center), CX etc. It was observed that ADMX and MX are vulnerable to stored XSS, In most test cases session hijacking was also possible by utilizing the XSS vulnerability. This potentially allows for full account takeover, or exploiting admin's browsers using beef...

  Enjay CRM is a collection which contains the CRM software along with Linux Ubuntu, however normal user don't have access to the underlying OS. Once the OS boots its runs the Enjay CRM software which has multiple read-only options.  However some of these options opens a terminal to perform a specific activity, This terminal is unrestricted and user can access the underlying OS as a ROOT and can run any command on OS. Underlying OS can be accessed using two methods; Also CVEs are assigned to these findings. 1. Using Ping menu (CVE-2024-41308):  it will open a terminal and user can click on File menu -> New Tab/New window. And root level terminal will be open. 2.
