{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `PyArray_DescrNew` function in NumPy lacks proper validation of its return value. This can lead to a scenario where an invalid memory address is returned but not checked by the caller before dereferencing, potentially causing a crash.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Missing return-value validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Dereferencing an invalid pointer can lead to a crash.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered in code paths that call `PyArray_DescrNew` and subsequently attempt to use the returned pointer without checking for errors.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker does not require any specific capabilities or position. It is triggered by supplying arguments that lead to a failed allocation within PyArray_DescrNew, resulting in a NULL return which is not checked and is dereferenced. This code can be reached within normal program execution."
