# A use of uninitialized value vulnerability in Tensorflow

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-7r94-xv9v-63jw
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

TensorFlow's Grappler optimizer has a [use of unitialized variable](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/3457a2b122e50b4d44ceaaed5a663d635e5c22df/tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/auto_parallel.cc#L155-L164):

```
  const NodeDef* dequeue_node;
  for (const auto& train_node : train_nodes) {
    if (IsDequeueOp(*train_node)) {
      dequeue_node = train_node;
      break;
    }
  }

  if (dequeue_node) {
    ...
  }
```

If the `train_nodes` vector (obtained from the saved model that gets optimized) does not contain a `Dequeue` node, then `dequeue_node` is left unitialized.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [68867bf01239d9e1048f98cbad185bf4761bedd3](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/68867bf01239d9e1048f98cbad185bf4761bedd3).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by Qian Feng from Baidu Security Team.
