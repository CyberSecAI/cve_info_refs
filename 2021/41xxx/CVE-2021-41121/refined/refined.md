Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41121:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from an incorrect pointer to the top of the stack when a function call is made inside a literal struct. This leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption due to an incorrect stack pointer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The memory corruption can lead to undefined behavior, potentially causing crashes or exploitable conditions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a function call is made within a literal struct.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to craft a Vyper contract that includes a function call inside a literal struct to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in version 0.3.0 of the Vyper compiler.
- The vulnerability is related to the internal calling convention of the Vyper compiler.
- The pull request #2447 addresses this vulnerability and involves a rewrite of the internal calling convention.
