**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page with predefined data for specific URLs (/userprofiles/edituserprofile.php and /users/edituser.php) that submit POST requests.
- The attacker then tricks an authenticated administrator user into visiting the crafted web page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host and serve a malicious HTML page.
- The attacker needs to entice a logged-in administrator to visit the malicious page.
- The attacker does not need prior access to the webTareas application.
