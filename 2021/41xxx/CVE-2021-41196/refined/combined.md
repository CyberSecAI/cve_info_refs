## Description

![@lugalUrim](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/81953879?v=4&size=48)[lugalUrim](https://github.com/lugalUrim)opened [on Sep 10, 2021](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/51936#issue-993613787)

**System information**

* Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): yes
* OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04
* Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: n/a
* TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
* TensorFlow version (use command below): 2.6.0
* Python version: 3.6.8
* Bazel version (if compiling from source): n/a
* GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source): n/a
* CUDA/cuDNN version: n/a
* GPU model and memory: n/a

**Describe the current behavior**

`tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling3D` crashes when `pool_size` contains `0`, and outputs a all-inf tensor when `pool_size` contains negative values.

**Describe the expected behavior**

Expect a `ValueError` to be thrown if the input `pool_size` contains zero or negative values.

**Standalone code to reproduce the issue**

If the `pool_size` has `0`:

```
import tensorflow as tf
pool_size = [2, 2, 0]
layer = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling3D(strides=1, pool_size=pool_size)
input_tensor = tf.random.uniform([3, 4, 10, 11, 12], dtype=tf.float32)
res = layer(input_tensor) # crash

```

Outputs:

```
Floating point exception (core dumped)

```

If the `pool_size` has negative values:

```
import tensorflow as tf
pool_size = [2, 2, -2]
layer = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling3D(strides=1, pool_size=pool_size,)
input_tensor = tf.random.uniform([3, 4, 10, 11, 12], dtype=tf.float32)
res = layer(input_tensor)
print(res)

```

The output is a tensor with `shape`=`(3, 3, 9, 14, 12)` and all `inf` values.

# Crash in `max\_pool3d` when size argument is 0 or negative

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-m539-j985-hcr8
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

The Keras pooling layers can trigger a segfault if the size of the pool is 0 or if a dimension is negative:

```
import tensorflow as tf

pool_size = [2, 2, 0]
layer = tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling3D(strides=1, pool_size=pool_size)
input_tensor = tf.random.uniform([3, 4, 10, 11, 12], dtype=tf.float32)
res = layer(input_tensor)
```

This is due to the TensorFlow's implementation of pooling operations where the values in the sliding window are not checked to be strictly positive.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [12b1ff82b3f26ff8de17e58703231d5a02ef1b8b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/12b1ff82b3f26ff8de17e58703231d5a02ef1b8b) (merging [#51975](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51975)).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
