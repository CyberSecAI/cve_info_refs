Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41196:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling3D` implementation within TensorFlow. The pooling operation does not validate if the `pool_size` argument contains non-positive values. Specifically, it does not check for zero or negative values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of input validation:** The `MaxPooling3D` operation does not enforce that the `pool_size` dimensions are strictly positive.
- **Undefined behavior:** When the `pool_size` contains a zero, the operation results in a crash (segmentation fault). When the `pool_size` contains negative values, it results in an output tensor filled with `inf` values, which is unexpected and indicative of incorrect computation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Providing a `pool_size` with a zero dimension will cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.
- **Unexpected Output/Incorrect Results:** Supplying a `pool_size` with negative dimensions will lead to an output tensor with `inf` values, potentially causing incorrect results and compromising the reliability of a model.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by passing a crafted `pool_size` argument to the `tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling3D` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to control or influence the `pool_size` argument passed to `tf.keras.layers.MaxPooling3D`. This could be achieved if the attacker can influence the model architecture or provide user inputs to a model that uses this layer.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was reported through a GitHub issue: [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/51936](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/51936)
- The fix was implemented in commit [https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/12b1ff82b3f26ff8de17e58703231d5a02ef1b8b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/12b1ff82b3f26ff8de17e58703231d5a02ef1b8b)
- The fix involves adding a check to ensure all values in the `pool_size` are strictly positive. This check throws an `InvalidArgumentError` if the `pool_size` contains 0 or negative values.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity.
- Patched versions are 2.4.4, 2.5.2, and 2.6.1.
- Affected versions are all versions prior to 2.7.0.
