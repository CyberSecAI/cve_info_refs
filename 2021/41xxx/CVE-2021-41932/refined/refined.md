- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Blind SQL injection vulnerability in search forms.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application's search inputs are vulnerable to blind SQL injection. Malicious SQL queries injected into these inputs can be evaluated by the database.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to complete database compromise, unauthorized access to audit data, and gaining information about other users.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through multiple search inputs within the application. Specific vulnerable locations include:
    - RAAP/Insert/Planning-Closure step/Search form
    - RAAP/Insert/Key Risk area/Search form
    - RAAP/Insert/Control/Search form
    - RAAP/Insert/Control/Control and test procedure/Search form
    - TeamInsights Reports/Get Report/Search form
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the TeamMate+ application. The attacker then can use the vulnerable search inputs to inject SQL queries.
