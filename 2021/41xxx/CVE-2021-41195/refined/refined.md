Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the implementation of `tf.math.segment_*` operations within TensorFlow. When a large segment ID is provided in the `segment_ids` input, the calculation of the output shape using `AddDim` can overflow an `int64_t` value. This overflow leads to a `CHECK` failure within the `AddDim` function, resulting in a program abort.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow when calculating the output shape due to a large segment ID.
*   **Lack of Proper Error Handling:** Instead of gracefully handling the overflow, the code triggers a `CHECK` failure, leading to a program termination.
*   **Insecure usage of `AddDim`:** The code should use `AddDimWithStatus` to handle the possibility of an overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing a large segment ID in the `segment_ids` input to `tf.math.segment_*` operations. This triggers the `CHECK` failure and aborts the TensorFlow program.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input:** An attacker can craft malicious input data containing a large `segment_ids` value when calling one of the affected `tf.math.segment_*` functions

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to provide input data to a TensorFlow model/application that uses the vulnerable `tf.math.segment_*` operations.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `tf.math.segment_max`, `tf.math.segment_min`, `tf.math.segment_mean`, `tf.math.segment_sum`, and `tf.math.segment_prod` operations.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by using  `AddDimWithStatus` which handles potential overflow when calculating the output shape.
*   The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1, and 2.7.0
