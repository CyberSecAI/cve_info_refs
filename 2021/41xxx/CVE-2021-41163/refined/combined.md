Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

stable <= 2.7.8; beta <= 2.8.0.beta6; tests-passed <= 2.8.0.beta6

## Patched versions

stable >= 2.7.9; beta >= 2.8.0.beta7; tests-passed >= 2.8.0.beta7

## Description

### Impact

A validation bug in the upstream aws-sdk-sns gem can lead to RCE in Discourse via a maliciously crafted request.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest **stable**, **beta** and **tests-passed** versions of Discourse.

### Workarounds

To workaround the issue without updating, requests with a path starting `/webhooks/aws` could be blocked at an upstream proxy.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
