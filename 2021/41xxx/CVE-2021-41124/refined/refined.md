Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41124:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper use of Scrapy's `HttpAuthMiddleware` for Splash authentication. This middleware applies authentication credentials to *all* requests made by the Scrapy spider, not just those intended for the Splash server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Credential Exposure:** When `HttpAuthMiddleware` is used with `http_user` and `http_pass` spider attributes for Splash authentication, these credentials are added to the headers of every request. This includes non-Splash requests such as those to `robots.txt` when `ROBOTSTXT_OBEY` is enabled, potentially leaking the Splash server's authentication details to unintended targets.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Exposure of Splash Credentials:** An attacker, by controlling a website that is scraped, can gain access to the Splash server's basic authentication credentials, allowing access to the Splash server.
- **Unintended Access:** If the Splash server is exposed to the internet, this could result in unauthorized access to the Splash server from a third party.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-middle:** An attacker could intercept the request and steal the credentials.
- **Malicious Website:** A malicious website could receive the leaked authentication information when the Scrapy spider attempts to fetch its `robots.txt` file or other resources.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Website Control:** The attacker needs control over a website that is scraped by a vulnerable Scrapy spider.
- **Passive Eavesdropping:** Attackers could passively eavesdrop on HTTP traffic if unencrypted.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects versions of `scrapy-splash` prior to 0.8.0.
- The fix involves using the new `SPLASH_USER` and `SPLASH_PASS` settings to securely set authentication credentials for Splash requests only.
- Workarounds include setting Splash credentials per request using `splash_headers` or disabling the `robots.txt` middleware, but upgrading is the recommended solution.
