Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41153:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a specification non-compliance in the implementation of the `JUMPI` opcode within the `evm` crate before version 0.31.0. Specifically, the condition check for the `JUMPI` instruction was performed *after* the destination validity check, which is contrary to the behavior of Geth and OpenEthereum.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Specification Non-compliance:** The primary weakness is the incorrect order of operations during the execution of the `JUMPI` opcode. The Ethereum specification mandates that the condition check should precede the destination validity check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **High Severity on Ethereum Mainnet:** The impact is considered high if the `evm` crate is used on the Ethereum mainnet, because this non-compliance could potentially be exploited.
- **Low Severity on Frontier/Standalone Blockchains:** The impact is low in Frontier or standalone blockchains, as no known exploits are possible in these environments. However, it is still advised to eventually apply the fix in these environments as part of the general upgrade process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting specific EVM bytecode that leverages the incorrect `JUMPI` instruction behavior, likely leading to unexpected code execution flow or denial of service by jumping to an invalid address when the condition is actually false.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to deploy or execute EVM bytecode on a system that relies on a vulnerable version of the `evm` crate (version < 0.31.0).

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was introduced in version 0.31.0 of the `evm` crate, which is available on the `cargo` package manager.
- The vulnerability was reported by @rakita.
- The fix is detailed in pull request #67 on the rust-ethereum/evm GitHub repository.
- The advisory also gives specific instructions on how to properly update the affected `pallet-evm` based Substrate blockchains to mitigate this issue.
