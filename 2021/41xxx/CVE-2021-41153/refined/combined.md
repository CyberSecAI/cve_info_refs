# Specification non-compliance in JUMPI

High

[sorpaas](/sorpaas)
published
GHSA-pvh2-pj76-4m96
Oct 18, 2021

## Package

cargo

evm
([Rust](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arust))

## Affected versions

< 0.31.0

## Patched versions

>= 0.31.0

## Description

### Impact

In `evm` crate `< 0.31.0`, `JUMPI` opcode's condition is checked after the destination validity check. However, according to Geth and OpenEthereum, the condition check should happen before the destination validity check.

### Patches

This is a **high** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate for Ethereum mainnet. In this case, you should update your library dependency immediately to on or after `0.31.0`.

This is a **low** severity security advisory if you use `evm` crate in Frontier or in a standalone blockchain, because there's no security exploit possible with this advisory. It is **not** recommended to update to on or after `0.31.0` until all the normal chain upgrade preparations have been done. If you use Frontier or other `pallet-evm` based Substrate blockchain, please ensure to update your `spec_version` before updating this. For other blockchains, please make sure to follow a hard-fork process before you update this.

### Workarounds

If you are dependent on an older version of `evm` and cannot update due to API interface changes, please contact Wei by email (wei@that.world), who will be happy to help you to publish patch releases for older `evm` versions.

### References

Fix PR: [#67](https://github.com/rust-ethereum/evm/pull/67)

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in the `evm` repo.

### Special thanks

Special thanks to [@rakita](https://github.com/rakita) for reporting this issue.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41153

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
