- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unadvertised HTTP endpoint accessible only from the server side allows resetting the system user password.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability combined with an insecure internal endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can reset the system user password, gaining access as the system user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker must first exploit an existing SSRF vulnerability, then discover and use the vulnerable internal HTTP endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to perform Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
