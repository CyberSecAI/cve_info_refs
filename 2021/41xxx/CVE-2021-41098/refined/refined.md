Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41098:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default behavior of the SAX parser in Nokogiri on JRuby, where it resolves external entities. This is an Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The core vulnerability is the improper handling of external entities by the SAX parser. When parsing XML or HTML documents, the parser attempts to resolve external entities defined within the document. If an attacker controls the document, they can inject malicious external entity declarations that point to local or remote resources, potentially leading to data exposure, denial of service, or other attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access sensitive files on the server or network.
- **Denial of Service:** By referencing extremely large external entities, an attacker could potentially cause the server to consume excessive resources, leading to a denial of service condition.
- **Other Attacks:** The ability to resolve external entities could also open doors to other forms of attack such as SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious XML/HTML Documents:** The primary attack vector involves crafting malicious XML or HTML documents that contain carefully crafted external entity declarations. These documents can then be submitted for parsing using the affected Nokogiri classes.
- **Parsing Untrusted Input:** The vulnerability occurs when parsing untrusted documents that may contain malicious external entity references.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Supply Malicious Documents:** The attacker must be able to provide the application with a malicious XML or HTML document. This could be via direct upload, crafted requests or any other way that the application can read external input.
- **Target Uses JRuby:** The vulnerability is specific to Nokogiri when used on JRuby.
- **Target Uses SAX Parser:** The target application needs to be using one of the vulnerable classes:
    - `Nokogiri::XML::SAX::Parser`
    - `Nokogiri::HTML4::SAX::Parser` (or its alias `Nokogiri::HTML::SAX::Parser`)
    - `Nokogiri::XML::SAX::PushParser`
    - `Nokogiri::HTML4::SAX::PushParser` (or its alias `Nokogiri::HTML::SAX::PushParser`)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability does not affect CRuby users.
- The fix for this vulnerability involves disabling external entity resolution by default.
- The severity is rated as High (CVSS 7.5).
