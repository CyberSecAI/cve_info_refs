    "summary": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in Pterodactyl Panel related to two-factor authentication. An attacker can bypass authentication by manipulating the `confirmation_token` to reference an arbitrary cache value, potentially leading to unauthorized access to another user's account.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the two-factor authentication process where the `LoginCheckpointController` uses a user-controlled `confirmation_token` to retrieve a user ID from the cache. This token is expected to be a random string referencing a cached user ID. However, the system doesn't validate that the token is associated with the current login attempt, allowing an attacker to manipulate the token and reference other cached integer values, potentially corresponding to different user IDs.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper input validation of the `confirmation_token` in `LoginCheckpointController@__invoke`.",
        "Lack of verification that the cached user ID corresponds to the user attempting to log in.",
        "Absence of rate-limiting for two-factor authentication attempts after referencing a valid user account, allowing brute-force attacks on the 2FA code."
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious actor can potentially bypass two-factor authentication and log in as another user without knowing their email or password. This can lead to unauthorized access to the targeted user's account and its associated resources.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks through manipulation of the `confirmation_token` during the two-factor authentication process."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify HTTP requests to change the `confirmation_token` value during the login process. They also need to know or guess a valid cached integer value that references a different user's ID and be able to provide a valid two-factor authentication code."
