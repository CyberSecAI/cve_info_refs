{
  "related": true,
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a potential buffer overflow in the `array_from_pyobj` function in `fortranobject.c` due to using `strcpy`, `sprintf`, and `strcat` without proper bounds checking when constructing an error message.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Inadequate bounds checking"
    ],
    "impact": "A buffer overflow could lead to a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution if the overflow is carefully crafted.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be triggered via the `array_from_pyobj` function, which is part of the `numpy.f2py` component, by providing input that causes the error message buffer to overflow during string construction using `strcpy`, `sprintf`, and `strcat`.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to provide input that causes the error message construction to exceed the bounds of the `mess` buffer. This can be done by triggering a condition where `count_negative_dimensions(rank,dims) > 0` is true, and `rank` is close to its maximum `F2PY_MAX_DIMS` (40). The values of `dims[i]` also need to result in a long string representation, e.g. by being negative numbers."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The issue report on GitHub provides source code and a detailed description of how the vulnerable code can be reached, and how an overflow may occur. It suggests using safer alternatives such as `strncpy`, `strncat`, and `snprintf` to prevent the buffer overflow. This report has more information than the official CVE description."
