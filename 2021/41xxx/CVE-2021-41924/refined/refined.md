Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of `v-html` directive in `packages/Webkul/UI/src/Resources/assets/js/components/datagrid/table-body.vue` component. This directive renders raw HTML content, which can be exploited to inject malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unsafe HTML Rendering: The `v-html` directive renders data as HTML without proper sanitization, which is vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application.
- This code could be used to:
    - Steal user session cookies
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user
    - Deface the website
    - Gain access to sensitive user data

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious input to the `row[column.index]` variable used by `getRowContent`.
- Data sources that populate the datagrid could be compromised with malicious HTML.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to find a way to inject malicious HTML content into the data used by the datagrid. This could potentially be achieved by:
   - Directly modifying data in the backend database
   - Exploiting another vulnerability that enables injection of unsanitized HTML
   - Manipulating data passed through an API that is used to populate the datagrid.

**Mitigation:**
The fix implemented in commit `882dc2e7e7e9149b96cf1ccacf34900960b92fb7` replaces `v-html` with `v-text`. The `v-text` directive renders the content as plain text, which prevents the execution of any malicious scripts.

**Additional Notes:**
- The commit message "fixed xss issue at datagrid" clearly indicates this is a fix for an XSS vulnerability.
- The specific change in `table-body.vue` shows the removal of `v-html` and the addition of `v-text`.
- The provided content gives more specific detail than a typical CVE description.
