Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stemmed from a missing API key requirement for the `/v1/products` endpoint in the `website.py` file. This allowed unauthenticated access to product files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness was the lack of proper authentication for the `/v1/products` endpoint. Specifically, the absence of the `@require_apikey` decorator, which was intended to enforce API key validation.
- **Insecure Direct Object Reference:** Without authentication, the system effectively exposed product files directly without access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access to Product Files:** An attacker, knowing the API URL, could retrieve product files without proper authorization. This could lead to data breaches and potential misuse of sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct API Access:** The attack vector was a direct request to the vulnerable API endpoint `/v1/products` without providing a valid API key.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of API URL:** The attacker only needed to know the API URL to exploit this vulnerability. No specific user privileges or network access beyond reachability of the API was required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix was implemented by adding the `@require_apikey` decorator to the `/v1/products` route in `BOT/lib/cogs/website.py`.
- The vulnerability was found in versions <= 1.0.1 and patched in version 1.0.2.
- The content explicitly mentions the CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-116. However, CWE-116 is "Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output", which does not seem relevant for this particular vulnerability. A more suitable CWE would be CWE-287 "Improper Authentication" or CWE-639 "Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key" as the vulnerability was a missing authentication check.
