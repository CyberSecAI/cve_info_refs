Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-41104

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The `web_server` component in ESPHome versions 2021.9.1 and earlier allowed Over-The-Air (OTA) updates without properly checking the user-defined basic authentication username and password.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Missing Authentication Check:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of an authentication check for OTA update requests when basic authentication is configured for the `web_server` component.
*   **Bypass of Authentication:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized users to bypass the configured basic authentication and trigger OTA updates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Firmware Updates:** A remote attacker could potentially upload and install malicious firmware onto vulnerable devices, leading to a complete compromise.
*   **Denial of Service:**  An attacker could overwrite the firmware to render the device unusable.
*   **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious firmware could be designed to steal sensitive data from the device or the network it is connected to.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device where the `web_server` component is enabled and basic authentication is configured.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is carried out through specially crafted HTTP requests to the device's web server on the OTA update endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or have network access to the device if it's exposed on the internet.
*   No specific credentials are required as the basic authentication mechanism is bypassed.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as **High** severity.
*   The issue was patched in version 2021.9.2.
*   A temporary workaround is to disable or remove the `web_server` component.
*   The vulnerability was reported by andir.
