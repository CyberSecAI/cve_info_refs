# XSS vulnerability allowing arbitrary JavaScript execution

Moderate

[daniellee](/daniellee)
published
GHSA-3j9m-hcv9-rpj8
Nov 3, 2021

## Package

/dashboard/snapshot, grafana/public/app/angular/AngularApp.ts
(Grafana)

## Affected versions

>=8.0.0-beta1

## Patched versions

8.2.3

## Description

Today we are releasing Grafana 8.2.3. This patch release includes an important security fix for an issue that affects all Grafana versions from 8.0.0-beta1.

[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have already been patched and an audit did not find any usage of this attack vector. [Grafana Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise) customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.

## [CVE-2021-41174](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3j9m-hcv9-rpj8 "CVE-2021-41174") XSS vulnerability on unauthenticated pages

### Summary

CVSS Score: 6.9 Medium

CVSS:[CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:R/CR:L/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:N/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:N/MI:H/MA:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:R/CR:L/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:N/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:N/MI:H/MA:L)

We received a security report to security@grafana.com on 2021-10-21 about a vulnerability in Grafana regarding the XSS vulnerability.

It was later identified as affecting Grafana versions from 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.2.2. [CVE-2021-41174](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41174) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

### Impact

If an attacker is able to convince a victim to visit a URL referencing a vulnerable page, arbitrary JavaScript content may be executed within the context of the victim's browser.

The user visiting the malicious link must be unauthenticated and the link must be for a page that contains the login button in the menu bar.

There are two ways an unauthenticated user can open a page in Grafana that contains the login button:

* Anonymous authentication is enabled. This means all pages in Grafana would be open for the attack.
* The link is to an unauthenticated page. The following pages are vulnerable:
  + `/dashboard-solo/snapshot/*`
  + `/dashboard/snapshot/*`
  + `/invite/:code`

The url has to be crafted to exploit AngularJS rendering and contain the interpolation binding for AngularJS expressions. AngularJS uses double curly braces for interpolation binding: {{ }}

An example of an expression would be: `{{constructor.constructor(‘alert(1)’)()}}`. This can be included in the link URL like this:

[https://play.grafana.org/dashboard/snapshot/%7B%7Bconstructor.constructor('alert(1)')()%7D%7D?orgId=1](https://play.grafana.org/dashboard/snapshot/%7B%7Bconstructor.constructor%28%27alert%281%29%27%29%28%29%7D%7D?orgId=1)

When the user follows the link and the page renders, the login button will contain the original link with a query parameter to force a redirect to the login page. The URL is not validated and the AngularJS rendering engine will execute the JavaScript expression contained in the URL.

### Attack audit

We can not guarantee that the below will identify all attacks, so if you find something using the audit process described below, you should consider doing a full assessment.

#### Through reverse proxy/load balancer logs

To determine if your Grafana installation has been exploited for this vulnerability, search through your reverse proxy/load balancer access logs for instances where the path contains `{{` followed by something that would invoke JavaScript code. For example, this could be code that attempts to show a fake login page or to steal browser or session data. The [OWASP cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet.html) has several examples of XSS attacks.

#### Through the Grafana Enterprise audit feature

If you enabled “Log web requests” in your configuration with `router_logging = true`, look for requests where `path` contains `{{` followed by something that would invoke JavaScript code.

### Patched versions

Release 8.2.3:

* [Download Grafana 8.2.3](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/8.2.3)
* [Release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-8-2-3/)

### Solutions and mitigations

Download and install the appropriate patch for your version of Grafana.

[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have already been patched, and [Grafana Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise) customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.

### Workaround

If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to block the literal string `{{` in the path.

Example of an Nginx rule to block the literal string `{{`:

```
location ~ \{\{ {
    deny all;
}

```
### Timeline and postmortem

Umesh has been focused on infrastructure and app modernization, as well as observability solutions including the Grafana LGTM Stack, for the past two years.</em></p>
<p>With the <a href="/grafana/plugins/grafana-bigquery-datasource/">Google BigQuery data source plugin</a> for Grafana, you can easily query and visualize data from BigQuery directly in Grafana. This enables a wide range of use cases, such as creating dashboards for log analysis, billing data, sales metrics, traffic analysis, and digital marketing campaign tracking.</p>
<p>When running Grafana on Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) and connecting to BigQuery as a data source, it&rsquo;s essential to prioritize security. This blog explores how Workload Identity Federation can help you securely connect a Grafana instance running on GKE to the Google BigQuery service without exposing a service account key.</p>
<h2 id="authentication-with-gcp-using-workload-identity-federation">Authentication with GCP using Workload Identity Federation</h2>
<p>You can securely access Google Cloud APIs from your workloads running in GKE clusters by using <a href="https://cloud.google.com/iam/docs/workload-identity-federation" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Workload Identity Federation</a> for GKE.</p>
<p>If you are running Grafana on GKE in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/autopilot-overview" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Autopilot </a>mode, Workload Identity Federation is enabled by default. When you are running in <a href="https://cloud.google.com/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/choose-cluster-mode" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Standard</a> mode, you enable Workload Identity Federation on clusters and node pools using the Google Cloud CLI or the Google Cloud console. Workload Identity Federation for GKE must be enabled at the cluster level before you can enable it for GKE on node pools.</p>
<p>To enable on a new cluster:</p>

<p>To let your GKE application â in our case, Grafana â authenticate to Google Cloud APIs using Workload Identity Federation for GKE, you need to create IAM policies for the specific APIs.</p>
<p>If you are using a Helm chart, just edit this code to values.yaml.</p>

<p>If you are deploying as a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/workloads/controllers/deployment/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes deployment</a>, create a <a href="https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-service-account/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Kubernetes service account</a> for Grafana to use. You can also use any existing Kubernetes service account in any namespace. If you don&rsquo;t assign a service account to your workload, Kubernetes assigns the default service account in the namespace.</p>
<p>Grant your IAM service account the roles that it needs on specific Google Cloud APIs. In our case, Grafana wants to query the BigQuery API, so we will give it the <a href="https://cloud.google.com/bigquery/docs/access-control#bigquery.admin" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">BigQuery Admin role</a> (but, in general, always follow the principle of least privilege).</p>

<p>In the code block below, <code>KSA\_NAME</code> represents the Kubernetes service account name attached to the Grafana workload, and<code>NAMESPACE</code> represents the namespace on which Grafana is deployed.</p>

<h2 id="privilege-escalation-vulnerability-for-organizations-in-grafana-cve-2024-9476httpsgrafanacomsecuritysecurity-advisoriescve-2024-9476">Privilege escalation vulnerability for Organizations in Grafana (<a href="/security/security-advisories/cve-2024-9476/">CVE-2024-9476</a>)</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A privilege escalation vulnerability was discovered in self-managed Grafana OSS v11.2 and Grafana Enterprise v11.2 during routine internal testing. The vulnerability allows users to gain access to resources from other organizations within the same Grafana instance via the Grafana Cloud Migration Assistant.</p>
<p>The Grafana Cloud Migration Assistant was <a href="/blog/2024/08/28/grafana-11.2-release-all-the-new-features/#migration-assistant-for-grafana-cloud">introduced in Grafana 11.2.0</a> in public preview and is only available when a user with Admin access enables the corresponding feature toggle.</p>
<p>Note: This vulnerability will <em>only</em> affect users who utilize the <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/administration/organization-management/">Organizations </a>feature to isolate resources on their Grafana instance.</p>
<p>The CVSS v3.1 score for this vulnerability is <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N/E:X/RL:W/RC:C/CR:M/IR:H/AR:H/MAV:L/MAC:L/MPR:H/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:H/MI:N/MA:N&amp;version=3.1" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5.4 Medium</a>.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>Some users leverage the <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/administration/organization-management/">Organizations</a> feature to isolate multiple resources within a single Grafana instance. However, the Grafana Cloud Migration Assistant feature did not restrict the resources shown within an instance; therefore, it did not limit a user&rsquo;s access to their assigned organization. Instead, the assistant showed and migrated all the resources within the instance, and did not consider the userâs permissions (Viewer, Editor, or Admin) within the Organization. This means that some users could view resources from other organizations that are within the same Grafana instance.</p>
<h3 id="impacted-versions">Impacted versions</h3>
<ul>
<li>Grafana OSS and Grafana Enterprise 11.3.0 to 11.3.0+security-01</li>
<li>Grafana OSS and Grafana Enterprise 11.2.0 to 11.2.3+security-01</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="solutions-and-mitigations">Solutions and mitigations</h3>

<h2 id="command-injection-and-local-file-inclusion-via-sql-expressions-cve-2024-9264">Command injection and local file inclusion via SQL Expressions (CVE-2024-9264)</h2>
<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A Grafana Labs engineer discovered a RCE (Remote Code Execution) vulnerability that was introduced in Grafana 11. The vulnerability was in an experimental feature named SQL Expressions that allows for data source query output to be post-processed by executing one or more SQL queries. It does this by passing the query and data to the DuckDB CLI, which executes the SQL against the DataFrame data. These SQL queries were <em>not</em> sanitized completely, leading to a command injection and local file inclusion vulnerability.</p>
<p>Because of an incorrect implementation of feature flags, this experimental feature is enabled by default for the API. <strong>However, to be exploitable, the DuckDB binary must be accessible through the PATH of the Grafana processâ environment.</strong> The DuckDB binary is not packaged with Grafana by default, so to be exploitable, the system must have DuckDB installed and included in Grafanaâs PATH. If DuckDB is not present, the system is not vulnerable.</p>
<p>The CVSS v3.1 score for this vulnerability is <a href="https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H&amp;version=3.1" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">9.9 Critical</a>.</p>
<p>Appropriate patches have been applied to Grafana Cloud. As always, we also closely coordinated with all cloud providers licensed to offer Grafana Cloud Pro. They received early notification under embargo and confirmed that their offerings are secure at the time of this announcement. This is applicable to Amazon Managed Grafana and Azure Managed Grafana.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>The vulnerability could be used to access any file on the host machine, including any unencrypted passwords within those files. Any Grafana user who has Viewer permissions or higher is capable of executing this attack.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-and-mitigations">Solutions and mitigations</h3>
<p>If your instance is vulnerable, we strongly recommend upgrading to one of the patched versions of Grafana as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As a mitigation, remove the <code>duckdb</code> binary from PATH, or remove it entirely from the system. No other Grafana feature requires it, and the binary is not present in normal distributions.</p>

<h3 id="summary">Summary</h3>
<p>A vulnerability has been discovered in the Grafana application related to the <code>/api/ruler/{DatasourceUID}/api/v1/rules/{Namespace}</code> endpoint. This endpoint allows Grafana users to edit alerting and recording rules stored in external data sources. We discovered that the endpoint had an incorrect RBAC action assigned to it. The endpoint was documented to check for <code>alert.rules.external:write</code>, but instead checked for the action <code>alert.instances.external:write</code>. This allowed users that had permission to edit alert instances in the data source to also create, edit, and delete alert rules without permission.</p>
<p>The CVSS v4.0 vulnerability score is a <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/4.0#CVSS:4.0/AV:N/AC:L/AT:N/PR:H/UI:N/VC:L/VI:L/VA:L/SC:N/SI:N/SA:N" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">5.1 Medium</a>.</p>
<h3 id="impact">Impact</h3>
<p>If successfully exploited, this vulnerability could allow users to create and edit rules unexpectedly. An attacker can, in turn, create a rule that reads data source information that they otherwise would not have access to and leak that information via notifications.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-and-mitigations">Solutions and mitigations</h3>
<p>If your instance is vulnerable, we strongly recommend upgrading to one of the patched versions as soon as possible.</p>
<p>As a mitigation, we recommend Administrators audit their permissions to ensure that <code>alert.instances.external:write</code> is only applied to the expected groups.</p>

<h3 id="summary-1">Summary</h3>
<p>The Grafana Agent Flow Windows installer did not enclose the service executable paths in quotes. This could lead to an escalation of privileges by a local user on the machine. A local user could add an executable named <code>c:\Program.exe</code>, and Windows services would run that executable with elevated privileges instead of Grafana Agent Flow mode.</p>
<p>The CVSS 3.1 score for this vulnerability is 7.3 High (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).</p>
<h3 id="impact-1">Impact</h3>
<p>This allows an elevation of privileges by a local user on any Windows machine with Grafana Alloy installed.</p>
<h3 id="impacted-versions-1">Impacted versions</h3>
<p>All Grafana Agent Flow Windows mode versions prior to v0.43.2.</p>
<h3 id="solutions-and-mitigations-1">Solutions and mitigations</h3>
<p>It is recommended that you remove the Grafana Agent Flow mode installation and do a clean install. An update will not resolve the issue. An alternative would be to add the double quotes manually to:</p>

These interactions generate a massive volume of event logs, containing valuable information like user details, geographical locations, IP addresses, and more.</p>
<p>These logs are essential for security teams, especially in operations, because they&rsquo;re used to detect and respond to incidents effectively. However, integrating these logs into logging and SIEM platforms can be challenging.</p>
<p>In this blog post, we&rsquo;ll show you how to effectively set up and run our Okta logs collector to send logs to <a href="/oss/loki/?pg=blog&amp;plcmt=body-txt">Grafana Loki</a> instances on-premises or in the cloud. By configuring your environment variables, running the Okta logs collector Docker container, and utilizing the latest versions of Loki and <a href="/oss/alloy-opentelemetry-collector/?pg=blog&amp;plcmt=body-txt">Grafana Alloy</a>, you can monitor, analyze, and set alerts on your Okta logs for deeper insights and improved system security and operational capabilities.</p>
<h2 id="why-we-developed-the-okta-logs-collector">Why we developed the Okta logs collector</h2>
<p>Many IdPs offer REST APIs for fetching event logs, with <a href="https://developer.okta.com/docs/reference/api/system-log/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta&rsquo;s System Log API</a> providing logs in JSON format, as shown below. However, integrating these logs into existing systems often involves a complex and time-consuming process, typically requiring custom code to access the logs via an HTTP client library in programming languages like Go.</p>
<p>To simplify and streamline this process, we developed the <a href="https://github.com/grafana/okta-logs-collector" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Okta logs collector</a>. This tool automates the retrieval of logs from the Okta System Log API, enriches the data, and sends it to STDOUT, making it easy to scrape and forward the logs to observability platforms like Loki using agents such as Alloy or Promtail.</p>
<p>To further illustrate why we built the Okta logs collector, let&rsquo;s briefly look at the challenge developers face with fetching event logs and how we&rsquo;re attempting to address those challenges.</p>
<h3 id="json-log-event-example">JSON log event example</h3>

</div><p>Although Okta provides a Go SDK for easier integration, developers still need to write code to fetch and handle the logs, which can be cumbersome and prone to errors. This is where the Okta logs collector shines by automating the entire process.</p>
<h3 id="the-okta-logs-collector-solution">The Okta logs collector solution</h3>
<p>Our <code>okta-logs-collector</code> application periodically fetches logs from Oktaâs System Logs API and sends them to the STDOUT. Our solution works in a containerized environment, in which Alloy can discover Docker Engine, receive container logs, and forward them to Loki. Alternatively, you can pipe the application logs to a file on disk, which can then be monitored and read by Alloy using the <code>loki.source.file</code> <a href="/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/loki.source.file/">component</a> and sent to Loki. The containerized solution is shown in the diagram below:</p>

<p>To effectively set up and run the application, it&rsquo;s important to understand the <a href="https://github.com/grafana/okta-logs-collector/blob/main/examples/cloud-config.alloy" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">example configuration file for Alloy</a>. Components are the building blocks of Alloy, each handling a specific task such as retrieving logs or sending them to Loki. Reference documentation for each component can be found <a href="/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/?pg=blog&amp;plcmt=body-txt">here</a>. The example configuration file utilizes several components, which are explained below.</p>
<h3 id="component-1-discoverydocker">Component 1: <code>discovery.docker</code></h3>
<p>The <code>discovery.docker</code> <a href="/docs/alloy/latest/reference/components/discovery.docker/?pg=blog&amp;plcmt=body-txt">component</a> discovers<a href="https://docs.docker.com/engine/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"> Docker Engine</a> containers and exposes them as targets. This assumes that youâre running Docker Engine locally and you have access to the <code>docker.sock</code> Unix domain socket, which means that you are a member of the <code>docker</code> group on Linux or youâre running as root.</p>

<h2 id="how-to-use-sigma-rules-for-detecting-critical-log-lines">How to use Sigma rules for detecting critical log lines</h2>
<p>Ingesting logs into Loki is only half the equation; the other half is detecting critical log lines. These log lines provide crucial evidence, such as identifying whether corporate accounts have been compromised. While you can always write your own LogQL queries to detect specific issues, there are more efficient methods. One such method is leveraging the Sigma ecosystem, which offers an abundant set of declarative rules for discovering these pieces of evidence.</p>
<p>Fortunately, the security operations team has developed a backend for <a href="https://sigmahq.io/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sigma</a> that converts Sigma rules into Loki queries (LogQL queries). You can leverage <a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma/tree/master/rules/cloud/okta" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">existing Sigma rules for Okta</a> to detect critical log lines and set alerts to monitor these events. Follow the instructions provided in <a href="/blog/2022/12/15/a-guide-to-cyber-threat-hunting-with-promtail-grafana-loki-sigma-and-grafana-cloud/">this blog post</a> to install Sigma CLI and its plugins and to convert Sigma rules into LogQL queries.</p>
<p>Also, you can continuously validate your Sigma rules against the <a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-specification/blob/main/sigma-schema.json" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Sigma JSON Schema</a> by utilizing the <a href="https://github.com/SigmaHQ/sigma-rules-validator" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">sigma-rules-validator</a> GitHub Action. Follow the instructions in <a href="/blog/2024/03/25/how-to-validate-sigma-rules-with-github-actions-for-improved-security-monitoring/">this blog post</a> to learn more about the action and how to use it.</p>
<h2 id="whats-next">Whatâs next</h2>
<p>We hope this project can help you monitor your Okta logs more easily, but we&rsquo;re not done yet. Stay tuned for version 2 of the Okta logs collector, which we&rsquo;re developing as an Alloy component.

<p>Additionally, you can configure Grafana to use <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/#anonymous-authentication">Anonymous authentication</a>, which allows users to access Grafana without requiring any login.</p>
<p>Ultimately, your choice of authentication type depends on your organizationâs unique requirements. Most of these authentication methods also allow you to sync user permissions from external providers to Grafana and, therefore, easily control access. While this is beyond the scope of this blog post, you can read more in <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/setup-grafana/configure-security/configure-authentication/">our technical documentation</a>.</p>
<h2 id="why-use-sso-with-grafana">Why use SSO with Grafana?</h2>
<p>While SSO might not be applicable to all types of organizations and users, it comes with several advantages compared to other forms of authentication, including:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Enhanced security and better compliance</strong>: Centralized authentication reduces the risk of compromised credentials. It makes it easier to enforce policies and maintain audit trails, and also scales really well.</li>
<li><strong>Better user experience</strong>: Users can access Grafana resources without needing to log in separately (aka, no password fatigue), and administrators can manage user access and permissions from a centralized place (for example, their IdP).</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-new-in-grafana-sso-configuration">What&rsquo;s new in Grafana SSO configuration?</h2>
<p>Historically, configuring SSO in Grafana required updating static configuration files and restarting the Grafana instance for the changes to take effect. This process could be cumbersome and disruptive.</p>
<p>With the Grafana 10 release, we <a href="/blog/2023/07/27/new-in-grafana-10-a-ui-to-easily-configure-saml-authentication/">introduced a new UI to easily configure SAML authentication</a>. Thanks to feedback from our community, we decided to streamline the entire SSO setup process and introduced the following updates, starting with <a href="/blog/2024/04/09/grafana-11-release-all-the-new-features/">Grafana 11</a>:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>UI configuration</strong>: Configure SSO directly through the Grafana user interface.</li>
<li><strong>API support</strong>: Automate SSO setup and management using Grafana&rsquo;s API. <a href="/docs/grafana/latest/developers/http\_api/sso-settings/">Refer to the documentation</a> for more information.</li>
<li><strong>Terraform integration</strong>: Manage SSO configurations as code with Terraform support. <a href="https://registry.terraform.io/providers/grafana/grafana/latest/docs/resources/sso\_settings" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Refer to the documentation</a> for more information.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="configuration-files-vs-the-uiapi">Configuration files vs. the UI/API</h3>
<p>Configuring SSO through Grafana configuration files is still supported and might be applicable in certain scenarios, including when thereâs limited infrastructure automation. That said, using the UI or API instead of configuration files has the following advantages:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Available in Grafana Cloud</strong>: Set up SSO inside of your Grafana Cloud instance without needing to file a support request.</li>
<li><strong>Real-time configuration validation</strong>: When using the UI or API, all settings are validated in real time, providing immediate feedback on the validity of the configuration.</li>
<li><strong>No need to restart Grafana</strong>: Using the UI or API eliminates the need to restart Grafana after making changes.</li>
<li><strong>RBAC authorization</strong>: You have the flexibility to authorize specific users to access the UI or API by using role-based access control (RBAC).</li>
</ul>
<p>It is not recommended to mix configuration methods (for example, to define some fields in a config file and some through the API). If, for some reason, configuration has to be done using both options, Grafana will follow a specific precedence order when loading the configuration:</p>
<ol>
<li>Settings that were configured using the UI/API, or Terraform.</li>
<li>Settings from environment variables.</li>
<li>Settings from the Grafana configuration file.</li>
</ol>
<h2 id="exploring-the-authentication-user-interface">Exploring the Authentication user interface</h2>
<p>To access the UI in Grafana or Grafana Cloud, navigate to <strong>Administration &gt; Authentication</strong> in the navigation menu of your Grafana instance.</p>
<p>Please note that in order to access this page, a user must have the <em>settings:read</em> and <em>settings:write</em> permissions. By using the \*settings:auth.{provider}:\*\* scope with appropriate providers, you can control access by indicating which specific providers a user can set up.</p>
<p><img

height="1248"/></p>
<h2 id="best-practices-to-set-up-sso">Best practices to set up SSO</h2>
<p>Setting up SSO requires knowledge of both identity providers and Grafana. With hundreds of identity providers available, offering built-in support for all of them is not feasible. This is why Grafana supports a Generic OAuth configuration, which can be used to set up SSO with any identity provider that supports OAuth 2.0.</p>
<p>Here are a few generic guidelines to follow when setting up SSO in Grafana:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Understand your identity provider</strong>: Each IdP has specific requirements and quirks, so consult their documentation thoroughly before moving forward.</li>
<li><strong>Configure redirect Uniform Resource Identifier (URIs) correctly</strong>: Make sure the redirect URIs configured in your IdP match exactly with those specified in Grafana. Incorrect URIs can cause authentication failures.</li>
<li><strong>Avoid using Generic OAuth if your provider is supported by Grafana</strong>. If you are using Azure Active Directory, Okta, Google, GitHub or GitLab, use the appropriate configuration for them and avoid Generic OAuth. This approach simplifies setup and is less error-prone. Additionally, configuration is much more fine-grained, as certain functionality wonât be available with Generic OAuth.</li>
<li><strong>When using OAuth, configure <em>allowed\_domains, allowed\_groups</em> or <em>allowed\_organizations</em></strong>: This will reduce the attack surface for user accounts and create defense in depth (DiD) in case authentication is bypassed.</li>
<li><strong>Enable <em>use\_pkce=true</em> for OAuth integrations:</strong> <a href="https://auth0.com/docs/get-started/authentication-and-authorization-flow/authorization-code-flow-with-pkce" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Proof Key for Code Exchange (PKCE)</a> is an important addition to OAuth and it might be obligatory in future versions of the protocol. Enable it from the start to avoid breakage on IdP updates (itâs been enabled by default since Grafana 10.1).</li>
<li><strong>Use request signing when setting up SAML</strong>: Request signing is a critical security feature in SAML that enhances the overall security of the authentication process. It ensures SAML requests are genuine, unaltered, and originate from a trusted service provider, thereby protecting the system from various threats and ensuring compliance with security standards.</li>
<li><strong>Set up auto login</strong>: Available for OAuth and SAML, this will improve the user experience.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="troubleshooting-sso-setup">Troubleshooting SSO setup</h2>
<p>Setting up SSO requires configuration in multiple places, and sometimes, it doesnât work out the first time. Being prepared and having the right tools for debugging can streamline the process.</p>
<h3 id="be-familiar-with-identity-protocols">Be familiar with identity protocols</h3>
<p>Most of the authentication protocols involve browser redirects and HTTP requests/responses between several components, so troubleshooting will be easier if you are familiar with the expected sequence of interaction for a particular scenario. Specifically, it will be helpful to know:</p>
<ul>
<li>The parameters expected by each protocol endpoint</li>
<li>The responses and error codes returned by each endpoint</li>
<li>The identity provider APIs</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="have-the-right-tools">Have the right tools</h3>
<p>Tools to capture and view <strong>HTTP traces</strong> are especially helpful to troubleshoot during SSO setup. Most internet browsers offer dev tools with built-in capabilities to capture an HTTP trace in the &ldquo;Network&rdquo; tab. It is also convenient to be able to dump the HTTP trace to an HTTP Archive format (.har file), which will capture everything, including the cleartext value of any secret.</p>
<p>Other examples of tools for SSO debugging and troubleshooting include:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://www.postman.com/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Postman</a> or <a href="https://insomnia.rest/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Insomnia</a> to test API calls</li>

<li><a href="https://jwt.io/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">https://jwt.io/</a> to view and create JWTs</li>
<li>SAML-tracer, available for <a href="https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/saml-tracer/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Firefox</a> and <a href="https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/saml-tracer/mpdajninpobndbfcldcmbpnnbhibjmch?hl=en&amp;pli=1" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chrome</a>, to inspect SAML requests</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="know-these-debugging-basics">Know these debugging basics</h3>
<p>When something is not working as expected, especially when it comes to authentication, itâs best to start checking the simple things. For example:</p>
<ul>
<li>Check that the identity provider is accessible and not experiencing any issues</li>
<li>Ensure the supplied credentials are correct for the environment</li>
<li>Check that the login account and credentials are not disabled or expired</li>
<li>Make sure Grafana is using the correct URL for the identity provider</li>
<li>Verify the client ID matches the one registered in identity provider</li>
<li>Check the redirect/callback URL</li>
<li>Read all error messages to see if they provide valuable clues</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="whats-next">Whatâs next?</h2>
<p>We hope the recent updates weâve made related to the UI, API, and Terraform enhance your experience with Grafana and simplify the SSO setup process. Looking ahead, we plan to introduce a new UI and API for configuring LDAP, which will make authentication setup even easier.</p>

Data for these custom experiences can come from a variety of sources, including nested data sources. However, they can also come from third-party APIs, which usually require authentication to access.</p>
<p>This blog post explains, step by step, how to securely authenticate against third-party APIs when developing your Grafana app plugin. By the end, you&rsquo;ll understand how to handle authentication securely, ensuring that sensitive credentials are protected throughout interactions with third-party APIs.</p>
<p><em>Note: For those new to Grafana, it might be helpful to understand the distinctions between our panel plugins, data source plugins, and application plugins before continuing with this post. Each plugin type serves a unique purpose and has different capabilities within the Grafana ecosystem. You can find a detailed overview of each type in our <a href="/developers/plugin-tools/key-concepts/plugin-types-usage">developer documentation</a>.</em></p>
<h2 id="the-need-for-secure-authentication-with-third-party-apis">The need for secure authentication with third-party APIs</h2>
<p>When integrating with third-party APIs, it&rsquo;s crucial to secure your connection and use authentication credentials to protect sensitive data from unauthorized access. The mishandling of authentication can expose you to several risks, including credential leaks, man-in-the-middle attacks, replay attacks, impersonation, and compliance violations. This could happen, for example, if you simply store your API authentication credentials in plain text, directly inside your frontend components, and then use them to call a third-party API.</p>
<p>To avoid these risks, itâs essential to implement robust security measures for API credentials and ensure encrypted communications with third-party services.</p>
<h2 id="secure-api-authentication-in-grafana-app-plugins">Secure API authentication in Grafana app plugins</h2>
<p>While the following steps will help you securely authenticate against a third-party API within a Grafan app plugin, they can also be used within a backend data source plugin.</p>
<p>There are several best practices to ensure credentials are handled safely and that plugins do not expose sensitive information, either in transit or at rest:</p>
<ol>
<li><strong>In transit</strong>: Ensure youâre using HTTPS at all times to guarantee secure communication.</li>
<li><strong>At rest</strong>: Use <a href="/developers/plugin-tools/create-a-plugin/extend-a-plugin/add-authentication-for-data-source-plugins#store-configuration-in-securejsondata">Grafana&rsquo;s SecureJsonData</a> plugin configuration to securely store sensitive data like API keys.</li>
<li><strong>Minimize scope of visibility</strong>: Use the <a href="/developers/plugin-tools/key-concepts/backend-plugins/#resources">Resources feature</a> in the Grafana plugin architecture to act as an intermediary for requests to third-party APIs. This lets you securely fetch data in the frontend without exposing credentials to the client.</li>
</ol>

<h3 id="handling-api-keys">Handling API keys</h3>
<p>Grafana provides a mechanism to store sensitive information, such as API keys or passwords, using secure JSON data fields within the pluginâs configuration. These credentials are encrypted and can only be accessed server-side, ensuring they are not exposed in the browser.</p>
<p>When bootstrapping your Grafana app plugin, using the <a href="/developers/plugin-tools/#quick-start">Create Plugin CLI tool</a>, your app plugin source code will contain a configuration page with an example for storing secure credentials. This can be found in the <code>src/components/AppConfig/AppConfig.tsx</code> file.</p>

<p>You will see that there are two pieces of data being stored as part of the pluginâs configuration: <code>apiUrl</code> and <code>apiKey</code>.</p>
<p>Inside of the configuration pageâs source code, youâll notice the <strong>Submit</strong> button has an <code>onClick</code> handler that calls the <code>updatePluginAndReload</code> function as shown below:</p>
<div class="code-snippet code-snippet\_\_mini"><div class="lang-toolbar\_\_mini">
<span class="code-clipboard">
<button x-data="app\_code\_snippet()" x-init="init()" @click="copy()">
<img class="code-clipboard\_\_icon" src="/media/images/icons/icon-copy-small-2.svg" alt="Copy code to clipboard" width="14" height="13">

</button>
</span>
</div><div class="code-snippet code-snippet\_\_border">
<pre data-expanded="false"><code class="language-none">updatePluginAndReload(plugin.meta.id, {
enabled,
pinned,
jsonData: {
apiUrl: state.apiUrl,
},
secureJsonData: state.isApiKeySet
? undefined
: {
apiKey: state.apiKey,
},
})</code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>This call to the <code>updatePluginAndReload</code> function saves the userâs configuration form input in the pluginâs configuration settings. The <code>apiUrl</code> is being stored as plain JSON data, while the <code>apiKey</code> is being stored as secure JSON data. This means the frontend of your app plugin has no way to retrieve the raw value of the <code>apiKey</code> which can therefore only be used by the backend part of your plugin. This ensures that your API credentials remain private and secure.</p>
<p>Remember to run your development Grafana instance and navigate to your app pluginâs configuration page to update the configuration appropriately with your third-party API credentials.</p>
<p>Alternatively, for development purposes, you may want to enter default values for your pluginâs configuration via the <code>provisioning/plugins/app.yaml</code> file, as shown below. This will default your pluginâs configuration to the values entered in this file each time the Docker containers are restarted.</p>

<p>As mentioned earlier, it is incredibly important that you use HTTPS to create a secure connection to your API.</p>
<h3 id="creating-a-resources-endpoint-to-call-the-third-party-api">Creating a Resources endpoint to call the third-party API</h3>
<p>Grafana plugins can use the Resources functionality to allow the frontend to retrieve arbitrary data from the pluginâs backend. What you decide to expose via the Resources endpoints is entirely up to you as the developer, but in this instance, we will use a Resources endpoint to retrieve data from an authenticated third-party API.</p>
<p>Resources endpoints within your app plugin are configured inside the <code>pkg/plugin/resources.go</code> file. Inside this file there is a <code>registerRoutes</code> function that defines which Resources endpoints are available within your app plugin.</p>
<p>To register a new endpoint, define it within the <code>registerRoutes</code> function, as shown below:</p>
<div class="code-snippet code-snippet\_\_mini"><div class="lang-toolbar\_\_mini">
<span class="code-clipboard">
<button x-data="app\_code\_snippet()" x-init="init()" @click="copy()">

</span>
</div><div class="code-snippet code-snippet\_\_border">
<pre data-expanded="false"><code class="language-none">func (a \*App) registerRoutes(mux \*http.ServeMux) {
mux.HandleFunc(&#34;/ping&#34;, a.handlePing)
mux.HandleFunc(&#34;/echo&#34;, a.handleEcho)
mux.HandleFunc(&#34;/my-new-endpoint&#34;, a.handleMyNewEndpoint) // Newly registered endpoint
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>Above we have defined a new Resources endpoint that can be accessed at the Resources location for our plugin by the frontend â for example, <code>/api/plugins/&lt;your-plugin-id&gt;/resources/my-new-endpoint</code>.</p>
<p>This new endpoint is configured to be handled by a new function, <code>a.handleMyNewEndpoint</code>. We must implement this function, which is a standard Go HTTP handler, in order to return data to the frontend when the endpoint is called.</p>
<p>Letâs take a look at an example implementation that gets the API URL and API key from your plugin configuration, and then makes an authenticated HTTP request to the third-party API before returning the data to the client.</p>
<div class="code-snippet code-snippet\_\_mini"><div class="lang-toolbar\_\_mini">
<span class="code-clipboard">
<button x-data="app\_code\_snippet()" x-init="init()" @click="copy()">

return
}
// Get the Plugin context
pCtx := httpadapter.PluginConfigFromContext(req.Context())
// Get the API Key from the pluginâs secure JSON configuration data
apiKey, exists := pCtx.AppInstanceSettings.DecryptedSecureJSONData[&#34;apiKey&#34;]
if !exists {
http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
return
}
// Get the API URL from the pluginâs standard JSON configuration data
var config pluginConfig
if err := json.Unmarshal(pCtx.AppInstanceSettings.JSONData, &amp;config); err != nil {
http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
return
}
if config.ApiUrl == &#34;&#34; {
return nil, errors.New(&#34;no api url configured&#34;)
}
// Define the full API endpoint to call (in this instance the /profile endpoint of the third-party API)

apiReq, err := http.NewRequest(&#34;GET&#34;, apiUrl, nil)

}
defer apiResp.Body.Close()
// Read the response body

http.Error(w, err.Error(), http.StatusInternalServerError)
return
}
// Write the response body as JSON for the caller to consume
w.Header().Set(&#34;Content-Type&#34;, &#34;application/json&#34;)
w.Write(body)
}</code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>The above code uses the pluginâs configuration to call out to the authenticated third-party APIâs <code>/profile</code> endpoint and return the data to the client.</p>
<p>Remember, in order for this new Resources endpoint to take effect, the backend source code of the plugin must be rebuilt using the <code>mage -v build:linux</code> command and then the Docker containers must be restarted using Docker Compose.</p>
<h3 id="calling-the-resources-endpoint-from-the-frontend">Calling the Resources endpoint from the frontend</h3>
<p>Your pluginâs frontend can now use the newly created Resources endpoint to retrieve data from the authenticated third-party API.</p>
<p>To call the Resources endpoint, use the <code>getBackendSrv().fetch()</code> function, which is part of the <code>@grafana/runtime</code> package. We also use the <code>lastValueFrom</code> function, which is available as part of the <code>rxjs</code> package.</p>
<p>An example of this is shown below:</p>
<div class="code-snippet code-snippet\_\_mini"><div class="lang-toolbar\_\_mini">
<span class="code-clipboard">
<button x-data="app\_code\_snippet()" x-init="init()" @click="copy()">

});
const value = await lastValueFrom(response) as any;
console.log(value);</code></pre>
</div>
</div><p>The above code will make a call to the new Resources endpoint, grab the value from the response, and output it to the browserâs console.</p>

This collaboration will enable us to work more effectively with security researchers from around the world in a scalable, sustainable way.</p>
<p>Moving to a platform that handles initial triage will allow us to focus on valid reports and expand our scope, covering a wider range of Grafana Labs developed products and services. Let&rsquo;s take a look at how our new partnership with intigriti will work.</p>
<h2 id="faq-what-you-need-to-know">FAQ: What you need to know</h2>
<h3 id="what-is-the-scope-of-the-new-program">What is the scope of the new program?</h3>
<p>Currently, the eligible projects are <a href="/oss/">Grafana OSS</a> and our other open source backends (<a href="/oss/loki/">Grafana Loki</a>, <a href="/oss/mimir/">Grafana Mimir</a>, <a href="/oss/pyroscope/">Grafana Pyroscope</a>, and <a href="/oss/tempo/">Grafana Tempo</a>), but this relaunch allows us to progressively launch additional programs for new and existing products in the future.</p>
<h3 id="what-are-the-submission-requirements">What are the submission requirements?</h3>
<p>We will accept valid security vulnerabilities that exist in the latest released version of the products that are listed in scope. All eligible submissions must prove a security impact, and we reward based on the described impact in the submission provided by the researcher.</p>
<p>Any current or former (in the last 12 months) Grafana Labs employees and contractors are not permitted to participate in this program.</p>
<h3 id="what-happens-after-i-submit-a-reward-eligible-vulnerability-report">What happens after I submit a reward-eligible vulnerability report?</h3>
<p>Intigritiâs triage team will perform an initial assessment of the submission before we review it, meaning they will verify that the vulnerability is in scope, is not a duplicate, and is reproducible. If those criteria are met, we (Grafana Labs) will perform a second round of reviews. This second round is intended to assess whether we already know about the issue internally or whether itâs intentional functionality.</p>
<p>If the submission is eligible for a reward, we will assess the severity based on the impact described in the report. We follow the <a href="https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">CVSS 3.1 scoring system</a>, so we will map bounties to a calculated CVSS score. If the report is of greater quality, we might offer a bonus bounty to incentivize clear and detailed reports.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-grafana-labs-response-time-to-submissions">What is Grafana Labs&rsquo; response time to submissions?</h3>
<p>After Intigriti has validated the submission, Grafana Labs will respond within the following timelines:</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Vulnerability Severity</strong>
</td>
<td><strong>Time to validate (working days)</strong>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Exceptional
</td>
<td>2
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Critical
</td>
<td>2
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>High
</td>
<td>5
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Medium
</td>
<td>15
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>Low
</td>
<td>15
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<p>Once a submission has been assigned to us, we will typically respond to it within two business days. We will reward on triage, meaning we will send the bounty regardless if the fix is published or not, as long as we have sufficient information to assess the impact.</p>
<h3 id="what-is-the-payment-structure-for-bounties">What is the payment structure for bounties?</h3>
<p>We will continue to offer top-tier and market competitive bounties. We used <a href="https://bountycalculator.intigriti.io/" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Intigritiâs bug bounty calculator</a> to calculate bounty levels that are above the industry median.</p>
<table>
<tr>
<td><strong>Severity </strong>(CVSS 3.1)
</td>
<td><strong>Minimum Bounty</strong>
</td>
<td><strong>Maximum Bounty</strong>
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Low</strong> (0.1 - 3.9)
</td>
<td>100 USD
</td>
<td>500 USD
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Medium</strong> (3.9 - 6.9)
</td>
<td>500 USD
</td>
<td>2,000 USD
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>High</strong> (7.0 - 8.9)
</td>
<td>2,000 USD
</td>
<td>7,500 USD
</td>

<tr>
<td><strong>Critical</strong> (9.0 - 9.4)
</td>
<td>7,500 USD
</td>
<td>10,000 USD
</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td><strong>Exceptional</strong> (9.5 - 10.0)
</td>
<td>10,000 USD
</td>
<td>15,000 USD
</td>
</tr>
</table>
<h3 id="how-are-bounties-paid-out">How are bounties paid out?</h3>
<p>All bounties will be paid out directly via the Intigriti platform. If the researcher wants to transfer the funds to their personal bank account, it usually takes three to five business days, <a href="https://kb.intigriti.com/en/articles/3379564-payout-lifecycle" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">according to Intigriti.</a></p>
<h3 id="will-grafana-labs-still-be-transparent-with-its-program">Will Grafana Labs still be transparent with its program?</h3>
<p>Currently, it is not possible to publish submissions on Intigriti. However, for all open source products that are in scope, we will assign a CVE. That CVE will be published in our <a href="/security/security-advisories/">CVE database</a>, where we will provide detailed information about the vulnerability.</p>
<p>For all published CVEs, we will continue to ask the researcher if they want to be credited in our <a href="/security/hall-of-fame/">Security Hall of Fame</a>.</p>
<h2 id="lessons-learned-from-self-hosting">Lessons learned from self-hosting</h2>
<p>Now that you&rsquo;re up to speed on our changes, I want to briefly reflect on our what we learned from self hosting, for the sake of transparency.</p>
<p>Initially, <a href="/blog/2023/05/04/introducing-the-grafana-labs-bug-bounty-program/">we thought self-hosting was the right choice</a>. We wanted full control from start to finish, allowing us to have generous response times, pay on triage, and build a strong security community. And there were a fair share of positives.</p>
<p>It was great to build those relationships, and the triage process also helped us understand our scope and products better. As security engineers, we have the best understanding of our products&rsquo; threat models. This insight helped us identify issues that initially seemed out of scope but could still provide significant security improvements for our products.</p>
<p>However, we ran into a number of issues that ultimately led us to make this change. For starters, there weren&rsquo;t any well-maintained open source bug bounty platforms, so we had to build a bunch of workarounds in GitHub to keep the program running as we scaled. We also spent most of our time triaging reports that were clearly out of scope or invalid, and we lacked the reach of a major bug bounty platform.</p>
<p>Moving the program to Intigriti will help us scale and improve the program going forward. If you have any questions regarding the bug bounty programs, feel free to join our public <a href="https://grafana.slack.com/archives/C078V3T4AA0" target="\_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Slack channel</a>.</p>

## Security Resources

With the ever prevalent threats that span todayâs landscape, NetApp continues
to derive and provide security solutions across the portfolio. Links to
security resources are found below. As always, stay tuned because just like the
threat landscape, these resources are ever changing and being updated!

#### Products and Solutions

The product and solutions resources provide guidance, recommendations, and best
practices with regard to security elements and configurations amongst the
NetApp portfolio.

##### ONTAP

[ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3846.pdf) - The
ONTAP 9 Security Datasheet provides a comprehensive list of security features
and functions available in ONTAP 9 - So if the question is, âwhat are all the
security features/functions in ONTAP 9?â, This is your resource!

[Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP
9](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4569.pdf) - We humbly refer to the
Security Hardening Guide for NetApp ONTAP 9 as your key resource when it comes
to answering the question, âhow do I deploy ONTAP 9 in the most secure
fashion?â. The hardening guide provides the recommended commands and configs
necessary to enable ONTAP 9 in the most secure configuration.

[ONTAP 9 Encryption Power
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Security_and_data_encryption.pdf)

* When it comes to understanding the configuration and management details of NSE and NVE,
  including deployment, certificates, onboard key management and more, the Power
  Guide is the key resource!

[ONTAP 9 Network Management
Guide](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/pdfs/sidebar/Network_management.pdf) - While
this guide provides vast elements surrounding ONTAP networking (IPv4, v6,
IPSpaces, and more), it also captures some key security elements such as
managing SVMs, protocol restrictions and firewall configuration in addition to
control plane elements such as DNS, SNMP, FIPS configuration, and MTU details.
The Network Management Guide also shows list of ports used in ONTAP, also
listed in the hardening guide.

[ONTAP 9 Manage administrator authentication and RBAC with the
CLI](https://docs.netapp.com/us-en/ontap/authentication/)

* You can enable login accounts for ONTAP cluster administrators and storage virtual machine (SVM) administrators.
  You can also use role-based access control (RBAC) to define the capabilities of administrators.

[NFS Kerberos in ONTAP](https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19384-tr-4616.pdf)

* How to configure NFS Kerberos support in ONTAP for Active Directory and Red Hat Enterprise Linux (RHEL) clients.

[How to configure LDAP in ONTAP Multiprotocol NAS identity
management](https://www.netapp.com/pdf.html?item=/media/19423-tr-4835.pdf)

* Lightweight Directory Access Protocol (LDAP) configuration as a method for UNIX identity
  management and name mapping for multiprotocol NAS access in ONTAP.

[DS-3898: NetApp Storage Encryption and NetApp Volume
Encryption](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3898.pdf) - When it comes to
encryption at rest there are many questions about the capabilities. The NSE and
NVE Datasheet seeks to quell such questions by providing a comprehensive
understanding of what NSE is, what NVE is, use cases, and how they can be
leveraged individually or together for a true dual/double encryption solution.

[NetApp Storage Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3213-en.pdf) - The NSE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NSE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NSE is, what we mean by self encrypting drives, or what
encryption algorithm is in use, this is the resource for you!

[NetApp Volume Encryption
Datasheet](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/ds-3899.pdf) - The NVE Datasheet
provides a holistic overview of the NVE solution and use cases. If you have
ever wondered what NVE is, or what encryption algorithm it uses, this is the
resource for you!

[ONTAP 9.x STIG](https://public.cyber.mil/stigs/downloads/?_dl_facet_stigs=network-other)

* Ver 1, Rel 1 of the NetApp ONTAP DSC 9.x STIG has been posted to the Security
  Technical Implementation Guides (STIGs) Document Library.

#### Threats

Threat resources consist of guidance to address known threats through a
combination of prevention, mitigation, and remediation.

##### Ransomware

[The NetApp Solution for
Ransomware](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4572.pdf) - Ransomware wages war
on every environment. Being the custodians of one of the worldâs most valuable
resources (data/information), itâs imperative that we protect it. When it comes
to ransomware, this is your guide to addressing and remediating the threat.

[NetApp and Varonis ransomware white
paper](https://info.varonis.com/hubfs/docs/whitepapers/en/Varonis-Ransomware-Whitepaper-Netapp.pdf) -
As a companion to the NetApp Solution for Ransomware, we have partnered with
Varonis in addressing the advanced techniques around this threat. We have
discussed and captured the solution in this joint white paper.

#### Integration and Solutions Guides

As we continue to tout the key elements of security including key management,
we understand the challenges and value of timeliness as it applies to adoption
and deployment. Due to such challenges we provide integration guides where we
walk through the configuration/provisioning of âkeyâ elements such as key
managers, FPolicy, and other security laden integration solutions.

##### Key Management

[NetApp ONTAP 9 External Key Management: Vormetric Key Management Integration
Guide](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4618.pdf) - The Vormetric integration
guide for ONTAP 9 depicts how to provision the Vormetric (Thales) key manager
for use with ONTAP 9.

##### FPolicy

[Cloud Insights with Cloud Secure](https://cloud.netapp.com/ci-sde-plp-cloud-secure-info-trial?hsCtaTracking=fefadff4-c195-4b6a-95e3-265d8ce7c0cd%7Cb696fdde-c026-4007-a39e-5e986c4d27c6)

[FPolicy Solution Guide for Clustered Data ONTAP: Varonis DatAdvantage](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4429.pdf)

[FPolicy Solution Guide for Clustered Data ONTAP: Veritas Data Insight](http://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4473.pdf)

##### Anti-Virus

[Antivirus Solution Guide for McAfee](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4286.pdf)

[Antivirus Solution Guide for Trend Micro](https://www.netapp.com/us/media/tr-4312.pdf)

#### Compliance

Compliance continues to evolve and shape the manner in which we address the
organizationâs of today and more importantly how we address securing the data.
Remember Security does not equal Compliance, but security does in fact aid in
addressing the challenge.

## Architected for scale

Built with modern distributed systems principles to grow with your applications and infrastructure. No artificial limits or barriers, just true horizontal scalability.

![Architected for scale]( "Architected for scale")![Architected for scale](/products/assets/ges/scale-diagram.svg "Architected for scale")

Architected for scale

* Achieve maximum potential observability since metric and log limits are no longer a barrier.
* Save money by not supporting the overhead of a monitoring infrastructure, both in resources and people time.
* Easily store application and infrastructure data in one centralized cluster, or across multiple clusters without needing a dedicated team.
## Simple, organization-wide administration and security

Confidently democratize data across your entire company with advanced admin tools to govern, audit, and secure user permissions and data.

![Simple, organization-wide administration & security](/media/products/assets/ges/security-diagram.svg)
##### Simple to manage

Not everyone needs access to the same data. Create flexible, secure views of relevant data for each team to optimize self-service, without additional overhead.

##### Simple to synchronize

Centralized authentication allows you to seamlessly integrate with your existing LDAP/Active Directory platform to allow a single point of control.

##### Simple to customize

Best-in-class query performance means you can quickly create real-time dashboards that can be shared throughout your organization.

##### Simple to secure

Export detailed user event logs to a file or to Enterprise Logs, in order to track and prevent suspicious activity.

## Services and support

Personalized training to help you maximize your usage of Grafana, Graphite, Prometheus, and Loki, led by the experts. Grafana Labs will help your teams establish best practices in instrumentation and deployment, as well as be an on-demand resource for ongoing questions.

#### Observability is our thing

## Correlate your data

Understanding all relevant data â and the relationships between them â is important. The Grafana Enterprise Stack allows teams to seamlessly correlate insights among metrics and logs.

![A side-by-side view makes it easier to correlate between logs and metrics from a single location.]( "A side-by-side view makes it easier to correlate between logs and metrics from a single location.")![A side-by-side view makes it easier to correlate between logs and metrics from a single location.](/media/products/assets/ges/correlate-dashboard.jpg "A side-by-side view makes it easier to correlate between logs and metrics from a single location.")

A side-by-side view makes it easier to correlate between logs and metrics from a single location.

* Easily correlate data to get to the root cause faster.
* Reduce mean time to recovery (MTTR) and de-risk feature launches.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

## Description

Today we are releasing Grafana 8.2.3. This patch release includes an important security fix for an issue that affects all Grafana versions from 8.0.0-beta1.

[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have already been patched and an audit did not find any usage of this attack vector. [Grafana Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise) customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.

## [CVE-2021-41174](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-3j9m-hcv9-rpj8 "CVE-2021-41174") XSS vulnerability on unauthenticated pages

### Summary

CVSS Score: 6.9 Medium

CVSS:[CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:R/CR:L/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:N/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:N/MI:H/MA:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:N/E:U/RL:O/RC:R/CR:L/MAV:N/MAC:H/MPR:N/MUI:R/MS:C/MC:N/MI:H/MA:L)

We received a security report to security@grafana.com on 2021-10-21 about a vulnerability in Grafana regarding the XSS vulnerability.

It was later identified as affecting Grafana versions from 8.0.0-beta1 to 8.2.2. [CVE-2021-41174](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41174) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

### Impact

If an attacker is able to convince a victim to visit a URL referencing a vulnerable page, arbitrary JavaScript content may be executed within the context of the victim's browser.

The user visiting the malicious link must be unauthenticated and the link must be for a page that contains the login button in the menu bar.

There are two ways an unauthenticated user can open a page in Grafana that contains the login button:

* Anonymous authentication is enabled. This means all pages in Grafana would be open for the attack.
* The link is to an unauthenticated page. The following pages are vulnerable:
  + `/dashboard-solo/snapshot/*`
  + `/dashboard/snapshot/*`
  + `/invite/:code`

The url has to be crafted to exploit AngularJS rendering and contain the interpolation binding for AngularJS expressions. AngularJS uses double curly braces for interpolation binding: {{ }}

An example of an expression would be: `{{constructor.constructor(‘alert(1)’)()}}`. This can be included in the link URL like this:

[https://play.grafana.org/dashboard/snapshot/%7B%7Bconstructor.constructor('alert(1)')()%7D%7D?orgId=1](https://play.grafana.org/dashboard/snapshot/%7B%7Bconstructor.constructor%28%27alert%281%29%27%29%28%29%7D%7D?orgId=1)

When the user follows the link and the page renders, the login button will contain the original link with a query parameter to force a redirect to the login page. The URL is not validated and the AngularJS rendering engine will execute the JavaScript expression contained in the URL.

### Attack audit

We can not guarantee that the below will identify all attacks, so if you find something using the audit process described below, you should consider doing a full assessment.

#### Through reverse proxy/load balancer logs

To determine if your Grafana installation has been exploited for this vulnerability, search through your reverse proxy/load balancer access logs for instances where the path contains `{{` followed by something that would invoke JavaScript code. For example, this could be code that attempts to show a fake login page or to steal browser or session data. The [OWASP cheat sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/XSS_Filter_Evasion_Cheat_Sheet.html) has several examples of XSS attacks.

#### Through the Grafana Enterprise audit feature

If you enabled “Log web requests” in your configuration with `router_logging = true`, look for requests where `path` contains `{{` followed by something that would invoke JavaScript code.

### Patched versions

Release 8.2.3:

* [Download Grafana 8.2.3](https://grafana.com/grafana/download/8.2.3)
* [Release notes](https://grafana.com/docs/grafana/latest/release-notes/release-notes-8-2-3/)

### Solutions and mitigations

Download and install the appropriate patch for your version of Grafana.

[Grafana Cloud](https://grafana.com/cloud) instances have already been patched, and [Grafana Enterprise](https://grafana.com/products/enterprise) customers were provided with updated binaries under embargo.

### Workaround

If for some reason you cannot upgrade, you can use a reverse proxy or similar to block access to block the literal string `{{` in the path.

Example of an Nginx rule to block the literal string `{{`:

```
location ~ \{\{ {
    deny all;
}

```

## [The GitHub Terms of Service](#the-github-terms-of-service)

Effective date: November 16, 2020

## [A. Definitions](#a-definitions)

**Short version:** *We use these basic terms throughout the agreement, and they have specific meanings. You should know what we mean when we use each of the terms. There's not going to be a test on it, but it's still useful information.*

1. An "Account" represents your legal relationship with GitHub. A “Personal Account” represents an individual User’s authorization to log in to and use the Service and serves as a User’s identity on GitHub. “Organizations” are shared workspaces that may be associated with a single entity or with one or more Users where multiple Users can collaborate across many projects at once. A Personal Account can be a member of any number of Organizations.
2. The “Agreement” refers, collectively, to all the terms, conditions, notices contained or referenced in this document (the “Terms of Service” or the "Terms") and all other operating rules, policies (including the GitHub Privacy Statement, available at [github.com/site/privacy](https://github.com/site/privacy)) and procedures that we may publish from time to time on the Website. Most of our site policies are available at [docs.github.com/categories/site-policy](/en/site-policy).
3. "Beta Previews" mean software, services, or features identified as alpha, beta, preview, early access, or evaluation, or words or phrases with similar meanings.
4. “Content” refers to content featured or displayed through the Website, including without limitation code, text, data, articles, images, photographs, graphics, software, applications, packages, designs, features, and other materials that are available on the Website or otherwise available through the Service. "Content" also includes Services. “User-Generated Content” is Content, written or otherwise, created or uploaded by our Users. "Your Content" is Content that you create or own.
5. “GitHub,” “We,” and “Us” refer to GitHub, Inc., as well as our affiliates, directors, subsidiaries, contractors, licensors, officers, agents, and employees.
6. The “Service” refers to the applications, software, products, and services provided by GitHub, including any Beta Previews.
7. “The User,” “You,” and “Your” refer to the individual person, company, or organization that has visited or is using the Website or Service; that accesses or uses any part of the Account; or that directs the use of the Account in the performance of its functions. A User must be at least 13 years of age. Special terms may apply for business or government Accounts (See [Section B(5): Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)).
8. The “Website” refers to GitHub’s website located at [github.com](https://github.com/), and all content, services, and products provided by GitHub at or through the Website. It also refers to GitHub-owned subdomains of github.com, such as [education.github.com](https://education.github.com/) and [pages.github.com](https://pages.github.com/). These Terms also govern GitHub’s conference websites, such as [githubuniverse.com](https://githubuniverse.com/), and product websites, such as [electronjs.org](https://www.electronjs.org/). Occasionally, websites owned by GitHub may provide different or additional terms of service. If those additional terms conflict with this Agreement, the more specific terms apply to the relevant page or service.

## [B. Account Terms](#b-account-terms)

**Short version:** *Personal Accounts and Organizations have different administrative controls; a human must create your Account; you must be 13 or over; you must provide a valid email address; and you may not have more than one free Account. You alone are responsible for your Account and anything that happens while you are signed in to or using your Account. You are responsible for keeping your Account secure.*

### [1. Account Controls](#1-account-controls)

* Users. Subject to these Terms, you retain ultimate administrative control over your Personal Account and the Content within it.
* Organizations. The "owner" of an Organization that was created under these Terms has ultimate administrative control over that Organization and the Content within it. Within the Service, an owner can manage User access to the Organization’s data and projects. An Organization may have multiple owners, but there must be at least one Personal Account designated as an owner of an Organization. If you are the owner of an Organization under these Terms, we consider you responsible for the actions that are performed on or through that Organization.

### [2. Required Information](#2-required-information)

You must provide a valid email address in order to complete the signup process. Any other information requested, such as your real name, is optional, unless you are accepting these terms on behalf of a legal entity (in which case we need more information about the legal entity) or if you opt for a [paid Account](#k-payment), in which case additional information will be necessary for billing purposes.

### [3. Account Requirements](#3-account-requirements)

We have a few simple rules for Personal Accounts on GitHub's Service.

* You must be a human to create an Account. Accounts registered by "bots" or other automated methods are not permitted. We do permit machine accounts:
* A machine account is an Account set up by an individual human who accepts the Terms on behalf of the Account, provides a valid email address, and is responsible for its actions. A machine account is used exclusively for performing automated tasks. Multiple users may direct the actions of a machine account, but the owner of the Account is ultimately responsible for the machine's actions. You may maintain no more than one free machine account in addition to your free Personal Account.
* One person or legal entity may maintain no more than one free Account (if you choose to control a machine account as well, that's fine, but it can only be used for running a machine).
* You must be age 13 or older. While we are thrilled to see brilliant young coders get excited by learning to program, we must comply with United States law. GitHub does not target our Service to children under 13, and we do not permit any Users under 13 on our Service. If we learn of any User under the age of 13, we will [terminate that User’s Account immediately](#l-cancellation-and-termination). If you are a resident of a country outside the United States, your country’s minimum age may be older; in such a case, you are responsible for complying with your country’s laws.
* Your login may only be used by one person — i.e., a single login may not be shared by multiple people. A paid Organization may only provide access to as many Personal Accounts as your subscription allows.
* You may not use GitHub in violation of export control or sanctions laws of the United States or any other applicable jurisdiction. You may not use GitHub if you are or are working on behalf of a [Specially Designated National (SDN)](https://www.treasury.gov/resource-center/sanctions/SDN-List/Pages/default.aspx) or a person subject to similar blocking or denied party prohibitions administered by a U.S. government agency. GitHub may allow persons in certain sanctioned countries or territories to access certain GitHub services pursuant to U.S. government authorizations. For more information, please see our [Export Controls policy](/en/site-policy/other-site-policies/github-and-trade-controls).

### [4. Account Security](#4-account-security)

You are responsible for keeping your Account secure while you use our Service. We offer tools such as two-factor authentication to help you maintain your Account's security, but the content of your Account and its security are up to you.

* You are responsible for all content posted and activity that occurs under your Account (even when content is posted by others who have Accounts under your Account).
* You are responsible for maintaining the security of your Account and password. GitHub cannot and will not be liable for any loss or damage from your failure to comply with this security obligation.
* You will promptly notify GitHub by contacting us through the [GitHub Support portal](https://support.github.com/) if you become aware of any unauthorized use of, or access to, our Service through your Account, including any unauthorized use of your password or Account.

### [5. Additional Terms](#5-additional-terms)

In some situations, third parties' terms may apply to your use of GitHub. For example, you may be a member of an organization on GitHub with its own terms or license agreements; you may download an application that integrates with GitHub; or you may use GitHub to authenticate to another service. Please be aware that while these Terms are our full agreement with you, other parties' terms govern their relationships with you.

If you are a government User or otherwise accessing or using any GitHub Service in a government capacity, this [Government Amendment to GitHub Terms of Service](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/amendment-to-github-terms-of-service-applicable-to-us-federal-government-users) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

If you have signed up for GitHub Enterprise Cloud, the [Enterprise Cloud Addendum](/en/site-policy/site-policy-deprecated/github-enterprise-service-level-agreement) applies to you, and you agree to its provisions.

## [C. Acceptable Use](#c-acceptable-use)

**Short version:** *GitHub hosts a wide variety of collaborative projects from all over the world, and that collaboration only works when our users are able to work together in good faith. While using the service, you must follow the terms of this section, which include some restrictions on content you can post, conduct on the service, and other limitations. In short, be excellent to each other.*

Your use of the Website and Service must not violate any applicable laws, including copyright or trademark laws, export control or sanctions laws, or other laws in your jurisdiction. You are responsible for making sure that your use of the Service is in compliance with laws and any applicable regulations.

You agree that you will not under any circumstances violate our [Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies) or [Community Guidelines](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-community-guidelines).

## [D. User-Generated Content](#d-user-generated-content)

**Short version:** *You own content you create, but you allow us certain rights to it, so that we can display and share the content you post. You still have control over your content, and responsibility for it, and the rights you grant us are limited to those we need to provide the service. We have the right to remove content or close Accounts if we need to.*

### [1. Responsibility for User-Generated Content](#1-responsibility-for-user-generated-content)

You may create or upload User-Generated Content while using the Service. You are solely responsible for the content of, and for any harm resulting from, any User-Generated Content that you post, upload, link to or otherwise make available via the Service, regardless of the form of that Content. We are not responsible for any public display or misuse of your User-Generated Content.

### [2. GitHub May Remove Content](#2-github-may-remove-content)

We have the right to refuse or remove any User-Generated Content that, in our sole discretion, violates any laws or [GitHub terms or policies](/en/site-policy). User-Generated Content displayed on GitHub Mobile may be subject to mobile app stores' additional terms.

### [3. Ownership of Content, Right to Post, and License Grants](#3-ownership-of-content-right-to-post-and-license-grants)

You retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content. If you're posting anything you did not create yourself or do not own the rights to, you agree that you are responsible for any Content you post; that you will only submit Content that you have the right to post; and that you will fully comply with any third party licenses relating to Content you post.

Because you retain ownership of and responsibility for Your Content, we need you to grant us — and other GitHub Users — certain legal permissions, listed in Sections D.4 — D.7. These license grants apply to Your Content. If you upload Content that already comes with a license granting GitHub the permissions we need to run our Service, no additional license is required. You understand that you will not receive any payment for any of the rights granted in Sections D.4 — D.7. The licenses you grant to us will end when you remove Your Content from our servers, unless other Users have forked it.

### [4. License Grant to Us](#4-license-grant-to-us)

We need the legal right to do things like host Your Content, publish it, and share it. You grant us and our legal successors the right to store, archive, parse, and display Your Content, and make incidental copies, as necessary to provide the Service, including improving the Service over time. This license includes the right to do things like copy it to our database and make backups; show it to you and other users; parse it into a search index or otherwise analyze it on our servers; share it with other users; and perform it, in case Your Content is something like music or video.

This license does not grant GitHub the right to sell Your Content. It also does not grant GitHub the right to otherwise distribute or use Your Content outside of our provision of the Service, except that as part of the right to archive Your Content, GitHub may permit our partners to store and archive Your Content in public repositories in connection with the [GitHub Arctic Code Vault and GitHub Archive Program](https://archiveprogram.github.com/).

### [5. License Grant to Other Users](#5-license-grant-to-other-users)

Any User-Generated Content you post publicly, including issues, comments, and contributions to other Users' repositories, may be viewed by others. By setting your repositories to be viewed publicly, you agree to allow others to view and "fork" your repositories (this means that others may make their own copies of Content from your repositories in repositories they control).

If you set your pages and repositories to be viewed publicly, you grant each User of GitHub a nonexclusive, worldwide license to use, display, and perform Your Content through the GitHub Service and to reproduce Your Content solely on GitHub as permitted through GitHub's functionality (for example, through forking). You may grant further rights if you [adopt a license](/en/communities/setting-up-your-project-for-healthy-contributions/adding-a-license-to-a-repository#including-an-open-source-license-in-your-repository). If you are uploading Content you did not create or own, you are responsible for ensuring that the Content you upload is licensed under terms that grant these permissions to other GitHub Users.

### [6. Contributions Under Repository License](#6-contributions-under-repository-license)

Whenever you add Content to a repository containing notice of a license, you license that Content under the same terms, and you agree that you have the right to license that Content under those terms. If you have a separate agreement to license that Content under different terms, such as a contributor license agreement, that agreement will supersede.

Isn't this just how it works already? Yep. This is widely accepted as the norm in the open-source community; it's commonly referred to by the shorthand "inbound=outbound". We're just making it explicit.

### [7. Moral Rights](#7-moral-rights)

You retain all moral rights to Your Content that you upload, publish, or submit to any part of the Service, including the rights of integrity and attribution. However, you waive these rights and agree not to assert them against us, to enable us to reasonably exercise the rights granted in Section D.4, but not otherwise.

To the extent this agreement is not enforceable by applicable law, you grant GitHub the rights we need to use Your Content without attribution and to make reasonable adaptations of Your Content as necessary to render the Website and provide the Service.

## [E. Private Repositories](#e-private-repositories)

**Short version:** *We treat the content of private repositories as confidential, and we only access it as described in our Privacy Statement—for security purposes, to assist the repository owner with a support matter, to maintain the integrity of the Service, to comply with our legal obligations, if we have reason to believe the contents are in violation of the law, or with your consent.*

### [1. Control of Private Repositories](#1-control-of-private-repositories)

Some Accounts may have private repositories, which allow the User to control access to Content.

### [2. Confidentiality of Private Repositories](#2-confidentiality-of-private-repositories)

GitHub considers the contents of private repositories to be confidential to you. GitHub will protect the contents of private repositories from unauthorized use, access, or disclosure in the same manner that we would use to protect our own confidential information of a similar nature and in no event with less than a reasonable degree of care.

### [3. Access](#3-access)

GitHub personnel may only access the content of your private repositories in the situations described in our [Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#repository-contents).

You may choose to enable additional access to your private repositories. For example:

* You may enable various GitHub services or features that require additional rights to Your Content in private repositories. These rights may vary depending on the service or feature, but GitHub will continue to treat your private repository Content as confidential. If those services or features require rights in addition to those we need to provide the GitHub Service, we will provide an explanation of those rights.

Additionally, we may be [compelled by law](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure) to disclose the contents of your private repositories.

GitHub will provide notice regarding our access to private repository content, unless [for legal disclosure](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement#for-legal-disclosure), to comply with our legal obligations, or where otherwise bound by requirements under law, for automated scanning, or if in response to a security threat or other risk to security.

## [H. API Terms](#h-api-terms)

**Short version:** *You agree to these Terms of Service, plus this Section H, when using any of GitHub's APIs (Application Provider Interface), including use of the API through a third party product that accesses GitHub.*

Abuse or excessively frequent requests to GitHub via the API may result in the temporary or permanent suspension of your Account's access to the API. GitHub, in our sole discretion, will determine abuse or excessive usage of the API. We will make a reasonable attempt to warn you via email prior to suspension.

You may not share API tokens to exceed GitHub's rate limitations.

You may not use the API to download data or Content from GitHub for spamming purposes, including for the purposes of selling GitHub users' personal information, such as to recruiters, headhunters, and job boards.

All use of the GitHub API is subject to these Terms of Service and the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://github.com/site/privacy).

GitHub may offer subscription-based access to our API for those Users who require high-throughput access or access that would result in resale of GitHub's Service.

## [I. GitHub Additional Product Terms](#i-github-additional-product-terms)

**Short version:** *You need to follow certain specific terms and conditions for GitHub's various features and products, and you agree to the Supplemental Terms and Conditions when you agree to this Agreement.*

## [J. Beta Previews](#j-beta-previews)

**Short version:** *Beta Previews may not be supported or may change at any time. You may receive confidential information through those programs that must remain confidential while the program is private. We'd love your feedback to make our Beta Previews better.*

### [1. Subject to Change](#1-subject-to-change)

Beta Previews may not be supported and may be changed at any time without notice. In addition, Beta Previews are not subject to the same security measures and auditing to which the Service has been and is subject. **By using a Beta Preview, you use it at your own risk.**

### [2. Confidentiality](#2-confidentiality)

As a user of Beta Previews, you may get access to special information that isn’t available to the rest of the world. Due to the sensitive nature of this information, it’s important for us to make sure that you keep that information secret.

**Confidentiality Obligations.** You agree that any non-public Beta Preview information we give you, such as information about a private Beta Preview, will be considered GitHub’s confidential information (collectively, “Confidential Information”), regardless of whether it is marked or identified as such. You agree to only use such Confidential Information for the express purpose of testing and evaluating the Beta Preview (the “Purpose”), and not for any other purpose. You should use the same degree of care as you would with your own confidential information, but no less than reasonable precautions to prevent any unauthorized use, disclosure, publication, or dissemination of our Confidential Information. You promise not to disclose, publish, or disseminate any Confidential Information to any third party, unless we don’t otherwise prohibit or restrict such disclosure (for example, you might be part of a GitHub-organized group discussion about a private Beta Preview feature).

**Exceptions.** Confidential Information will not include information that is: (a) or becomes publicly available without breach of this Agreement through no act or inaction on your part (such as when a private Beta Preview becomes a public Beta Preview); (b) known to you before we disclose it to you; (c) independently developed by you without breach of any confidentiality obligation to us or any third party; or (d) disclosed with permission from GitHub. You will not violate the terms of this Agreement if you are required to disclose Confidential Information pursuant to operation of law, provided GitHub has been given reasonable advance written notice to object, unless prohibited by law.

### [3. Feedback](#3-feedback)

We’re always trying to improve of products and services, and your feedback as a Beta Preview user will help us do that. If you choose to give us any ideas, know-how, algorithms, code contributions, suggestions, enhancement requests, recommendations or any other feedback for our products or services (collectively, “Feedback”), you acknowledge and agree that GitHub will have a royalty-free, fully paid-up, worldwide, transferable, sub-licensable, irrevocable and perpetual license to implement, use, modify, commercially exploit and/or incorporate the Feedback into our products, services, and documentation.

## [K. Payment](#k-payment)

### [1. Pricing](#1-pricing)

Our pricing and payment terms are available at [github.com/pricing](https://github.com/pricing). If you agree to a subscription price, that will remain your price for the duration of the payment term; however, prices are subject to change at the end of a payment term.

### [2. Upgrades, Downgrades, and Changes](#2-upgrades-downgrades-and-changes)

* We will immediately bill you when you upgrade from the free plan to any paying plan.
* If you change from a monthly billing plan to a yearly billing plan, GitHub will bill you for a full year at the next monthly billing date.
* If you upgrade to a higher level of service, we will bill you for the upgraded plan immediately.
* You may change your level of service at any time by [choosing a plan option](https://github.com/pricing) or going into your [Billing settings](https://github.com/settings/billing). If you choose to downgrade your Account, you may lose access to Content, features, or capacity of your Account. Please see our section on [Cancellation](#l-cancellation-and-termination) for information on getting a copy of that Content.

### [3. Billing Schedule; No Refunds](#3-billing-schedule-no-refunds)

**Payment Based on Plan** For monthly or yearly payment plans, the Service is billed in advance on a monthly or yearly basis respectively and is non-refundable. There will be no refunds or credits for partial months of service, downgrade refunds, or refunds for months unused with an open Account; however, the service will remain active for the length of the paid billing period. In order to treat everyone equally, no exceptions will be made.

**Payment Based on Usage** Some Service features are billed based on your usage. A limited quantity of these Service features may be included in your plan for a limited term without additional charge. If you choose to use paid Service features beyond the quantity included in your plan, you pay for those Service features based on your actual usage in the preceding month. Monthly payment for these purchases will be charged on a periodic basis in arrears. See [GitHub Additional Product Terms for Details](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-for-additional-products-and-features).

**Invoicing** For invoiced Users, User agrees to pay the fees in full, up front without deduction or setoff of any kind, in U.S. Dollars. User must pay the fees within thirty (30) days of the GitHub invoice date. Amounts payable under this Agreement are non-refundable, except as otherwise provided in this Agreement. If User fails to pay any fees on time, GitHub reserves the right, in addition to taking any other action at law or equity, to (i) charge interest on past due amounts at 1.0% per month or the highest interest rate allowed by law, whichever is less, and to charge all expenses of recovery, and (ii) terminate the applicable order form. User is solely responsible for all taxes, fees, duties and governmental assessments (except for taxes based on GitHub's net income) that are imposed or become due in connection with this Agreement.

### [4. Authorization](#4-authorization)

The Account screen provides a simple, no questions asked cancellation link. We are not able to cancel Accounts in response to an email or phone request.

### [2. Upon Cancellation](#2-upon-cancellation)

We will retain and use your information as necessary to comply with our legal obligations, resolve disputes, and enforce our agreements, but barring legal requirements, we will delete your full profile and the Content of your repositories within 90 days of cancellation or termination (though some information may remain in encrypted backups). This information cannot be recovered once your Account is canceled.

We will not delete Content that you have contributed to other Users' repositories or that other Users have forked.

Upon request, we will make a reasonable effort to provide an Account owner with a copy of your lawful, non-infringing Account contents after Account cancellation, termination, or downgrade. You must make this request within 90 days of cancellation, termination, or downgrade.

### [3. GitHub May Terminate](#3-github-may-terminate)

This section does not affect your non-waivable rights.

### [2. Legal Notice to GitHub Must Be in Writing](#2-legal-notice-to-github-must-be-in-writing)

You agree to indemnify us, defend us, and hold us harmless from and against any and all claims, liabilities, and expenses, including attorneys’ fees, arising out of your use of the Website and the Service, including but not limited to your violation of this Agreement, provided that GitHub (1) promptly gives you written notice of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding; (2) gives you sole control of the defense and settlement of the claim, demand, suit or proceeding (provided that you may not settle any claim, demand, suit or proceeding unless the settlement unconditionally releases GitHub of all liability); and (3) provides to you all reasonable assistance, at your expense.

## [Q. Changes to These Terms](#q-changes-to-these-terms)

**Short version:** *We want our users to be informed of important changes to our terms, but some changes aren't that important — we don't want to bother you every time we fix a typo. So while we may modify this agreement at any time, we will notify users of any material changes and give you time to adjust to them.*

We reserve the right, at our sole discretion, to amend these Terms of Service at any time and will update these Terms of Service in the event of any such amendments.

Grafana allows you to query, visualize, alert on and understand your metrics no matter where they are stored. Create, explore, and share dashboards with your team and foster a data-driven culture:

* **Visualizations:** Fast and flexible client side graphs with a multitude of options. Panel plugins offer many different ways to visualize metrics and logs.
* **Dynamic Dashboards:** Create dynamic & reusable dashboards with template variables that appear as dropdowns at the top of the dashboard.
* **Explore Metrics:** Explore your data through ad-hoc queries and dynamic drilldown. Split view and compare different time ranges, queries and data sources side by side.
* **Explore Logs:** Experience the magic of switching from metrics to logs with preserved label filters. Quickly search through all your logs or streaming them live.
* **Alerting:** Visually define alert rules for your most important metrics. Grafana will continuously evaluate and send notifications to systems like Slack, PagerDuty, VictorOps, OpsGenie.
* **Mixed Data Sources:** Mix different data sources in the same graph! You can specify a data source on a per-query basis. This works for even custom datasources.
