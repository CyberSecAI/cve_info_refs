{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The shape inference code for `tf.ragged.cross` has an undefined behavior due to binding a reference to `nullptr`.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "A reference is bound to a `nullptr` during shape inference in `tf.ragged.cross`.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Results in a crash due to undefined behavior.",
  "Attack vectors": "Calling the `tf.ragged.cross` function with specific invalid inputs.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to provide the specific invalid inputs to the `tf.ragged.cross` function."
