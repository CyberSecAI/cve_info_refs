Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41209:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the convolution operator implementations in TensorFlow. Specifically, when an empty filter tensor is passed as an argument, it leads to a division by zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Division by zero error within the convolution operation logic when handling empty filter tensors.
- Lack of input validation/sanitization for filter tensors, not considering cases of zero-sized dimensions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A floating-point exception (FPE) is triggered, leading to a crash of the program/application utilizing the affected TensorFlow operations.
- Potential denial-of-service if exploited repeatedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Passing a crafted input with an empty (zero-sized) filter tensor argument to the affected convolution operations.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to control the input of the affected convolution operations, enabling them to provide an empty filter tensor. This could be through a malicious input file, a crafted network request, or other means depending on the application's context.
- No specific capabilities beyond this are mentioned in the advisory.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by adding validation checks to prevent the division by zero from happening with empty filter tensors.
- The fix was incorporated in TensorFlow versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1, and the upcoming 2.7.0.
- The commit that patches the vulnerability is [f2c3931113eaafe9ef558faaddd48e00a6606235](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f2c3931113eaafe9ef558faaddd48e00a6606235).
- The vulnerability has been classified as having a "Low" severity.
