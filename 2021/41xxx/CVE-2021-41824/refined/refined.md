Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41824:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way Craft CMS handles data exports in CSV format, where it does not properly sanitize user-provided input. This can result in formula injection when the CSV file is opened in certain versions of spreadsheet software (e.g., old versions of Excel).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSV Injection (also known as Formula Injection): The software does not sanitize user inputs properly when exporting to CSV files. This enables an attacker to insert malicious formulas into cells, which could be executed by the spreadsheet software when the file is opened.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- When a user opens a crafted CSV file in a vulnerable spreadsheet application, the injected formulas may be executed. Depending on the spreadsheet software capabilities and the specific formula injected, this could lead to a variety of malicious outcomes, including:
    -  Data exfiltration: Formulas can potentially retrieve data from other parts of the spreadsheet or even external sources.
    -  Command execution: Some spreadsheet applications support the execution of arbitrary commands via certain formulas.
    -  Credential theft: An attacker might try to trick a user to enable macros, which could then be used for further malicious activities.
    -  System compromise: If the system is not secured, attackers may be able to write files and even gain initial access.

**Attack vectors:**
- User-provided data: The attacker injects malicious formulas via user inputs submitted to the Craft CMS application. This data is then included in the generated CSV file.
- CSV export functionality: The vulnerable component is the CSV export feature of Craft CMS, especially when user data is included.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the Craft CMS application that will be included in the CSV export. This could be through any user-accessible input field.
- The attacker would require the victim to open the exported CSV file using a vulnerable application (such as older version of Excel).

**Additional Information:**
- This vulnerability was addressed in Craft CMS version 3.7.14.
- The vulnerability is rated as **Low** severity by the maintainers.
- The fix addresses this vulnerability by properly sanitizing user input in CSV exports, thereby preventing formula injection.
