Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The Patient Appointment Scheduler System (PASS-PHP) v1.0, developed by oretnom23, has a SQL injection vulnerability in the `login.php` file. Specifically, the `username` and `password` parameters are susceptible.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `username` and `password` parameters in `login.php`. This allows an attacker to bypass authentication.
*   **Stored XSS:** After successfully logging in as an administrator (through the SQL injection), an attacker can inject a malicious XSS payload that will be stored in the system.
*   **PHPSESSID Hijacking:** The stored XSS payload can be used to hijack the active `PHPSESSID` of the administrator every time they log into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the login authentication by exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Admin Account Compromise:** Successful authentication bypass allows access to the admin account.
*   **PHPSESSID Hijacking:** Through the stored XSS payload, the attacker can steal the administrator's session ID, gaining full access to their session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely via the web interface.
*   **SQL Injection via Login Form:** The attacker crafts malicious SQL queries through the `username` and `password` fields in the `login.php` file.
*   **Stored XSS Injection:** After logging in as an admin, the attacker injects XSS payload.
*   **PHPSESSID Theft:** The attacker uses the stored XSS to steal administrator session ID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the application.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be familiar with SQL injection and XSS concepts.
*   **Ability to send HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the application.
*   **Ability to Log into admin panel after SQL Injection**

**Summary of findings compared to CVE description:**
The provided content gives more specific information than a typical CVE description, detailing the vulnerable files (`login.php`), parameters (`username` and `password`), and the steps involved in exploiting the vulnerability. It also includes a link to a video PoC, and explains the XSS and session hijacking implications, which are not always present in the base CVE.
