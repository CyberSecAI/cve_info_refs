Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of SVG files uploaded as user avatars in Zenario CMS. The CMS allows the upload of SVG files, which can contain malicious JavaScript code that gets executed when the SVG is rendered.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability through SVG file upload.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account takeover:** Attackers can steal victim's cookies, leading to account takeover.
- **Malicious actions:** By injecting JavaScript code, attackers can perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially leading to data breaches or further compromise.
- **User compromise:** The vulnerability affects any user viewing the malicious SVG image (e.g., avatar of the contact).

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a malicious SVG file as an image, specifically as user's contact/avatar image.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Zenario CMS administration panel with the ability to upload images.
- Ability to manipulate HTTP requests via tools such as Burp Suite to upload SVG with malicious code.
