# Heap OOB in `SparseBinCount`

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-374m-jm66-3vj8
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e71b86d47f8bc1816bf54d7bddc4170e47670b97/tensorflow/core/kernels/bincount_op.cc#L353-L417) of `SparseBinCount` is vulnerable to a heap OOB:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.SparseBincount(
  indices=[[0],[1],[2]]
  values=[0,-10000000]
  dense_shape=[1,1]
  size=[1]
  weights=[3,2,1]
  binary_output=False)
```

This is because of missing validation between the elements of the `values` argument and the shape of the sparse output:

```
for (int64_t i = 0; i < indices_mat.dimension(0); ++i) {
  const int64_t batch = indices_mat(i, 0);
  const Tidx bin = values(i);
  ...
  out(batch, bin) = ...;
}
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f410212e373eb2aec4c9e60bf3702eba99a38aba](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f410212e373eb2aec4c9e60bf3702eba99a38aba).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41226

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
