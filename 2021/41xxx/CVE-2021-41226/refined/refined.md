The provided content is related to CVE-2021-41226.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `SparseBinCount` implementation in TensorFlow lacks validation between the elements of the `values` argument and the shape of the sparse output. Specifically, the code iterates through the `indices` and `values` to update the output tensor. However, it does not properly check if the `bin` values (obtained from `values`) are within the bounds of the output tensor, leading to an out-of-bounds write.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the `SparseBinCount` operation.
- Missing input validation for the `values` argument against the output tensor dimensions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can cause a heap out-of-bounds write.
- This can lead to denial of service (crashes) or potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by crafting a malicious input to the `SparseBinCount` operation.
- The attacker needs to control the `values` argument to `SparseBinCount` with out-of-bounds values relative to the `dense_shape`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to a TensorFlow model that utilizes `SparseBinCount` operation. This means an attacker would need to control or influence the input data that eventually reaches the vulnerable operation
- No specific position or level of access is explicitly mentioned other than the ability to influence the input data.

**Additional details:**
The provided commit (`f410212e373eb2aec4c9e60bf3702eba99a38aba`) introduces checks to validate if `batch` and `bin` values are within the bounds of the output tensor dimensions.
```c++
OP_REQUIRES(
  ctx, batch < out.dimension(0),
  errors::InvalidArgument("Index out of bound. `batch` (", batch,
                          ") must be less than the dimension size (",
                          out.dimension(0), ")."));
OP_REQUIRES(
  ctx, bin < out.dimension(1),
  errors::InvalidArgument("Index out ouf bound. `bin` (", bin,
                          ") must be less then the dimension size (",
                          out.dimension(1), ")."));
```
This commit effectively mitigates the heap out-of-bounds vulnerability.
