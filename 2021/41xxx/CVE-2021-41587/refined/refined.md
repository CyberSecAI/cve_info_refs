- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An unadvertised HTTP endpoint accessible only from the server side, which exposes private application configuration information including secrets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability allows an attacker to access the internal endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can obtain application secrets, including credentials to connect to other systems like the database.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting an existing SSRF vulnerability within the application to access the internal HTTP endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have the ability to perform Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) and know the unadvertised address of the internal HTTP endpoint.
