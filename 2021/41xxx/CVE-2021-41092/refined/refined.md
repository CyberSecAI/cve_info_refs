  "CVE-2021-41092": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability was found in the Docker CLI where running `docker login my-private-registry.example.com` with a misconfigured configuration file (typically `~/.docker/config.json`) listing a `credsStore` or `credHelpers` that could not be executed would result in any provided credentials being sent to `registry-1.docker.io` rather than the intended private registry.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Misconfiguration in the Docker CLI when handling `credsStore` or `credHelpers` leading to credentials being sent to the wrong registry.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor"
    ],
    "Impact": "Exposure of private registry credentials to an unauthorized registry (registry-1.docker.io).",
    "Attack vectors": "Running `docker login` with a private registry and a misconfigured `config.json` file with a non-executable credential helper.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to have the user run `docker login` with a specific private registry and have a misconfigured `config.json` file. User interaction is required."
