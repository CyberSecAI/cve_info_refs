- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious script code into the "Owner fullname" parameter.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they view the service requests. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:**
    1.  The attacker navigates to the service request page.
    2.  The attacker enters a malicious payload (e.g., `<script>alert(1)</script>`) in the "Owner fullname" field.
    3.  The attacker submits the request.
    4.  When an administrator views the service request in the admin panel, the stored XSS payload is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access the service request form and input data. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
