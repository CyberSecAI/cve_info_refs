Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of hardcoded passwords and keys within the Zoho Remote Access Plus (RAP) application. Specifically, a database connection string password was hardcoded.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The application uses hardcoded credentials for accessing the database. This makes it possible for an attacker to gain access to sensitive data.
*   **Hardcoded Salt Value:** A weak, fixed salt value is used in the `resetPWD.xml` file, which can be exploited in password reset attempts.
*   **Improper file permission:** It was also noted that the product was vulnerable to improper file permissions, which made it possible for anyone to read the `resetPWD.xml` file containing the fixed password and salt.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Sensitive Data:** An attacker can gain access to the database containing critical information, including:
    *   Server configurations
    *   Deployed agent configurations
    *   Enterprise system and user details
    *   System information
    *   Vulnerability and patch status
    *   User accounts
    *   Keys
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** While the hardcoded database user had view-only permissions, unauthorized access to this data could lead to further attacks by using the information gained.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Reverse Engineering:** The hardcoded credentials can be discovered by reverse engineering the application's code, specifically within the `DCBackupRestore.jar` file, which can be opened with tools like JDGui.
*   **File System Access:** Due to improper file permissions, access to the `resetPWD.xml` file could be obtained.
*  **Internet Availability**: The application is easily downloadable over the internet, making it easy for attackers to obtain the application for reverse engineering.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Reverse Engineer Java Code:**  Attackers need the ability to reverse engineer Java code to extract the hardcoded credentials from the JAR file.
*   **Access to the Application:** The application can be downloaded easily, allowing anyone to access the files required for exploitation.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as medium severity (CVSS score of 5.5).
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 10.1.2121.1 of Remote Access Plus.
*  The database was configured to listen internally by default but there is a provision to have it listen on all interfaces as well.
* Although the hardcoded user had read-only access, the information obtained could still be used to carry out further attacks.
