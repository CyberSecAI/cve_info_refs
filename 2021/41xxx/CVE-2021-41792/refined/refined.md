Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-41792:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue.
- It is triggered through a specific document format transformation within Alfresco Content Services.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Blind SSRF:** The server makes a request to a URL controlled (at least partially) by the attacker. The response to this request is not directly returned to the attacker.
- **Document Format Transformation:**  A specific transformation process of a document allows for the SSRF.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially make the server initiate requests to internal or external resources.
- This could potentially be leveraged to scan internal networks, access internal resources or other actions depending on the network configuration.
- The specific impact depends on the network architecture of the vulnerable server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the document transformation functionality of Alfresco.
- An attacker needs to craft a document that, when processed by the vulnerable server, triggers the transformation process that leads to the SSRF.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to upload a crafted document to a vulnerable Alfresco instance or to trick a user to upload it.
- No other specific capabilities are mentioned, but it can be assumed that access to the application interface is required.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by disabling the specific document transformation through configuration in Alfresco.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Alfresco Content Services and Alfresco Transform Services.
- The vulnerability was assigned the provisional number CVE-2021-41792.
