| Description In CMS\_Conservative\_init, w is received from Python code. Its size is not validated hence "self->table[i] = (CMS\_CELL\_TYPE \*) calloc(self->width, sizeof(CMS\_CELL\_TYPE));" may fail , which cause the Null pointer. self->table[i] would be accessed in CMS\_Conservative\_increment\_obj, which make the Python crash down. Steps/Code/Corpus to Reproduce ``` static int CMS_VARIANT(_init)(CMS_TYPE *self, PyObject *args, PyObject *kwds) {     .........................     for (i = 0; i < self->depth; i++)     {         self->table[i] = (CMS_CELL_TYPE *) calloc(self->width, sizeof(CMS_CELL_TYPE));         printf ("[%d]self->table[%d] = %p \r\n", i, i, self->table[i]);     }     ...........................  ```  **Optional call-path**: increment -> CMS\_Log1024\_increment -> CMS\_Conservative\_increment\_obj Expected Results when w is set as an arbitrary number, Python can not crash down. Actual Results crash Versions the main branch |
