Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41201:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation` function in TensorFlow. This function is responsible for parsing the equation used in the einsum operation and determining if ellipsis are present in inputs and outputs. The issue is that the function only sets flags indicating the presence of an ellipsis to `true`, but it does not explicitly set them to `false` when an ellipsis is not present. This leads to uninitialized access if the calling code expects these flags to always be set to a valid boolean value (true or false).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uninitialized Variable Access:** The primary weakness is the potential for reading uninitialized memory when the `input_has_ellipsis` vector and `output_has_ellipsis` variables are accessed without being initialized when no ellipsis is present. This occurs because the code only sets these flags to `true` when ellipsis is detected but does not handle the `false` case, which is the default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Undefined Behavior:** The impact is that accessing uninitialized variables in the `input_has_ellipsis` vector or `output_has_ellipsis` boolean could cause unpredictable behavior in the program. This might lead to incorrect results, crashes, or other issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted Einsum Operation:** The vulnerability is triggered when the user supplies an einsum operation that does not contain ellipsis. This input to the `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation` function causes the variables not to be properly initialized.
- **Indirect exploitation via TensorFlow:**  This is not a direct attack vector, but if an attacker could influence a tensorflow program to supply such an input, the vulnerability could be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to influence Einsum operation:** The attacker needs the ability to control or influence the input to the `einsum` operation in tensorflow, specifically the equation passed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code diff shows the fix involves initializing the `input_has_ellipsis` and `output_has_ellipsis` variables to `false` before processing the input and output labels. This change ensures that these variables always have a defined boolean value, preventing the uninitialized access.
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions before 2.7.0 and has been patched in versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2 and 2.6.1.
- The Github Security Advisory (GHSA-j86v-p27c-73fm) confirms this information and assigns a "Moderate" severity.
