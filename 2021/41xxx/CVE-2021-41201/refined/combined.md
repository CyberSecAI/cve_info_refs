Fix EinsumHelper::ParseEquation to avoid uninitialized accesses.

```
EinsumHelper::ParseEquation is supposed to return true or false in
input_has_ellipsis and output_has_ellipsis to indicate whether there is
ellipsis in the inputs and output. Previously, when there is no ellipsis in the
inputs or output, the routine doesn't assign false to the variables. This
change initializes the two variables with false to fix the problem.

# Unitialized access in `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation`

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-j86v-p27c-73fm
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

During execution, [`EinsumHelper::ParseEquation()`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e0b6e58c328059829c3eb968136f17aa72b6c876/tensorflow/core/kernels/linalg/einsum_op_impl.h#L126-L181) is supposed to set the flags in `input_has_ellipsis` vector and `*output_has_ellipsis` boolean to indicate whether there is ellipsis in the corresponding inputs and output.

However, the code only changes these flags to `true` and never assigns `false`.

```
for (int i = 0; i < num_inputs; ++i) {
  input_label_counts->at(i).resize(num_labels);
  for (const int label : input_labels->at(i)) {
    if (label != kEllipsisLabel)
      input_label_counts->at(i)[label] += 1;
    else
      input_has_ellipsis->at(i) = true;
  }
}
output_label_counts->resize(num_labels);
for (const int label : *output_labels) {
  if (label != kEllipsisLabel)
    output_label_counts->at(label) += 1;
  else
    *output_has_ellipsis = true;
}
```

This results in unitialized variable access if callers assume that `EinsumHelper::ParseEquation()` always sets these flags.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [f09caa532b6e1ac8d2aa61b7832c78c5b79300c6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/f09caa532b6e1ac8d2aa61b7832c78c5b79300c6).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
