- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header set by `nginz` was too lenient, allowing any subdomain of `.wire.com` (including `wire.com`) to access resources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Overly permissive CORS configuration. The `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header was set to allow requests from any subdomain of `.wire.com`, instead of restricting it to specific applications that require access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If an attacker finds an XSS vulnerability in any subdomain of `wire.com`, they can use it to make requests to the Wire API using the victim's cookies, potentially compromising user accounts or data. A compromise of a subdomain like `xyz.wire.com` could lead to access to cookies of other subdomains, e.g., `prod-nginz-https.wire.com`.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation through Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on a `wire.com` subdomain, combined with the overly broad CORS policy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject and execute malicious Javascript on a `wire.com` subdomain.
