  "CVE-2021-41675": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The provided content describes a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in the Sourcecodester E-Negosyo System 1.0. This vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization in the `getImageSize()` function and inadequate protection of the `/uploaded_photos/` directory, allowing attackers to upload and execute malicious code.",
    "details": [
      {
        "type": "Root cause of vulnerability",
        "description": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization within the `getImageSize()` function used for image validation and inadequate protection of the `/uploaded_photos/` directory."
      },
      {
        "type": "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present",
        "description": "The application has a flaw in how it handles file uploads. Specifically:\n\n*   Lack of proper sanitization of the `getimagesize()` function, which is intended to validate image files.\n*   Inadequate protection of the `/uploaded_photos/` directory. This allows an attacker to bypass image validation and upload arbitrary files, including malicious code."
      },
       {
        "type": "Impact of exploitation",
        "description": "By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE). This would enable them to:\n\n*   Execute arbitrary code on the server.\n*   Retrieve sensitive information about the application.\n*   Gain access to the server's architecture."
      },
      {
        "type": "Attack vectors",
        "description": "The primary attack vector is through the file upload functionality in the `/admin/products/controller.php` via the `doInsert` function. This involves:\n\n*   Uploading a malicious file crafted to bypass `getImageSize()` validation\n*   Using directory traversal techniques to navigate to the `/uploaded_photos/` directory."
      },
      {
        "type": "Required attacker capabilities/position",
         "description": "An attacker needs to have the following to exploit the vulnerability:\n*   Access to the admin panel.\n*   Ability to upload files, specifically through the product creation form.\n* Basic understanding of file upload bypass techniques."
