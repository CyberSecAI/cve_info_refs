- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is triggered when the controller receives a specific BACnet protocol packet, causing an uncaught exception.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An uncaught exception (CWE-248) in the BACnet communication function.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The exception causes the BACnet communication function to go into an "out of work" state, which can result in the controller undergoing a factory reset. This leads to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send a specific BACnet packet to the controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a specific BACnet packet to the affected device, which would likely be on the same network as the controller. No authentication is required.
