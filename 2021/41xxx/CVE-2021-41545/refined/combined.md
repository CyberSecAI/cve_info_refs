GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The Desigo DXR2 controllers are compact, programmable automation stations with increased functionality
and ﬂexibility to support the demands for standard control of terminal HVAC equipment and TRA (Total
Room Automation) applications.

The Desigo PXC3 series room automation stations can be used for buildings with more sophisticated
requirements on functionality and ﬂexibility. Desigo Room Automation is used when several disciplines
(HVAC, lighting, shading) are combined to form one solution and when high ﬂexibility is required.

The Desigo PXC4 building automation controller was designed for HVAC systems controls.
It was
developed as a compact device with built in IOs with the ability to expand to your needs using addition
TX-IO modules.

The Desigo PXC5 is a freely programmable controller for BACnet system-level functions such as alarm
routing, system-wide scheduling and trending, as well as device monitoring.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-41545

When the controller receives a speciﬁc BACnet protocol packet, an exception causes the BACnet
communication function to go into a “out of work” state and could result in the controller going into a
“factory reset” state.
