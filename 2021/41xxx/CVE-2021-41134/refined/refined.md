The provided content relates to CVE-2021-41134.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-controlled input.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Specifically, the `nbdime` application fails to properly sanitize user-provided strings. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts. The vulnerable code is present in `packages/nbdime/src/common/util.ts` and how it builds select elements and the display of error messages in `packages/webapp/src/app/diff.ts` and `packages/webapp/src/app/merge.ts`.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser session when they view a crafted notebook diff or merge. This can lead to various malicious activities, including stealing cookies, session hijacking, or defacement.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user views a diff or merge of a notebook containing malicious payloads. The attacker would need to craft or modify a notebook file and get a victim to view a diff/merge involving that file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft or modify notebook files with malicious payloads and cause a user to view a diff or merge of that notebook within the `nbdime` application.
