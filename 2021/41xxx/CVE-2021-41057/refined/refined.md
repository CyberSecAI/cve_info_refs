Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to improper file access control permissions within the CodeMeter Runtime for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269):** The CodeMeter Runtime does not properly restrict file access permissions when running on Windows.
- Specifically, the vulnerability allows for overwriting of existing system files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local attacker can cause a Denial of Service by overwriting essential system files which will crash the CodeMeter Runtime Server (CodeMeter.exe), resulting in a denial of service for the affected software or device using CodeMeter.
- This can interrupt the functionality of affected Siemens products.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** An attacker requires local access to the affected system.
- **Unprivileged Account:** The attacker needs only a basic user account to exploit the vulnerability.
- **File Manipulation:** The attack involves setting up a link to a special system file used with CmDongles. This allows the attacker to overwrite critical system files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local Access:** The attacker must have a local user account on the machine running the vulnerable CodeMeter Runtime service.
- **Basic User Privileges:** No special privileges or elevated access is required.

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Products:** All Windows versions of CodeMeter Runtime are affected.
- **Fixed Version:** The vulnerability is addressed in CodeMeter Runtime version 7.30a.
- **Mitigation:** Restricting unprivileged access, disabling "Mass Storage" container type
- **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.1
- The vulnerability was discovered by JokÅ«bas Arsoba.
- Siemens products using CodeMeter Runtime were also affected and require updates.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**
A local, unprivileged attacker can overwrite system files by creating a link to a specific system file used with CmDongles, leading to a denial of service in Wibu-Systems' CodeMeter Runtime for Windows and affected third party products.
