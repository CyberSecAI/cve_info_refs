Security Advisory WIBU-210910-01

Vulnerability title

CodeMeter Runtime for Windows: Denial of Service (DoS)

Vulnerability description

A local attacker could cause a Denial of Service by overwriting existing files on the affected system.

ï·  CVE: CVE-2021-41057
ï·  CVSS v3.1 base score: 7.1
ï·  CVSS v3.1 vector string: /AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
ï·  Vulnerability type: CWE-269

Vulnerability details

If an attacker with basic user capabilities manages to set up a link to a special system file used with
CmDongles, then essential files in the system could get overwritten.

Exploiting the vulnerability requires at least an unprivileged user account on the machine.

The mobile use of the CodeMeter Runtime is not affected by this vulnerability because in this case,
CodeMeter runs in the user space instead of running as a Windows service.

Affected products

Affected versions
All Windows versions

Fixed versions

Mitigations for affected versions

Following measures are recommended to reduce the risk until the fixed version can be installed. Please
be aware that not all mitigations apply to every possible product configuration, so please check which
of these could be relevant or applicable in your case.

ï·  Restrict unprivileged access to machines running the CodeMeter License Server service.
ï·  Disable the container type âMass Storageâ in CodeMeter: if there are no CmDongles connected
to the affected machine or if the connected CmDongles are configured as HID, the CodeMeter
communication  with  âMass  Storageâ  devices  can  be  disabled  at  the  Windows  Registry  as
follows:

o  Set

SUMMARY

WIBU Systems published information about a denial-of-service vulnerability and an associated ï¬x release
version of CodeMeter Runtime, a product provided by WIBU Systems and used in several Siemens
products for license management.

The vulnerability is described in the section âVulnerability Classiï¬cationâ below and got assigned the CVE
ID CVE-2021-41057. Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to crash the
CodeMeter Runtime Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe), which could cause a denial-of-service condition for the
affected Siemens product.

Siemens has released updates for the affected products and recommends to update to the latest versions.

applications requiring a high degree of customer-speciï¬c adaptability, large or complex applications and
projects that impose speciï¬c system requirements or functions.

SIMIT Simluation Platform allows the simulation of plant setups in order to anticipate faults in the early
planning phase.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiï¬cation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ï¬rst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciï¬c to the customerâs
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deï¬ned by the customer to accomplish ï¬nal scoring.

An additional classiï¬cation has been performed using the CWE classiï¬cation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiï¬cation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-41057

CodeMeter Runtime improperly controls ï¬le access permissions when running on Windows.

If local attackers with basic user capabilities manage to set up a link to a special system ï¬le used
with CmDongles, they could overwrite essential ï¬les in the system and thereby crash the CodeMeter
Runtime Server (i.e., CodeMeter.exe).

Remediation

ï·

ï·

If you are using the Wibu-Systemsâ hosting service (âWOPSâ) for the affected products, then
no actions are needed at your side.
If you are not using the Wibu-Systemsâ hosting service (âWOPSâ) for the affected products,
then you need to update these to the fixed versions or you can replace the Log4j library with
the fixed version 2.15.0 or later.

Mitigations for affected versions

If you are not using the Wibu-Systemsâ hosting service (âWOPSâ) for the affected product(s) please
consider following measures to reduce the risk until the fixed version of the affected product can be
installed. Please be aware that not all mitigations apply to every possible product configuration, so
please check which of these could be relevant or applicable in your case.

Implement one of the mitigation techniques below:

Java 8 (or later) users should upgrade to release 2.16.0.

ï·
ï·  Users requiring Java 7 should upgrade to release 2.12.2 when it becomes available (work in

progress, expected to be available soon).

ï·  Otherwise,  remove  the  JndiLookup  class  from  the  classpath:  zip  -q  -d  log4j-core-*.jar

org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class

Source of these mitigations: https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html

General security best practices can help to protect systems from local and network attacks.
