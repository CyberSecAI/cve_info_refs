# Setting up Multiple Repositories

There are two different ways that you can specify the use of multiple repositories. The first way is to specify in a POM which repositories you want to use. That is supported both inside and outside of build profiles:

```

<project>
...
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>my-repo1</id>
      <name>your custom repo</name>
      <url>http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk</url>
    </repository>
    <repository>
      <id>my-repo2</id>
      <name>your custom repo</name>
      <url>http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
...
</project>

```

**NOTE:** You will also get the standard set of repositories as defined in the [Super POM](../introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html#Super_POM).

The other way you can specify multiple repositories is by creating a profile in the `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml` or `${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml` file like the following:

```

<settings>
 ...
 <profiles>
   ...
   <profile>
     <id>myprofile</id>
     <repositories>
       <repository>
         <id>my-repo2</id>
         <name>your custom repo</name>
         <url>http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk</url>
       </repository>
     </repositories>
   </profile>
   ...
 </profiles>

 <activeProfiles>
   <activeProfile>myprofile</activeProfile>
 </activeProfiles>
 ...
</settings>

```

If you specify repositories in profiles you must remember to activate that particular profile! As you can see above we do this by registering a profile to be active in the `activeProfiles` element.

You could also activate this profile on the command like by executing the following command:

```

mvn -Pmyprofile ...

```

In fact the `-P` option will take a CSV list of profiles to activate if you wish to activate multiple profiles simultaneously.

**Note**: The settings descriptor documentation can be found on the [Maven Local Settings Model Website](../../maven-settings/settings.html).

## Repository Order

Remote repository URLs are queried in the following order for artifacts until one returns a valid result:

1. effective settings:
   1. Global `settings.xml`
   2. User `settings.xml`
2. local effective build POM:
   1. Local `pom.xml`
   2. Parent POMs, recursively
   3. Super POM
3. effective POMs from dependency path to the artifact.

For each of these locations, the repositories within the profiles are queried first in the order outlined at [Introduction to build profiles](../introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html).

Before downloading from a repository, [mirrors configuration](./guide-mirror-settings.html) is applied.

Effective settings and local build POM, with profile taken into account, can easily be reviewed to see their repositories order with `mvn help:effective-settings` and `mvn help:effective-pom -Dverbose`.

## Repository IDs

Each repository must have a **unique ID**. Clashing repository IDs within either effective settings or effective POMs lead to build failures. However, repositories from POM get overwritten by repositories with the same ID from effective settings. Repository IDs are also used in the [local repository metadata](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-repository-metadata/).

### **[iloveeclipse](/iloveeclipse)** commented [Jul 28, 2022](#issue-1321020859)

| I'm migrating our internal tooling from 4.21 to 4.25 platform, and see a lot of "unsafe http" warnings on startup at the time Oomph/update managers are checking for updates. So log has few warnings like: `Using unsafe http transport to retrieve http://our_local_server_in_intranet/, see CVE-2021-41033. Consider using https instead.`  I'm OK with reporting that in general, but either there should be a white list or a possibility to mute the warning. We have few local update sites, and some are maintained by teams that simply run some http server with no https/ssl support, others have https but certificates are self signed and expired, etc.  So ideally one should be able to add some known intranet sites, or just mute the warning. |

| I think the main goal of this is to annoy people so the switch to some safe communication channel, maven for example even fails for http for a while, so probably using https with a company-root certificate would be a better solution than having a switch, waiting for the next eclipse release and then enabling that switch on each and every product? |

| Our intranet **is** safe. If not, loading plugins to "unsafe" update sites will be the last thing an attacker will do. I'm already annoyed, but that will change nothing, simply because in an engineering environment where multiple teams have freedom to do anything that helps them to work aren't managed by a single administrator who can magically switch something and all services will run over https.  So just imagine there are people who worked tens of years absolutely safe without this warning and want to coninue to do same, without being annoyed... |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c0)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-28 20:13:29 EDT  ``` I originally raised this for Tycho at <https://github.com/eclipse/tycho/issues/248> and was asked by Mickael Istria to first ask here regarding this.  The main point is that downloading artifacts over unencrypted HTTP can allow man-in-the-middle attacks. Recent Maven releases have started blocking artifact downloads over unencrypted HTTP by default. Please have a look at the above mentioned GitHub issue for more information.  What is your opinion on this? ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c1)  Ed Merks [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-29 03:16:21 EDT  ``` People behind firewalls often have problems with https access failing...  Also, artifacts have checksums that would prevent successfully tampering the files themselves. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c2)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-29 04:11:46 EDT  ```  > Also, artifacts have checksums that would prevent successfully tampering the > files themselves.  The checksums in metadata can be tamperws as well, and since usually metadata come from the same site as artifacts, checksums are not a reliable source of trust; and they basically never were meant to be used for security,but more to detect transfer issues. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c3)  Ed Merks [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-29 04:19:54 EDT  ``` The artifacts generally come from mirrors while the site information comes from the original site, e.g., download.eclipse.org.   So whether https is used for the artifacts is somewhat orthogonal to whether https is used to access the metadata.  Are we concerned about site tampering as well?  Or just network tampering?  Because if the https access to download.eclipse.org is safe/secure, then the checksums are also safe/secure.     After all, we use checksums for downloads such as this:  <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/2021-06/R/eclipse-java-2021-06-R-win32-x86_64.zip>  Note that I'm just asking questions and making observations not saying what's right or wrong.  This bugzilla specifically mentions artifacts while I think the issue of security is broader than just the artifacts...  Also with signing, you can't really tamper signatures can you? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c4)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-29 11:42:36 EDT  ``` (In reply to Ed Merks from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c3)) > The artifacts generally come from mirrors while the site information comes > from the original site, e.g., download.eclipse.org.   I'm thinking about p2 repos in general, not about download.eclipse.org in particular. But if one tries to hack between download.eclipse.org and the user who tries to install (eg acts as a man in the middle that can modify output -thing that should be less possible with https than with http), then they can also tweak the metadata to disable mirrors. Basically, someone who wants to build an attack over p2 installation (inject their own artifacts instead of using reference ones) would be more successful just hacking the metadata and directing p2 to alternative sites and artifacts. Metadata are probably the weakest point of the process.  > Are we concerned about site tampering as well?  Or just network tampering?  > Because if the https access to download.eclipse.org is safe/secure, then the > checksums are also safe/secure.  I don't know about site tampering, but if we are concerned about network tampering then I think it's fair to make HTTP disbled by default as suggested by reported.  > After all, we use checksums for downloads such as this: > <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/> > downloads/release/2021-06/R/eclipse-java-2021-06-R-win32-x86_64.zip  What makes that checksums can be seen as a security verification approach is that the checksum comes from a source that is supposed to be trusted by user (assuming user trust eclipse.org and https is enough to ensure data integrity). It seems to me https plays an important role in ensuring we get correct checksums from the trusted site.   > This bugzilla specifically mentions artifacts while I think the issue of > security is broader than just the artifacts...  I agree and as mentioned above, metadata is probably more important than artifacts, it's probably a wider issue of whether we should fetch any http content by default in p2.  > Also with signing, you can't really tamper signatures can you?  One can tamper signatures, but they would then become invalid and the various checks in place would refuse to install the artifact with a wrong signature. However, it's possible to change to another signature, and this signature would be from another signer, that could try to use a "facade" that makes it seem official (eg writing ECLIРSE -with a cyrillic Р character instead of latin P), but this concern is not specific to p2 or HTTPS. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c5)  Eike Stepper [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-29 12:52:05 EDT  ``` (In reply to Mickael Istria from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c4)) >  > I'm thinking about p2 repos in general, not about download.eclipse.org in > particular. [...]  > [...] but if we are concerned about network > tampering then I think it's fair to make HTTP disbled by default as > suggested by reporter.  I'm a little bit confused about the motivation and the goal of this bug.   Is it all about the particular services at eclipse.org and perhaps related mirrors? In that case you could perhaps say "we are concerned (or not)".   But if you speak about p2 as a deployable technology and perhaps other non-Eclipse.org deployments, how can we be concerned about something (such as https access) not being disabled or not being the default configuration? Wouldn't that all be the responsibility of the deployer?  Or am I completely misunderstanding the suggestion of the reporter? ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c6)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-30 05:30:14 EDT  ``` (In reply to Eike Stepper from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c5)) > Is it all about the particular services at eclipse.org and perhaps related > mirrors? In that case you could perhaps say "we are concerned (or not)".   No, the scope of this bug is p2 in general; and should we let p2 use HTTP by default if it's know to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.  > But if you speak about p2 as a deployable technology and perhaps other > non-Eclipse.org deployments, how can we be concerned about something (such > as https access) not being disabled or not being the default configuration? > Wouldn't that all be the responsibility of the deployer?  I think it's easy to always say "that's the responsibility of the deployer", but in reality the underlying technology that does the installation (eg p2 or Maven) has a huge influence on how people will deploy. If we start having p2 disabling HTTP by default, then we send a clear sign to all providers that they should move to HTTPs and thus p2 becomes a lever of increased security instead of just dropping the ball to someplace else. See this interesting change from Maven: <https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.8.1/release-notes.html#cve-2021-26291> . This is what triggered the discussion here; p2 should probably have a similar CVE filed. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c7)  Eike Stepper [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-30 05:55:43 EDT  ``` (In reply to Mickael Istria from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c6)) > If we start having p2 disabling HTTP by default, then we send a clear sign > to all providers that they should move to HTTPs and thus p2 becomes a lever > of increased security instead of just dropping the ball to someplace else.  So what about all folks that happily use p2 in http environments where such attacks aren't possible through other means, for example private and corporate networks? Would your clear sign make their services stop working? ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c8)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-30 06:00:06 EDT  ``` (In reply to Eike Stepper from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c7)) > So what about all folks that happily use p2 in http environments where such > attacks aren't possible through other means, for example private and > corporate networks? Would your clear sign make their services stop working?  Good question. As far as I know, there wasn't too much negative feedback about Maven, which isn't too different. So I'm under the impression that although this can be an issue for some cases, requiring those cases to adapt might be less an issue than letting man-in-the-middle attack widely possible. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c9)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-30 19:38:51 EDT  ``` > Also, artifacts have checksums that would prevent successfully tampering the files themselves.  To me it looks like at least for mirrors this metadata could be used to verify the integrity of downloads, that includes: - Not downloading anything else (without checksums) from the mirror - Requiring that every artifact listed in the original repository has checksum and file size information - Not trusting insecure hash algorithms (?)  I am not very familiar with p2 (as well as Tycho), so it could be that they already behave this way. Maybe trusting mirrors is also a different topic (and should be discussed in a separate issue?), but it was also one of the concerns I voiced on the GitHub issue.  >> So what about all folks that happily use p2 in http environments where such >> attacks aren't possible through other means, for example private and >> corporate networks?

I am afraid the situation for Maven is a different one. For Maven you have Maven Central containing the majority of the artifacts. Additionally in the past the big Maven repositories have dropped unencrypted HTTP support (thanks to the effort of multiple security researchers), see <https://blog.sonatype.com/central-repository-moving-to-https>. So most users of Maven had already switched to HTTPS before Maven now dropped support for it. Additionally the other aspect of the Maven vulnerability was that Maven uses repositories declared by dependencies. However, due to Maven's Repository Order logic (<https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html#repository-order>) in most (if not all cases) it would not have used the repositories declared by dependencies, because it already found the artifacts in Maven Central. Another aspect for Maven is also that there is no "auto-updater", so it is very likely that a lot of users are still using versions below 3.8.1. It might therefore be difficult to tell how many are actually affected by unencrypted HTTP being blocked by default.  For Tycho the situation is a different one: - A large majority of code examples I saw (and even the ones inside the Tycho repository) are using unencrypted HTTP URLs, at least for the Eclipse p2 repositories. - There is (from my understanding) no one big p2 repository like Maven Central, so most users of Tycho have declared a custom repository (and as above, the URL most likely uses HTTP). - p2's support of mirrors (and maybe other features as well) define URLs inside the repository metadata. And even for the latest Eclipse repository some URLs (e.g. `p2.mirrorsURL`) still use HTTP. - The Eclipse repositories (such as <http://download.eclipse.org/releases/2021-06/>) don't upgrade HTTP to HTTPS when accessed from the browser. So when a user copies the URL (or edits an older download URL) they will keep using unencrypted HTTP unless they manually change it as well.  These were the reasons why I originally proposed (for Tycho) in the GitHub issue to automatically upgrade URLs to HTTPS (opt-out). This would at least address the main point of this issue which is the vulnerability against man-in-the-middle attacks. In the future it might then be a cleaner solution to block HTTP URLs instead (opt-out). Though as raised by Mickael Istria on the GitHub issue, upgrading to HTTPS might lead to unexpected (or cryptic) failures in case the repository does not properly support HTTPS. So the tooling would have to handle such errors (but only when they occurred for the automatic HTTP -> HTTPS upgrade) and wrap the exception in an exception with more useful message, explaining that an upgrade was attempted.  What do you think? ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c10)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-31 04:52:41 EDT  ``` (In reply to Some User from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c9)) > To me it looks like at least for mirrors this metadata could be used to > verify the integrity of downloads, that includes: > - Not downloading anything else (without checksums) from the mirror > - Requiring that every artifact listed in the original repository has > checksum and file size information > - Not trusting insecure hash algorithms (?)  Those checksum & size metadata are not mandatory, but in practice, they're always here in artifacts.xml file that are defined in a p2 repo. So yes, they are used to verify that the content we get from the site or a mirror does match what's expected by the metadata. However, those metadata files can be accessed by HTTP so they're also the target of man-in-the-middle attack. In practice, someone who want to hack and installation would only need to replace the metadata files, from there, they can do basically whatever they want, like fetching from another URL or some other mirrors. So it seems like we can assume that as long as metadata are immune to attacks and contain checksums+size, the whole installation is almost immune to attacks.  > Maybe trusting mirrors is also a different topic (and should be discussed in > a separate issue?), but it was also one of the concerns I voiced on the > GitHub issue.  As discussed above, I think we can assume that in the mirrors can be trusted as the content we get from them is verified against checksum retrieved from the "master" site.  > I am afraid the situation for Maven is a different one.

Same for p2: 1 main p2 repository ( <https://download.eclipse.org/releases/latest/> ) and many other ones wherever else.  > Additionally in the > past the big Maven repositories have dropped unencrypted HTTP support  Same for download.eclipse.org, and many other download servers, which has disabled HTTP support some time ago.  > Additionally the other aspect of the Maven vulnerability was that Maven > uses repositories declared by dependencies.

Headless p2 (used by eg. Tycho or CLI) doesn't inject extra repositories without user explicitly adding them. With the UI, there is a "Contact all software sites" checkbox, which is usually turned on in order to allow resolving dependencies over other repositories. IIRC, the Eclipse IDE comes with 2 repositories enabled by default: latest EPP and latest Platform.  > For Tycho the situation is a different one:  Tycho-specific issues are to be discussed on Tycho issue tracker.

As discussed above, if we have checksums in the metadata and metadata are fetched with HTTPS, then it should be impossible to get an incorrect/corrupted/tampered artifact. All of people who have used Eclipse IDE & p2 for a long time were actually hit at least once by an installation process that was failing because of some mirror serving wrong (out of date) content and artifact wasn't matching expected checksum.  > - The Eclipse repositories (such as > <http://download.eclipse.org/releases/2021-06/>) don't upgrade HTTP to HTTPS > when accessed from the browser.

But that would require changes nonetheless to fail if an artifact is downloaded over HTTP or from a mirror, and no checksum information is available. If I see that correctly, the current behavior is to simply download the artifact without any checks.  >> Additionally in the past the big Maven repositories have dropped unencrypted  >> HTTP support > Same for download.eclipse.org, and many other download servers, which has  > disabled HTTP support some time ago.  Has it really "disabled" HTTP support? At least from the browser I seem to be able to download <http://download.eclipse.org/releases/latest/compositeArtifacts.jar> (note the 'http:') just fine without any issues. Maven has really _dropped_ HTTP support. When I try to access <http://repo1.maven.org> I get an HTTP 501, and therefore builds tools would fail.  > Headless p2 (used by eg. Tycho or CLI) doesn't inject extra repositories without user explicitly adding them.  My point here was rather that, despite Maven offering the possibility for dependencies to declare custom repositories, in reality they would rarely or never be used by Maven for the dependency lookup. Whereas for p2 there seem to be multiple places within the metadata where URLs can specified. For the `mirrorsURL` it would indeed not be a problem (assuming that checksums are verified). But another example I noticed is <https://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen/compositeArtifacts.jar> which specifies an unecrypted HTTP URL. So for p2 there might be more places to look out for, and more situations where in reality URLs in the metadata are actually used, and can therefore not be changed manually to use HTTPS by the user of p2 / Tycho.  > Even slower, I think we could just do nothing in p2 in the end, and just focus on the infra forcing redirection from http to https.  Is "infra" here referring to p2 components or the download.eclipse.org site? In case of the latter, then this would not really be effective: 1. Users might be using other repositories where unencrypted HTTP access is still supported 2. Having the server upgrade / redirect from HTTP to HTTPS adds no security. Unless the client enforces this upgrade, an attacker could easily make the client continue using HTTP or respond with an HTTP redirect to their own malicious repository using HTTPS.  > Can you please report it to the infra team for consideration?

I've kind of changed my mind here (again) as I believe it's also important to drive towards more security. However, I don't think we need to enforce HTTPS for artifacts: as the discussion reveals if metadata are free from man-in-the-middle attacks (thanks to HTTPS) and artifacts have good checksums/size info, then it's fine to download with HTTP and compare the received file with what is in metadata and reject it if it doesn't match.  @Eike: are you aware of concrete setups that would be broken by such a change?

For all I know p2 is behaving already such that tampered artifacts can not be installed if the metadata can not be hacked. Whether metadata can be hacked (via http) or not (via https) is a decision of the metadata provider. If you want to give the end user more choice you can add a new option in p2 to disallow the use of metadata over http. But if you make that new option the new default you'll probably break someone. Is that your new proposal? ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c17)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-08 04:04:19 EDT  ``` (In reply to Eike Stepper from [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c16)) > Whether metadata can be hacked (via http) or not (via > https) is a decision of the metadata provider.  Yes, but since metadata do provide the essential part of ensuring we get the right artifacts (ie checksums), this is the critical point to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. If metadata are safe (not hacked) and do contain checksums to verify artifact, then the overall installation is fine and that the retrieved artifacts do match expectation of the metadata provider. My proposal would be that we move -progressively- towards disabling fetching metadta via http to encourage the metadata provider to move to the safer https and to protect end-users of the Eclipse IDE or most Eclipse RCP applications against such man-in-the-middle attacks when installing artifacts. I'm not certain that as a technology that's about installing software, we should really consider that we need to consider the metadata provider decision to be hackable as a 1st class citizen; compared to p2's decision of preventing its millions of users against man-in-the-middle attacks.  > If you want to give the end > user more choice you can add a new option in p2 to disallow the use of > metadata over http.  Yes, that would be 1 increment; this + a warning when using http.  > But if you make that new option the new default you'll > probably break someone.  We're somehow already kind of breaking millions of users by making their p2 installations vulnarable to man-in-the-middle attacks. IMO, the balance is on the side of more security rather than on the side of backward compatibility. And even about backward compatibility, this was my previous question, are you concretely aware about 1 case where moving away from http to https would be a major issue? Do you happen to personally support one of them? Ie is your reluctance based on a current need you have, or more on a dogmatic (not to be read negatively) backward compatibility concern? As far as I see, most p2 repos that get provided in open-source (be it with download.eclipse.org, or bintray, or GitHub sites, or major Nexus instances...) are using https by default as the underlying server simply abandoned http; and it's been so for some time now; so I don't foresee such a restriction towards https for p2 metadata as a big concern, especially if we plan for it over 6 months and communicate about it early enough. ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c18)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-11 19:08:12 EDT  ``` I really like the direction in which this discussion is moving now; but as mentioned by [comment#13](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c13) there is metadata out there which uses HTTP URLs, such as composite repository metadata created for older Eclipse releases. Disabling unencrypted HTTP would prevent users from using these repositories at all, forcing them to allow all unencrypted HTTP usage. As mentioned before I would therefore suggest the following setting with the following values: insecureHttpConnections:   - block     Completely blocks all unencrypted HTTP connections (potential exception might be mirrors, assuming that mirror usage always enforces checksums; currently not the case).   - use-https / upgrade-to-https     Always uses HTTPS for connections, even if URLs use HTTP. However, a warning should be logged in these cases, explaining that an HTTP URL was encountered and the connection will be upgraded. Connection errors need to be handled properly to indicate to the user that an HTTPS upgrade was attempted, but failed.   - allow     Same as the current behavior; vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. For connections using unencrypted HTTP a warning should be logged. Additionally it would be good to log a warning at the start just for that fact that "allow" was chosen (even if no HTTP URLs are encountered).  Initially the default should become "use-https", as pointed out by Mickael Istria the major repositories do support HTTPS so this would not be a breaking change, even for old metadata using HTTP URLs. The next step in the future could be then to make "block" block; this will definitely guarantee then that maintainers become aware and ideally use HTTP URLs, protecting those who are using older or different libraries no enforcing usage of HTTPS yet. Users can still switch manually back to "use-https" if necessary.  Eventually you will probably need to talk about CVEs again, when a solution has been implemented. If Maven got one for nearly the same situation, p2 and dependent projects will need CVEs too. If done properly code scanning tools such as GitHub's Dependabot can then notice the vulnerable dependencies and help making sure that developers upgrade their dependencies or build tools (such as Tycho). ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c19)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-11 19:10:44 EDT  ``` > to make "block" block  Sorry, meant  > to make "block" the default ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c20)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-13 03:01:53 EDT  ``` (In reply to Some User from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c18)) > Disabling unencrypted HTTP would prevent users from using these repositories > at all, forcing them to allow all unencrypted HTTP usage.  I don't see it as an issue. The case of some people needing to enable HTTP because of some repos using HTTP is more an issue that has to become the responsibility of the user (enabling http) and/or of the provider p2 repo (enabling https).

I can gather data to back that concern up with facts after I'm back from traveling...  The problem as I see it is that the user is not in a good position to fix composite sites or site references.  They must rely on someone else to fix them and those who need to fix the sites may well be quite unresponsive leaving the user with a bad impression of Eclipse.  Yes we can tell them it's for their safety and comfort but it seems me could make it more comfortable without making it less safe. I.e., why not just upgrade to https automatically so that things just continue to work except when the site host itself does no support https?  That seems less likely to cause problems than simply blocking access and then requiring the site itself to be fixed...   > > As mentioned > > before I would therefore suggest the following setting with the following > > values: > > insecureHttpConnections: > >   - block [...] > >   - use-https / upgrade-to-https [...] > >   - allow [...] >  > IMO, only block and allow are enough. >    If you can only provide two options for whatever reason, redirect or allow seems also sufficient to address the problem. ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c23)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-13 16:54:15 EDT  ``` I've assigned CVE-2021-41033 and have reported this as vulnerability against Eclipse Equinox. ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c24)  Ed Merks [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-24 09:25:02 EDT  ``` Created [attachment 287207](attachment.cgi?id=287207 "A list fo repositories and their non-https absolute child URIs") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=287207&action=edit "A list fo repositories and their non-https absolute child URIs") A list fo repositories and their non-https absolute child URIs  These are the +1400 cases where a download.eclipse.org repository has an absolute child URI that is not https. ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c25)  Ed Merks [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-24 10:53:11 EDT  ``` BTW, I've included these as errors in the report:  <https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/archive/p2-index/> ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c26)  Chris Notenboom [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-28 16:48:48 EDT  ``` I think the CVE registration is possible generating a lot of false positives for developers using tools like owasp.

Our practice has been to set the "product name" in CVEs to the project. In this case, I set the product name to "Eclipse Equinox".   The short version is that I don't know how the data that we provide to Mitre through the CVE programme is converted into the information that tools like owasp use, so I'm not sure what we need to do differently.

The version 3.15 of org.eclipse.equinox.common is a bundle version while version 4.21 must be referring to the Eclipse Equinox project release version.  With that said, the statement in the CVE is a distraction:  "In all released versions of Eclipse Equinox, at least until version 4.21 (September 2021)..."  Here we are only talking about the p2 bundles that deal communicating with remote p2 repositories.  This has nothing to do with all the other bundles included in Equinox.

## Accelerate performance

With GitHub Copilot embedded throughout the platform, you can simplify your toolchain, automate tasks, and improve the developer experience.

![](https://github.githubassets.com/assets/particles-de1dd20f3008.png)A Copilot chat window with extensions enabled. The user inputs the @ symbol to reveal a list of five Copilot Extensions. @Sentry is selected from the list, which shifts the window to a chat directly with that extension. There are three sample prompts at the bottom of the chat window, allowing the user to Get incident information, Edit status on incident, or List the latest issues. The last one is activated to send the prompt: @Sentry List the latest issues. The extension then lists several new issues and their metadata.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c0)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-28 20:13:29 EDT  ``` I originally raised this for Tycho at <https://github.com/eclipse/tycho/issues/248> and was asked by Mickael Istria to first ask here regarding this.  The main point is that downloading artifacts over unencrypted HTTP can allow man-in-the-middle attacks. Recent Maven releases have started blocking artifact downloads over unencrypted HTTP by default. Please have a look at the above mentioned GitHub issue for more information.  What is your opinion on this? ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c1)  Ed Merks [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-29 03:16:21 EDT  ``` People behind firewalls often have problems with https access failing...  Also, artifacts have checksums that would prevent successfully tampering the files themselves. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c2)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-29 04:11:46 EDT  ```  > Also, artifacts have checksums that would prevent successfully tampering the > files themselves.  The checksums in metadata can be tamperws as well, and since usually metadata come from the same site as artifacts, checksums are not a reliable source of trust; and they basically never were meant to be used for security,but more to detect transfer issues. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c3)  Ed Merks [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-29 04:19:54 EDT  ``` The artifacts generally come from mirrors while the site information comes from the original site, e.g., download.eclipse.org.   So whether https is used for the artifacts is somewhat orthogonal to whether https is used to access the metadata.  Are we concerned about site tampering as well?  Or just network tampering?  Because if the https access to download.eclipse.org is safe/secure, then the checksums are also safe/secure.     After all, we use checksums for downloads such as this:  <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/downloads/release/2021-06/R/eclipse-java-2021-06-R-win32-x86_64.zip>  Note that I'm just asking questions and making observations not saying what's right or wrong.  This bugzilla specifically mentions artifacts while I think the issue of security is broader than just the artifacts...  Also with signing, you can't really tamper signatures can you? ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c4)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-29 11:42:36 EDT  ``` (In reply to Ed Merks from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c3)) > The artifacts generally come from mirrors while the site information comes > from the original site, e.g., download.eclipse.org.   I'm thinking about p2 repos in general, not about download.eclipse.org in particular. But if one tries to hack between download.eclipse.org and the user who tries to install (eg acts as a man in the middle that can modify output -thing that should be less possible with https than with http), then they can also tweak the metadata to disable mirrors. Basically, someone who wants to build an attack over p2 installation (inject their own artifacts instead of using reference ones) would be more successful just hacking the metadata and directing p2 to alternative sites and artifacts. Metadata are probably the weakest point of the process.  > Are we concerned about site tampering as well?  Or just network tampering?  > Because if the https access to download.eclipse.org is safe/secure, then the > checksums are also safe/secure.  I don't know about site tampering, but if we are concerned about network tampering then I think it's fair to make HTTP disbled by default as suggested by reported.  > After all, we use checksums for downloads such as this: > <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/technology/epp/> > downloads/release/2021-06/R/eclipse-java-2021-06-R-win32-x86_64.zip  What makes that checksums can be seen as a security verification approach is that the checksum comes from a source that is supposed to be trusted by user (assuming user trust eclipse.org and https is enough to ensure data integrity). It seems to me https plays an important role in ensuring we get correct checksums from the trusted site.   > This bugzilla specifically mentions artifacts while I think the issue of > security is broader than just the artifacts...  I agree and as mentioned above, metadata is probably more important than artifacts, it's probably a wider issue of whether we should fetch any http content by default in p2.  > Also with signing, you can't really tamper signatures can you?  One can tamper signatures, but they would then become invalid and the various checks in place would refuse to install the artifact with a wrong signature. However, it's possible to change to another signature, and this signature would be from another signer, that could try to use a "facade" that makes it seem official (eg writing ECLIРSE -with a cyrillic Р character instead of latin P), but this concern is not specific to p2 or HTTPS. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c5)  Eike Stepper [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-29 12:52:05 EDT  ``` (In reply to Mickael Istria from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c4)) >  > I'm thinking about p2 repos in general, not about download.eclipse.org in > particular. [...]  > [...] but if we are concerned about network > tampering then I think it's fair to make HTTP disbled by default as > suggested by reporter.  I'm a little bit confused about the motivation and the goal of this bug.   Is it all about the particular services at eclipse.org and perhaps related mirrors? In that case you could perhaps say "we are concerned (or not)".   But if you speak about p2 as a deployable technology and perhaps other non-Eclipse.org deployments, how can we be concerned about something (such as https access) not being disabled or not being the default configuration? Wouldn't that all be the responsibility of the deployer?  Or am I completely misunderstanding the suggestion of the reporter? ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c6)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-30 05:30:14 EDT  ``` (In reply to Eike Stepper from [comment #5](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c5)) > Is it all about the particular services at eclipse.org and perhaps related > mirrors? In that case you could perhaps say "we are concerned (or not)".   No, the scope of this bug is p2 in general; and should we let p2 use HTTP by default if it's know to be vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks.  > But if you speak about p2 as a deployable technology and perhaps other > non-Eclipse.org deployments, how can we be concerned about something (such > as https access) not being disabled or not being the default configuration? > Wouldn't that all be the responsibility of the deployer?  I think it's easy to always say "that's the responsibility of the deployer", but in reality the underlying technology that does the installation (eg p2 or Maven) has a huge influence on how people will deploy. If we start having p2 disabling HTTP by default, then we send a clear sign to all providers that they should move to HTTPs and thus p2 becomes a lever of increased security instead of just dropping the ball to someplace else. See this interesting change from Maven: <https://maven.apache.org/docs/3.8.1/release-notes.html#cve-2021-26291> . This is what triggered the discussion here; p2 should probably have a similar CVE filed. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c7)  Eike Stepper [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-30 05:55:43 EDT  ``` (In reply to Mickael Istria from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c6)) > If we start having p2 disabling HTTP by default, then we send a clear sign > to all providers that they should move to HTTPs and thus p2 becomes a lever > of increased security instead of just dropping the ball to someplace else.  So what about all folks that happily use p2 in http environments where such attacks aren't possible through other means, for example private and corporate networks?

Would your clear sign make their services stop working?  Good question. As far as I know, there wasn't too much negative feedback about Maven, which isn't too different. So I'm under the impression that although this can be an issue for some cases, requiring those cases to adapt might be less an issue than letting man-in-the-middle attack widely possible. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c9)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-30 19:38:51 EDT  ``` > Also, artifacts have checksums that would prevent successfully tampering the files themselves.  To me it looks like at least for mirrors this metadata could be used to verify the integrity of downloads, that includes: - Not downloading anything else (without checksums) from the mirror - Requiring that every artifact listed in the original repository has checksum and file size information - Not trusting insecure hash algorithms (?)  I am not very familiar with p2 (as well as Tycho), so it could be that they already behave this way. Maybe trusting mirrors is also a different topic (and should be discussed in a separate issue?), but it was also one of the concerns I voiced on the GitHub issue.  >> So what about all folks that happily use p2 in http environments where such >> attacks aren't possible through other means, for example private and >> corporate networks? Would your clear sign make their services stop working? > > Good question. As far as I know, there wasn't too much negative feedback about > Maven, which isn't too different.  I am afraid the situation for Maven is a different one. For Maven you have Maven Central containing the majority of the artifacts. Additionally in the past the big Maven repositories have dropped unencrypted HTTP support (thanks to the effort of multiple security researchers), see <https://blog.sonatype.com/central-repository-moving-to-https>. So most users of Maven had already switched to HTTPS before Maven now dropped support for it. Additionally the other aspect of the Maven vulnerability was that Maven uses repositories declared by dependencies. However, due to Maven's Repository Order logic (<https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html#repository-order>) in most (if not all cases) it would not have used the repositories declared by dependencies, because it already found the artifacts in Maven Central. Another aspect for Maven is also that there is no "auto-updater", so it is very likely that a lot of users are still using versions below 3.8.1. It might therefore be difficult to tell how many are actually affected by unencrypted HTTP being blocked by default.  For Tycho the situation is a different one: - A large majority of code examples I saw (and even the ones inside the Tycho repository) are using unencrypted HTTP URLs, at least for the Eclipse p2 repositories. - There is (from my understanding) no one big p2 repository like Maven Central, so most users of Tycho have declared a custom repository (and as above, the URL most likely uses HTTP). - p2's support of mirrors (and maybe other features as well) define URLs inside the repository metadata. And even for the latest Eclipse repository some URLs (e.g. `p2.mirrorsURL`) still use HTTP. - The Eclipse repositories (such as <http://download.eclipse.org/releases/2021-06/>) don't upgrade HTTP to HTTPS when accessed from the browser. So when a user copies the URL (or edits an older download URL) they will keep using unencrypted HTTP unless they manually change it as well.  These were the reasons why I originally proposed (for Tycho) in the GitHub issue to automatically upgrade URLs to HTTPS (opt-out). This would at least address the main point of this issue which is the vulnerability against man-in-the-middle attacks. In the future it might then be a cleaner solution to block HTTP URLs instead (opt-out). Though as raised by Mickael Istria on the GitHub issue, upgrading to HTTPS might lead to unexpected (or cryptic) failures in case the repository does not properly support HTTPS. So the tooling would have to handle such errors (but only when they occurred for the automatic HTTP -> HTTPS upgrade) and wrap the exception in an exception with more useful message, explaining that an upgrade was attempted.  What do you think? ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c10)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-31 04:52:41 EDT  ``` (In reply to Some User from [comment #9](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c9)) > To me it looks like at least for mirrors this metadata could be used to > verify the integrity of downloads, that includes: > - Not downloading anything else (without checksums) from the mirror > - Requiring that every artifact listed in the original repository has > checksum and file size information > - Not trusting insecure hash algorithms (?)  Those checksum & size metadata are not mandatory, but in practice, they're always here in artifacts.xml file that are defined in a p2 repo. So yes, they are used to verify that the content we get from the site or a mirror does match what's expected by the metadata. However, those metadata files can be accessed by HTTP so they're also the target of man-in-the-middle attack. In practice, someone who want to hack and installation would only need to replace the metadata files, from there, they can do basically whatever they want, like fetching from another URL or some other mirrors. So it seems like we can assume that as long as metadata are immune to attacks and contain checksums+size, the whole installation is almost immune to attacks.  > Maybe trusting mirrors is also a different topic (and should be discussed in > a separate issue?), but it was also one of the concerns I voiced on the > GitHub issue.  As discussed above, I think we can assume that in the mirrors can be trusted as the content we get from them is verified against checksum retrieved from the "master" site.  > I am afraid the situation for Maven is a different one.

Headless p2 (used by eg. Tycho or CLI) doesn't inject extra repositories without user explicitly adding them. With the UI, there is a "Contact all software sites" checkbox, which is usually turned on in order to allow resolving dependencies over other repositories. IIRC, the Eclipse IDE comes with 2 repositories enabled by default: latest EPP and latest Platform.  > For Tycho the situation is a different one:  Tycho-specific issues are to be discussed on Tycho issue tracker.

As discussed above, if we have checksums in the metadata and metadata are fetched with HTTPS, then it should be impossible to get an incorrect/corrupted/tampered artifact. All of people who have used Eclipse IDE & p2 for a long time were actually hit at least once by an installation process that was failing because of some mirror serving wrong (out of date) content and artifact wasn't matching expected checksum.  > - The Eclipse repositories (such as > <http://download.eclipse.org/releases/2021-06/>) don't upgrade HTTP to HTTPS > when accessed from the browser.

But that would require changes nonetheless to fail if an artifact is downloaded over HTTP or from a mirror, and no checksum information is available. If I see that correctly, the current behavior is to simply download the artifact without any checks.  >> Additionally in the past the big Maven repositories have dropped unencrypted  >> HTTP support > Same for download.eclipse.org, and many other download servers, which has  > disabled HTTP support some time ago.  Has it really "disabled" HTTP support? At least from the browser I seem to be able to download <http://download.eclipse.org/releases/latest/compositeArtifacts.jar> (note the 'http:') just fine without any issues. Maven has really _dropped_ HTTP support. When I try to access <http://repo1.maven.org> I get an HTTP 501, and therefore builds tools would fail.  > Headless p2 (used by eg. Tycho or CLI) doesn't inject extra repositories without user explicitly adding them.  My point here was rather that, despite Maven offering the possibility for dependencies to declare custom repositories, in reality they would rarely or never be used by Maven for the dependency lookup. Whereas for p2 there seem to be multiple places within the metadata where URLs can specified. For the `mirrorsURL` it would indeed not be a problem (assuming that checksums are verified). But another example I noticed is <https://download.eclipse.org/releases/oxygen/compositeArtifacts.jar> which specifies an unecrypted HTTP URL. So for p2 there might be more places to look out for, and more situations where in reality URLs in the metadata are actually used, and can therefore not be changed manually to use HTTPS by the user of p2 / Tycho.  > Even slower, I think we could just do nothing in p2 in the end, and just focus on the infra forcing redirection from http to https.  Is "infra" here referring to p2 components or the download.eclipse.org site? In case of the latter, then this would not really be effective: 1. Users might be using other repositories where unencrypted HTTP access is still supported 2. Having the server upgrade / redirect from HTTP to HTTPS adds no security. Unless the client enforces this upgrade, an attacker could easily make the client continue using HTTP or respond with an HTTP redirect to their own malicious repository using HTTPS.  > Can you please report it to the infra team for consideration?

I've kind of changed my mind here (again) as I believe it's also important to drive towards more security. However, I don't think we need to enforce HTTPS for artifacts: as the discussion reveals if metadata are free from man-in-the-middle attacks (thanks to HTTPS) and artifacts have good checksums/size info, then it's fine to download with HTTP and compare the received file with what is in metadata and reject it if it doesn't match.  @Eike: are you aware of concrete setups that would be broken by such a change?

For all I know p2 is behaving already such that tampered artifacts can not be installed if the metadata can not be hacked. Whether metadata can be hacked (via http) or not (via https) is a decision of the metadata provider. If you want to give the end user more choice you can add a new option in p2 to disallow the use of metadata over http. But if you make that new option the new default you'll probably break someone. Is that your new proposal? ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c17)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-08 04:04:19 EDT  ``` (In reply to Eike Stepper from [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c16)) > Whether metadata can be hacked (via http) or not (via > https) is a decision of the metadata provider.  Yes, but since metadata do provide the essential part of ensuring we get the right artifacts (ie checksums), this is the critical point to protect against man-in-the-middle attacks. If metadata are safe (not hacked) and do contain checksums to verify artifact, then the overall installation is fine and that the retrieved artifacts do match expectation of the metadata provider. My proposal would be that we move -progressively- towards disabling fetching metadta via http to encourage the metadata provider to move to the safer https and to protect end-users of the Eclipse IDE or most Eclipse RCP applications against such man-in-the-middle attacks when installing artifacts. I'm not certain that as a technology that's about installing software, we should really consider that we need to consider the metadata provider decision to be hackable as a 1st class citizen; compared to p2's decision of preventing its millions of users against man-in-the-middle attacks.  > If you want to give the end > user more choice you can add a new option in p2 to disallow the use of > metadata over http.  Yes, that would be 1 increment; this + a warning when using http.  > But if you make that new option the new default you'll > probably break someone.  We're somehow already kind of breaking millions of users by making their p2 installations vulnarable to man-in-the-middle attacks. IMO, the balance is on the side of more security rather than on the side of backward compatibility. And even about backward compatibility, this was my previous question, are you concretely aware about 1 case where moving away from http to https would be a major issue? Do you happen to personally support one of them? Ie is your reluctance based on a current need you have, or more on a dogmatic (not to be read negatively) backward compatibility concern? As far as I see, most p2 repos that get provided in open-source (be it with download.eclipse.org, or bintray, or GitHub sites, or major Nexus instances...) are using https by default as the underlying server simply abandoned http; and it's been so for some time now; so I don't foresee such a restriction towards https for p2 metadata as a big concern, especially if we plan for it over 6 months and communicate about it early enough. ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c18)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-11 19:08:12 EDT  ``` I really like the direction in which this discussion is moving now; but as mentioned by [comment#13](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c13) there is metadata out there which uses HTTP URLs, such as composite repository metadata created for older Eclipse releases. Disabling unencrypted HTTP would prevent users from using these repositories at all, forcing them to allow all unencrypted HTTP usage. As mentioned before I would therefore suggest the following setting with the following values: insecureHttpConnections:   - block     Completely blocks all unencrypted HTTP connections (potential exception might be mirrors, assuming that mirror usage always enforces checksums; currently not the case).   - use-https / upgrade-to-https     Always uses HTTPS for connections, even if URLs use HTTP. However, a warning should be logged in these cases, explaining that an HTTP URL was encountered and the connection will be upgraded. Connection errors need to be handled properly to indicate to the user that an HTTPS upgrade was attempted, but failed.   - allow     Same as the current behavior; vulnerable to man-in-the-middle attacks. For connections using unencrypted HTTP a warning should be logged. Additionally it would be good to log a warning at the start just for that fact that "allow" was chosen (even if no HTTP URLs are encountered).  Initially the default should become "use-https", as pointed out by Mickael Istria the major repositories do support HTTPS so this would not be a breaking change, even for old metadata using HTTP URLs. The next step in the future could be then to make "block" block; this will definitely guarantee then that maintainers become aware and ideally use HTTP URLs, protecting those who are using older or different libraries no enforcing usage of HTTPS yet. Users can still switch manually back to "use-https" if necessary.  Eventually you will probably need to talk about CVEs again, when a solution has been implemented. If Maven got one for nearly the same situation, p2 and dependent projects will need CVEs too. If done properly code scanning tools such as GitHub's Dependabot can then notice the vulnerable dependencies and help making sure that developers upgrade their dependencies or build tools (such as Tycho). ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c19)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-11 19:10:44 EDT  ``` > to make "block" block  Sorry, meant  > to make "block" the default ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c20)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-13 03:01:53 EDT  ``` (In reply to Some User from [comment #18](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c18)) > Disabling unencrypted HTTP would prevent users from using these repositories > at all, forcing them to allow all unencrypted HTTP usage.  I don't see it as an issue. The case of some people needing to enable HTTP because of some repos using HTTP is more an issue that has to become the responsibility of the user (enabling http) and/or of the provider p2 repo (enabling https). I don't think p2 has to try to be smart here, since the final goal is to make most p2 repo provider stop using http at all.  > As mentioned > before I would therefore suggest the following setting with the following > values: > insecureHttpConnections: >   - block [...] >   - use-https / upgrade-to-https [...] >   - allow [...]  IMO, only block and allow are enough.   > Eventually you will probably need to talk about CVEs again, when a solution > has been implemented.

Note that I'm not experienced at all with CVEs, so I basically won't ba able to take care of it without guidance and assistance.  In the best case, this becomes a CVE and the CVE is interpreted as severe enough to allow direct action such as disabling HTTP fully by default in p2; and just have some option (eg a system property) to re-enable it. ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c22)  Ed Merks [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-13 11:10:40 EDT  ``` I think the title doesn't really reflect the problem...

I can gather data to back that concern up with facts after I'm back from traveling...  The problem as I see it is that the user is not in a good position to fix composite sites or site references.  They must rely on someone else to fix them and those who need to fix the sites may well be quite unresponsive leaving the user with a bad impression of Eclipse.  Yes we can tell them it's for their safety and comfort but it seems me could make it more comfortable without making it less safe. I.e., why not just upgrade to https automatically so that things just continue to work except when the site host itself does no support https?  That seems less likely to cause problems than simply blocking access and then requiring the site itself to be fixed...   > > As mentioned > > before I would therefore suggest the following setting with the following > > values: > > insecureHttpConnections: > >   - block [...] > >   - use-https / upgrade-to-https [...] > >   - allow [...] >  > IMO, only block and allow are enough. >    If you can only provide two options for whatever reason, redirect or allow seems also sufficient to address the problem. ```  [Comment 23](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c23)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-13 16:54:15 EDT  ``` I've assigned CVE-2021-41033 and have reported this as vulnerability against Eclipse Equinox. ```  [Comment 24](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c24)  Ed Merks [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-24 09:25:02 EDT  ``` Created [attachment 287207](attachment.cgi?id=287207 "A list fo repositories and their non-https absolute child URIs") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=287207&action=edit "A list fo repositories and their non-https absolute child URIs") A list fo repositories and their non-https absolute child URIs  These are the +1400 cases where a download.eclipse.org repository has an absolute child URI that is not https. ```  [Comment 25](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c25)  Ed Merks [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-24 10:53:11 EDT  ``` BTW, I've included these as errors in the report:  <https://download.eclipse.org/oomph/archive/p2-index/> ```  [Comment 26](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c26)  Chris Notenboom [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-28 16:48:48 EDT  ``` I think the CVE registration is possible generating a lot of false positives for developers using tools like owasp. Especially because of the high rating.  As I understand the solution is not yet released, which makes upgrading to a safe version impossible.  We use the FileLocator from org.eclipse.equinox.common, which is at this moment version 3.15.0 on mvn central. However the CVE states that the bug can be found in  every "eclipse.equinox" bundle up to version 4.21  a) is org.eclipse.equinox.common correctly marked as vulnerable by this CVE or is it about other parts of the equinox bundle? b) if org.eclipse.equinox.common is vulnerable, is it possible to make the CVE more precise with specific different versions?

Our practice has been to set the "product name" in CVEs to the project. In this case, I set the product name to "Eclipse Equinox".   The short version is that I don't know how the data that we provide to Mitre through the CVE programme is converted into the information that tools like owasp use, so I'm not sure what we need to do differently. It's time to sort that out.

The version 3.15 of org.eclipse.equinox.common is a bundle version while version 4.21 must be referring to the Eclipse Equinox project release version.  With that said, the statement in the CVE is a distraction:  "In all released versions of Eclipse Equinox, at least until version 4.21 (September 2021)..."  Here we are only talking about the p2 bundles that deal communicating with remote p2 repositories.  This has nothing to do with all the other bundles included in Equinox.  The org.eclipse.equinox.common is not affected by this Equinox p2 issue. ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c29)  Andrew Johnson [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2023-01-04 11:52:58 EST  ``` I see that now <http://download.eclipse.org> redirects to https  Should p2 respect HSTS ?

# Setting up Multiple Repositories

There are two different ways that you can specify the use of multiple repositories. The first way is to specify in a POM which repositories you want to use. That is supported both inside and outside of build profiles:

```

<project>
...
  <repositories>
    <repository>
      <id>my-repo1</id>
      <name>your custom repo</name>
      <url>http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk</url>
    </repository>
    <repository>
      <id>my-repo2</id>
      <name>your custom repo</name>
      <url>http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk</url>
    </repository>
  </repositories>
...
</project>

```

**NOTE:** You will also get the standard set of repositories as defined in the [Super POM](../introduction/introduction-to-the-pom.html#Super_POM).

The other way you can specify multiple repositories is by creating a profile in the `${user.home}/.m2/settings.xml` or `${maven.home}/conf/settings.xml` file like the following:

```

<settings>
 ...
 <profiles>
   ...
   <profile>
     <id>myprofile</id>
     <repositories>
       <repository>
         <id>my-repo2</id>
         <name>your custom repo</name>
         <url>http://jarsm2.dyndns.dk</url>
       </repository>
     </repositories>
   </profile>
   ...
 </profiles>

 <activeProfiles>
   <activeProfile>myprofile</activeProfile>
 </activeProfiles>
 ...
</settings>

```

If you specify repositories in profiles you must remember to activate that particular profile! As you can see above we do this by registering a profile to be active in the `activeProfiles` element.

You could also activate this profile on the command like by executing the following command:

```

mvn -Pmyprofile ...

```

In fact the `-P` option will take a CSV list of profiles to activate if you wish to activate multiple profiles simultaneously.

**Note**: The settings descriptor documentation can be found on the [Maven Local Settings Model Website](../../maven-settings/settings.html).

## Repository Order

Remote repository URLs are queried in the following order for artifacts until one returns a valid result:

1. effective settings:
   1. Global `settings.xml`
   2. User `settings.xml`
2. local effective build POM:
   1. Local `pom.xml`
   2. Parent POMs, recursively
   3. Super POM
3. effective POMs from dependency path to the artifact.

For each of these locations, the repositories within the profiles are queried first in the order outlined at [Introduction to build profiles](../introduction/introduction-to-profiles.html).

Before downloading from a repository, [mirrors configuration](./guide-mirror-settings.html) is applied.

Effective settings and local build POM, with profile taken into account, can easily be reviewed to see their repositories order with `mvn help:effective-settings` and `mvn help:effective-pom -Dverbose`.

## Repository IDs

Each repository must have a **unique ID**. Clashing repository IDs within either effective settings or effective POMs lead to build failures. However, repositories from POM get overwritten by repositories with the same ID from effective settings. Repository IDs are also used in the [local repository metadata](https://maven.apache.org/ref/3-LATEST/maven-repository-metadata/).

| Improve the handling of http and ftp protocol by the p2 framework.  The following links provide background detail:   * <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-41033> * <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=575688>   Some work has been done to log warnings when the use of http protocol is detected in some limited contexts:  <https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=576428>  Such warnings were considered undesirable in some environments, e.g., inside a corporate firewall, so support was provided to allow logged warnings to be disabled:  [#123](https://github.com/eclipse-equinox/p2/issues/123)  To provide both maximum flexibility and maximum security, we expand the current approach to fully address [CVE-2021-41033](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c5fh-3q27-g4r5 "CVE-2021-41033") and beyond. This description below has been edited to reflect the final design.  We focus on guarding/monitoring p2's transport layer as a whole such that **all** internet access is taken into consideration, including the following mainstream use cases:   * p2 repository content metadata and artifact metadata, composite children, and repository reference URLs, e.g.,   + <https://download.eclipse.org/releases/2023-03/202303151000/p2.index> * mirror server URLs, i.e., the `p2.mirrorsURL` property in the artifact metadata, e.g.,   + <https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?format=xml&file=/releases/2023-03/202303151000> * mirror URLs, e.g.,   + <https://ftp.fau.de/eclipse/releases/2023-03/20230315100> * artifacts URLs, e.g.,   + <https://ftp.fau.de/eclipse/releases/2023-03/202303151000/plugins/bcpg_1.72.2.jar>   There are three modes of http/ftp handling:   1. **allow** `-Dp2.httpRule=allow` `-Dp2.ftpRule=allow`  * This is basically what we have now, i.e., log a warning but allow that warning to be suppressed via `p2.skipRepositoryProtocolCheck`. The warning will be logged for all http/ftp access, not simply once per repository and only for repository URLs.  3. **redirect** `-Dp2.httpRule=redirect` `-Dp2.ftpRule=redirect`  * Any http/ftp URI will be redirected/written to use https/ftps such that no http/ftp request ever reaches out into the network.  5. **block** `-Dp2.httpRule=block` `-Dp2.ftpRule=block`  * Any http/ftp URI will be blocked as if the network were down/inaccessible.   One important question is "what should be the default behavior in the absence of an explicit choice of one of those three"? I propose the framework defaults to **block** http access. Product/application builders (or even users) can then choose whether to **allow** such access or **redirect** such access; they will be alerted to that choice by the exception that blocks the access. (Note that within a corporate firewall, it might well be the case that redirection to https causes failures due to missing root certificates so **allow**, while not ideal, may be needed in some limited environments where security is ensured via external mechanisms.) In the end though, we decided to make **redirect** the default because this is assumed to be what most people will want.  Comments on the proposal are welcome! |

| Any **https** URI will be blocked as if the network were down/inaccessible.  Should it not the other way round ;-)  Maven is blocking http for a while and even though it produce some disturbance it seems people can manage this, so **block** as a default seems suitable to me.  redirect  Probably better "rewrite" as redirection would need to happen on the server side, this seems similar to the "http-only" setting in firefox: <https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/kb/https-only-prefs> |

| Oops. 😜  I edited the original text of fix the for block!  I personally prefer the term redirect because "rewrite" sounds a little more like we might be modify (i.e., literally re-write) the sources of the URLs when we are actually "directing" the underlying transport layer to use https no matter what. The https-only link doesn't use either term. This is more about style/preference rather than substance, so if someone else feels strongly, I have bigger fish to fry. 😛 In the implementation this is controlled by system properties... |

| Well on the transport layer it is actually enforce SSL :-D  Maybe it would then be better to not use such naming as allow / block / ... so maybe more make it more generic as its done with cipher suites to have a blacklist of protocols (!), as for example one might also thing that plain ftp is bad, so maybe like this as a default (**block**):  ``` -Dp2.transport.insecure = warn -Dp2.transport.block = ftp,http  ```  to **allow** but warn:  ``` -Dp2.transport.block =   ```  to allow but do not warn:  ``` -Dp2.transport.insecure = debug -Dp2.transport.block =   ```  And if one really wants redirect  ``` -Dp2.transport.http = redirect  ``` |

Support three modes of http handling:

- allow
  - This is basically what we have now, i.e., log a warning but allow
that warning to be suppressed.  The warning will be logged for all http
access, not simply once per repository and only for repository URLs.
- redirect
  - Any http URI will be redirected/written to use https such that no
http request ever reaches out into the network.
- block
  - Any http URI will be blocked as if the network were
down/inaccessible.

The default behavior is block.

The system property p2.httpAction can be used to configure the behavior.

| One "vague" reason I had for choosing **block** as the default is because this forces people to recognize/notice there is a decision to be made. But I suppose a counter argument is that if 99% of the applications (I made that number up) will want **redirect**, then make that the default. If the SDK, all the EPP packages, and the installer all want to specify **redirect**, it's certainly easier to make that the default.  So if [@jonahgraham](https://github.com/jonahgraham) agrees and no one else objects strongly (with good arguments), I'm happy to change the default...  [@iloveeclipse](https://github.com/iloveeclipse) Maybe you have an opinion about the default? |

| I'm not sure what the effect of "redirect" will be if server doesn't support https - that would lead to an error, right (and this will be OK for me)?  I would assume "redirect" would be a good default because most of proper configured update sites support https, and if not, they could switch to do so and no changes will be needed on user side, so all the "old" update sites that could have been in use will still work without users being forced to do anything. |

| Yes, if the server doesn't support https, there will be an error to that effect. Also, within corporate firewalls, there could be failures because of missing root certificates, which folks sometime avoid by using http, but since most things (touch points) are already specifying https, that's already often an issue. |

| **redirect** as a default is fine by me.  Probably should change the UI to default to `https://` too:  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/679236/226975455-89f9ce98-cc9d-4509-b119-47264f6e5fef.png) |

| One "vague" reason I had for choosing block as the default is because this forces people to recognize/notice there is a decision to be made.  Yes I think this is good, because even today I see a lot of "unsave http" warnings but no one seems to care! Making it default redirect seems not to improve the situation here, so I think it should really not be the default.  Sadly the current implementation is only on the transport level otherwise I could think about something like even asking the user the same way as we ask for certificates:   * Skip the mirror / edit the location * Try https instead * use http even if its unsecure   At least I think (depending on the setting) P2 might want to filter out unsecure mirrors and somehow notify them that they have to upgrade to https, e.g. by getting a list of mirrors that currently use unsafe transports.  For the UI, I think there should be a Warning whenever there is a site added with http and ask the user:   1. Try https instead 2. cancel the operation   It would therefore also be good to ask on start if one wants to convert all http -> https ... |

| It's clear I can't make everyone happy all of the time and it's clear that I do not have time to heat up nor cool down oceans. Prompting users about the protocol is just beyond the scope of what I plan to do. Such URLs can first appear within composites, or from references to other sites, i.e., places where the user just doesn't see where the URL comes from nor can the user change it...  I will change the default to minimize the amount of effort needed by product/application builders and I will address some of the concerns in via:  [#234](https://github.com/eclipse-equinox/p2/pull/234)  As such , both -Dp2.ftpRule and -Dp2httpRule are supported and both are `redirect` by default.  I will not move the logic outside of the transport layer because it's way too likely some caller will overlook: [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/208716/227148859-7c91cff5-95fd-4e25-a31d-21681983abbb.png)  Also , the current implementation is hard coded so there is currently no use case. Should such a use case arise in the future, it can be addressed at that time. |

| You asked for feedback here  Comments on the proposal are welcome!  So I gave my feedback on where I think things *might* be improved, obviously you are free to *ignore* them, *adapt* how you seem best fit or whatever else, so for me its not about making anyone *happy* ...  Also , the current implementation is hard coded so there is currently no use case. Should such a use case arise in the future, it can be addressed at that time.  I think the use-case is already described here (even though that's not necessarily my use case or the eclipse use case), lets say I have **one** site that do not supports https (for whatever reason), this will currently fail unless I allow unsecure access for **every** site. |

### **[Marcono1234](/Marcono1234)** commented [Aug 27, 2021](#issue-981555183)

| Hello, in the recent years supply chain attacks have gotten a lot of attention, and recently Maven got a [CVE with base score 9.1 assigned](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-26291) because it allowed fetching artifacts over (unencrypted) HTTP by default. Newer Maven versions will not download Maven artifacts over unencrypted HTTP anymore by default (see [mailing list post](https://lists.apache.org/thread.html/r0556ce5db7231025785477739ee416b169d8aff5ee9bac7854d64736%40%3Cannounce.apache.org%3E)).  However, this does not seem to affect Tycho / p2 due to its different repository layout (`p2`) and unfortunately using `http` URLs as repository seems to be somewhat common for Tycho users (just have a look at the tests and demos of this project). Please correct me here if Tycho or p2 is providing any additional integrity protection (by default!) for artifacts downloaded over HTTP. Even the p2 files published on the release sites of the Eclipse IDE use HTTP links, e.g. <https://download.eclipse.org/releases/2021-06/202106161001/artifacts.xml.xz> has a HTTP URL as `p2.mirrorsURL`.  Maybe as temporary solution it would therefore be good if Tycho automatically replaced all `http:` repositories the user specifies (or which are used as mirrors) with `https:` and emitted a warning. In the future it might be reasonable to completely disallow `http:` unless the user explicitly enables it in the Maven settings (similar to how Maven handles it now for Maven artifacts).  A similar topic are also mirror sites: Consider for example [this Eclipse list of mirrors](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/download.php?file=/eclipse/updates/3.6/&format=xml). While I don't want to discredit any of the sites, I want to note that I have never heared of some of the companies or universities before. In case there is indeed no additional integrity protection in place (again please correct me if I am wrong here), then this widens the attack surface for an attacker a lot. Also the [Eclipse site for becoming a mirror](https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/mir_request.php) does not mention any security requirements or audits; though I assume the Eclipse Foundation might not have the resources and capacity for this. My main point here is that without any additional protection (enabled by default), mirrors might impose a security risk as well.  What do you think?   ---   Note that this is about supply chain attacks during development and building using Tycho. I am aware that products which use the created bundles (such as Eclipse IDE) may implement additional integrity protection such as signature checks and are therefore not (completely) affected.  Also a workaround can be to specify an internal repository as [Maven repository mirror](https://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html), though this is most likely not an option for small companies or hobby projects.  Mirror settings example ``` <settings>   ...   <mirrors>     <mirror>       <id>internal-repository</id>       <url>https://example.com/repo</url>       <layout>p2</layout>       <mirrorOfLayouts>p2</mirrorOfLayouts>       <mirrorOf>*</mirrorOf>     </mirror>   </mirrors>   ... </settings> ``` |

| Automatically replacing URLs is IMO a bad workaround that would cause confusion. Disabling http p2 repositories by default should forst be considered by p2,; so please open a bug to p2 and then.Tycho will adapt to it when p2 changes the behavior. |

# Equinox/p2/Reporting Problems

< [Equinox](/Equinox "Equinox")‎ | [p2](/Equinox/p2 "Equinox/p2")

## Reporting network connection issues

Connectivity issues are some of the trickiest to report and to track down for us as they often involve some particular network settings that only you have access to.
To help us figure out what is going on the following information is necessary:

* Version of Eclipse (build ID available in Help>About)
* OS
* The URL/URI of the repository you are connecting to and the type of operation you are trying to do (install / uninstall / rollback / update). If you are using the p2 UI, you can copy the repository location from most views.
* JVM version
* Proxy setup from Eclipse
* Proxy setup from the OS
* Information from the Eclipse Error Log

If this information isn't enough for us to diagnose the problem, you will likely be requested to run eclipse in console mode and with special options to get some debug info from the underlying http client.
Here are a few vm arguments to add to your eclipse.ini. Make sure to add those \*after\* the -vmargs argument in the file

From eclipse Kepler on (apache httpclient 4.x):

```
 -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.Log=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.SimpleLog
 -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showdatetime=true
 -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.org.apache.http=DEBUG
 -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.org.apache.http.wire=ERROR

```

For eclipse Juno and older (apache httpclient 3.x):

```
 -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.Log=org.apache.commons.logging.impl.SimpleLog
 -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.showdatetime=true
 -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.httpclient.wire.header=debug
 -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.org.apache.commons.httpclient=debug
 -Dorg.apache.commons.logging.simplelog.log.httpclient.wire=debug

```
## Plug-in installed through the dropins does not install

If a plug-in or a feature that you are installing through the dropins does not install, first here are a few things to check.

* Try to install the software using the p2 UI (Help > Install New Software ...). Failing to install here will provide you with an explanation and you should be able to figure it out
* If the previous install succeeded, verify that the location you are putting the plug-ins in is supported.

When you open a bug, please provide the following information

* + Attach the content of the most recent version of the profile file contained in <eclipseInstall>/p2/org.elipse.equinox.p2.engine/profileRegistry/<profileID>.profile
  + Provide a link where we can get the plug-ins you are trying to install. If they are commercial plug-ins and features, the Manifest.MF and feature.xml would be good enough.

## Computing the explanation for the inability to install software is too slow

Computing the explanation as to why the software is not installable is an NP hard problem and we are always on the look out for test data.
If you have a large setup and the software is failing to install, please open a bug with the following details:

* OS
* JVM version
* Attach the content of the most recent version of the profile file contained in <eclipseInstall>/p2/org.elipse.equinox.p2.engine/profileRegistry/<profileID>.profile
* Indicate the operation you were trying to perform (install / uninstall / update / rollback), which sites you were connecting to, and what software you were installing. The easiest way to capture the sites in your setup is to go to the **Preferences>Install/Update>Available Software Sites**, select all of your sites, and **Export...** the sites to an XML file.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c0)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-31 19:45:24 EDT  ``` Based on [https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c10](show_bug.cgi?id=575688#c10 "CLOSED MOVED - Prevent downloading artifacts over unencrypted HTTP by default")  The page <http://download.eclipse.org/releases/> (and subpages) does not upgrade the request to use HTTPS when accessed using the browser. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c1)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-02 16:22:30 EDT  ``` Also affects <http://download.eclipse.org/technology/> (have edited the title of this report accordingly) ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c2)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-02 16:40:25 EDT  ``` Or maybe this applies to all (?) subpages of the download.eclipse.org subdomain. For example the 404 page for <http://download.eclipse.org/does-not-exist/> does not redirect to HTTPS either. But <http://eclipse.org/does-not-exist/> does perform a redirect. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c3)  Eclipse Webmaster [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-03 14:28:43 EDT  ``` I think it's time to simply redirect all d.e.o traffic from HTTP to HTTPS.  I've submitted a patch to do that which needs internal review before it goes live.  -M. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c4)  Denis Roy [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-03 14:34:54 EDT  ``` *** [Bug 571595](show_bug.cgi?id=571595 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Force https on download.eclipse.or and archive.eclipse.org") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c5)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-04 19:39:00 EDT  ``` (In reply to Denis Roy from [comment #4](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c4)) > *** [Bug 571595](show_bug.cgi?id=571595 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - Force https on download.eclipse.or and archive.eclipse.org") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. ***  That report also mentions archive.eclipse.org; will that be redirected as well in the future? ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c6)  Some User [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-06 07:04:04 EDT  ``` Is looks like subpages of www.eclipse.org and eclipse.org are affected in a similar way. Do you want me to create a separate report for this?  For example opening <http://www.eclipse.org/projects/> or <http://eclipse.org/org/workinggroups/> in a new private browser window does not redirect to HTTPS. However, if you had opened eclipse.org using HTTPS in the past, then you are redirected to HTTPS due to HSTS. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c7)  Eclipse Webmaster [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-14 11:14:47 EDT  ``` The patch has been made live so both downloads and archive should now correctly redirect requests to HTTPS.  -M. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c8)  Mickael Istria [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-09-16 11:59:30 EDT  ``` (In reply to Eclipse Webmaster from [comment #7](show_bug.cgi?id=575731#c7)) > The patch has been made live so both downloads and archive should now > correctly redirect requests to HTTPS.  Thanks for that! ``` |  |

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c0)  Martin Kamp Jensen [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2014-09-17 07:36:40 EDT  ``` download.eclipse.org is only served via HTTP. For security reasons it should also (only?) be served via HTTPS.  We are accessing update sites via download.eclipse.org and need to be sure that we are in fact downloading from download.eclipse.org.  Note that eclipse.org already has a wildcard SSL certificate that can also be used for download.eclipse.org. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c1)  Denis Roy [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2014-09-17 08:35:04 EDT  ``` There are two inherent problems with this:  1. download.e.o moves a _lot_ of traffic.  About 90% of our bandwidth, so I'm not sure what impact this would have on the server's processors. I'm sure it would be maintainable, but I need to approach with caution.  2. Our mirrors do not use https.  If download.e.o supports https and that is viewed as a good thing, folks could stop using mirrors, which will end up costing us a ton more bandwidth.  I'm not opposed to to the idea; au contraire, I agree this should be done, but before flipping the switch I think some investigation needs to be done. ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c2)  Denis Roy [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2014-09-25 13:52:47 EDT  ``` The friends mirror can be used right now to download over https.  Of course, you must become a Friend of Eclipse  :)   <http://friends.eclipse.org/> ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c3)  Richard Birenheide [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2015-03-26 03:30:52 EDT  ``` I'd support Martin strongly for the following reason:  When using tycho for Eclipse Maven builds one has to to specify a target platform to compile against. Unfortunately I could not dig up a Nexus repository to build against (which typically serve via https), eg. for Luna, therefore I have to resort to a target definition pointing to download.eclipse.org. For build integrity reasons it would be good to be able to fetch via https.  N.B. Ideal solution for my problem would be to have product builds in central Maven but I am not sure if this is the right place to offload this.  Some opinions on SSL cost: <https://www.imperialviolet.org/2010/06/25/overclocking-ssl.html> <https://www.imperialviolet.org/2011/02/06/stillinexpensive.html> ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c4)  Denis Roy [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2015-03-30 16:00:48 EDT  ``` (In reply to Richard Birenheide from [comment #3](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c3)) > Some opinions on SSL cost:  You may have missed [comment #1](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c1).  About 90% of Eclipse's bandwidth needs are handled by our free mirror sites, most/all of which do not support SSL.  So although the cost of using SSL for download.eclipse.org traffic may seem negligible, the cost of supporting all our downloads on SSL is quite gigantic.  And if we enable SSL on download.eclipse.org there will be increased incentive to use it instead of the mirrors. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c5)  Denis Roy [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2015-04-17 09:16:08 EDT  ``` *** [Bug 464884](show_bug.cgi?id=464884 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - https://download.eclipse.org/eclipse/downloads/ not reachable any more via https") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c6)  Dzmitry Lazerka [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2016-03-09 14:38:53 EST  ``` Couple of ideas on resolving this issue: 1. Can we force/recommend/create incentive for the mirrors to use HTTPS as well? 2. Serve at least checksums over HTTPS. 3. Add digital signature. Even over HTTP it cannot be faked. 4. Don't serve downloads through main site at all, only checksums.  Some projects learned importance of serving downloads over HTTPS the hard way. For example, Linux Mint was recently breached, and after that they moved to HTTPS -only. They don't serve their downloads at all, only through mirrors, but they serve checksums over HTTPS.  And in general, idea "We don't improve our website because users would start using it more" sounds strange to me. ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c7)  Richard Birenheide [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2016-03-10 03:44:07 EST  ``` I'd second Dzmitry strongly here. Maybe one can point mirrors to <https://letsencrypt.org/>. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c8)  Denis Roy [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2016-03-11 12:30:43 EST  ``` (In reply to Dzmitry Lazerka from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c6)) > Couple of ideas on resolving this issue: > 1.

Don't serve downloads through main site at all, only checksums.  We have a central checksum service on [HTTPS://www.eclipse.org](https://www.eclipse.org) If you see some projects not using it, they should. We don't require it.  > And in general, idea "We don't improve our website because users would start > using it more" sounds strange to me.  It should sound strange since that is not what I said. :) ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c9)  Demi Obenour [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2016-08-31 14:29:50 EDT  ``` If download.eclipse.org cannot be served over HTTPS, the best alternative is to have a small download script be downloaded from <https://eclipse.org>, and have this script (which includes an embedded SHA256/SHA384/SHA512/Blake2b/Skein/etc hash, but not MD5 or SHA1 which are insecure) do the actual downloading.  It is important that the process of checking the hash be automated.  Also, I think that all downloads from Eclipse should be digitally signed, and that all tools that download from Eclipse should verify the digital signature.  This includes e.g. the Eclipse IDE.  This is really the only solution in the presence of mirrors. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c10)  Mykola Nikishov [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2016-10-26 04:41:31 EDT  ``` (In reply to Dzmitry Lazerka from [comment #6](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c6))  > Couple of ideas on resolving this issue: > 2. Serve at least checksums over HTTPS.  It is the easiest way to go - start serving p2 metadata files only over HTTPS. Unfortunately, the whole checksum story is kind a broken:  - the only message digest algo supported by p2 is MD5 - MD5 is broken for quite a some time - current support for checksums in p2 makes it hard to support new   message digest algorithms - MD5 generation was broken in Tycho, forcing people to disable   checksum generation/consumption completely. See [bug #357513](show_bug.cgi?id=357513 "RESOLVED FIXED - 'download.md5' property missing in artifact repository produced by eclipse-repository") for   details, fortunately it has been fixed 2 weeks ago.  I'm trying to address p2-related side in [bug #423715](show_bug.cgi?id=423715 "RESOLVED FIXED - Add SHA256 to p2 metadata publishing (and prefer for consumption if available)"). Once it is done, it will make sense to serve p2 metadata only over HTTPS.  On the other hand, I was told that with the new hardware for download.eclipse.org EF will have enough machine power to switch the whole download.eclipse.org to HTTPS. ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c11)  Pascal Rapicault [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2016-12-16 09:13:07 EST  ``` (In reply to Martin Kamp Jensen from [comment #0](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c0)) > download.eclipse.org is only served via HTTP.

Could you please highlight the specific security problems you are trying to solve that are not solved by having all the Jars from the release repo be signed? ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c12)  Pascal Rapicault [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2016-12-16 09:18:27 EST  ``` > - the only message digest algo supported by p2 is MD5 > - MD5 is broken for quite a some time      Could you please indicate with specific aspect is broken?  > - MD5 generation was broken in Tycho, forcing people to disable >   checksum generation/consumption completely.

Two things: 1) Even though Tycho was not generating the checksums, other tools were able to generate the MD5 and insert those into the artifacts.xml.      2) For the Eclipse release train where all the artifacts are signed, the absence of checksum is not an issue since the signature is checked at download time. ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c13)  Mykola Nikishov [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2016-12-28 12:04:38 EST  ``` (In reply to Pascal Rapicault from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c12)) > > - the only message digest algo supported by p2 is MD5 > > - MD5 is broken for quite a some time >      Could you please indicate with specific aspect is broken?

Every unencrypted HTTP request reveals information about a user’s behavior, and the interception and tracking of unencrypted browsing has become commonplace.  Today, there is no such thing as non-sensitive web traffic, and public services should not depend on the benevolence of network operators.  When properly configured, HTTPS can provide a fast, secure connection that offers the level of privacy and reliability that users should expect from government web services.  <https://https.cio.gov/everything/> ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c15)  David Williams [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-05-19 15:18:18 EDT  ``` See also 435426 for related. ```  [Comment 16](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c16)  Gunnar Wagenknecht [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-08-02 14:43:59 EDT  ``` *** [Bug 509332](show_bug.cgi?id=509332 "CLOSED DUPLICATE - downloads.eclipse.org https support broken") has been marked as a duplicate of this bug. *** ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c17)  Gunnar Wagenknecht [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-08-02 14:45:53 EDT  ``` Created [attachment 275245](attachment.cgi?id=275245 "\"not secure\" branding") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=275245&action=edit "\"not secure\" branding") "not secure" branding  With the latest Chrome version, Eclipse downloads are now officially branded as "Not Secure". ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c18)  Gunnar Wagenknecht [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-08-02 14:49:12 EDT  ``` (moving to Website and removing unrelated dependencies)  I'm increasing the severity of this issue because at this point, download.eclipse.org is not even reachable via https, i.e. it's impossible to transfer checksums over an integral, secure connection. IMHO this should have a higher priority.   What is the current plan to provide https for d.e.o.? Do the concerns from 2014 still apply? ```  [Comment 19](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c19)  Denis Roy [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-11-07 11:45:19 EST  ``` <https://download.eclipse.org> for the first time. ```  [Comment 20](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c20)  Denis Roy [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2018-11-13 09:27:53 EST  ``` This has been implemented. ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c21)  Jonathan Leitschuh [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-09-11 18:13:25 EDT  ``` Hi Eclipse Team,  I'm reaching out asking for your support on the initiative to formally deprecate the download of dependencies over HTTP by January 15th, 2020.  The full scope of my research is captured in this article I published on June 10th titled 'Want to take over the Java ecosystem? All you need is a MITM!'  <https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/want-to-take-over-the-java-ecosystem-all-you-need-is-a-mitm-1fc329d898fb?source=friends_link&sk=3c99970c55a899ad9ef41f126efcde0e>   As a part of this research project I reached out to some of the most used artifact server owners in our industry: Sonatype of Maven Central, Pivotal of Spring, RedHat, and JFrog of JCenter bintray. I discussed with them that one way to resolve this issue is to shut down the HTTP (port 80) endpoint, thus breaking insecure builds that could be maliciously compromised.  Sonatype agreed to this and will moving forward with the depreciation on January 15th, 2020. <https://central.sonatype.org/articles/2019/Apr/30/http-access-to-repo1mavenorg-and-repomavenapacheorg-is-being-deprecated/> JFrog has also agreed to also do this, as has Pivotal.  I would appreciate it if the Eclipse Foundation followed the rest of the industry in this initiative and formally deprecated the HTTP port for download.eclipse.org and any/all other artifact servers operated by the Eclipse Foundation.  If the Eclipse foundation will publish a blog post about joining this initiative, I'm happy to include a link to it in the Gradle 6.0 release notes. ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=444350#c22)  Mikaël Barbero [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2019-09-12 03:40:34 EDT  ``` Jonahtan, this ticket (about enabling https) has been resolved. Please open a new one if you want to discuss the deprecation of http. Thanks. ``` |  |

# Release Notes – Maven 3.8.1

The Apache Maven team would like to announce the release of Maven 3.8.1.

Maven 3.8.1 is [available for download](../../download.html).

Maven is a software project management and comprehension tool. Based on the concept of a project object model (POM), Maven can manage a project's build, reporting, and documentation from a central place.

The core release is independent of plugin releases. Further releases of plugins will be made separately. See the [PluginList](../../plugins/index.html) for more information.

If you have any questions, please consult:

* the web site: <https://maven.apache.org/>
* the maven-user mailing list: [https://maven.apache.org/mailing-lists.html](/mailing-lists.html)
* the reference documentation: [https://maven.apache.org/ref/3.8.1/](/ref/3.8.1/)

## Overview about the changes

This release covers two CVEs:

### CVE-2021-26291

We received a report from Jonathan Leitschuh about a vulnerability of custom repositories in dependency POMs.
We've split this up into three separate issues:

* Possible Man-In-The-Middle-Attack due to custom repositories using HTTP

  More and more repositories use HTTPS nowadays, but this hasn't always been the case. This means that Maven Central contains POMs with custom repositories that refer to a URL over HTTP.
  This makes downloads via such repository a target for a MITM attack.
  At the same time, developers are probably not aware that for some downloads an insecure URL is being used.
  Because uploaded POMs to Maven Central are immutable, a change for Maven was required.
  To solve this, we extended the mirror configuration with `<blocked>` parameter,
  and we added a new `external:http:*` mirror selector (like existing `external:*`), meaning “any external URL using HTTP”.

  The decision was made to block such external HTTP repositories by default: this is done by providing a mirror in the `conf/settings.xml` blocking insecure HTTP external URLs.
* Possible Domain Hijacking due to custom repositories using abandoned domains

  Sonatype has analyzed which domains were abandoned and has claimed these domains.
* Possible hijacking of downloads by redirecting to custom repositories

  This one was the hardest to analyze and explain. The short story is: you're safe, dependencies are only downloaded from repositories within their context.
  So there are two main questions: what is the context and what is the order?
  The order is described on the [Repository Order](/guides/mini/guide-multiple-repositories.html#repository-order) page.
  The first group of repositories are defined in the settings.xml (both user and global).
  The second group of repositories are based on inheritence, with ultimately the super POM containing the URL to Maven Central.
  The third group is the most complex one but is important to understand the term context: repositories from the effective POMs from the dependency path to the artifact.
  So if a dependency was defined by another dependency or by a Maven project, it will also include their repositories.
  In the end this is not a bug, but a design feature.
### CVE-2020-13956

Apache HttpClient is a transitive dependency of Maven Resolver via Maven Wagon, so we've updated those versions as part of this release.

## Why does this version have the value 3.8.1?

* Why not 3.6.4?

  This is not just a bugfix as it contains three features that **cause a change of default behavior** (external HTTP insecure URLs are now blocked by default):
  your builds may fail when using this new Maven release, if you use now blocked repositories. Please check and eventually fix before upgrading.
* Why not 3.7.0?

  Apache Maven 3.7.0 has been advertised in the past that it would be the first release where you could optionally activate the build/consumer feature:
  the version containing this feature has been renamed to 4.0.0.
  Reusing 3.7.0 might lead to confusion, hence we picked the next available minor version.
* Why not 3.8.0?

  With every release there's a 72h+ voting period. During the vote of 3.8.0 a bug was discovered, one that was important enough to cancel the vote.
  With Maven we burn versions, to ensure we're always talking about the same “version”. This way there will be never confusion about which Maven 3.8.0 one was using.
## How to fix when I get a HTTP repository blocked?

If the repository is defined in your `pom.xml`, please fix it in your source code.

If the repository is defined in one of your dependencies POM, you'll get a message like:

```
[ERROR] Failed to execute goal on project test: Could not resolve dependencies for project xxx: Failed to collect dependencies at my.test:dependency:version -> my.test.transitive:transitive:version: Failed to read artifact descriptor for my.test.transitive:transitive:jar:version: Could not transfer artifact my.test.transitive:transitive:pom:version from/to maven-default-http-blocker (http://0.0.0.0/): Blocked mirror for repositories: [blocked-repository-id (http://blocked.repository.org, default, releases+snapshots)]

```

Options to fix are:

* upgrade the dependency version to a newer version that replaced the obsolete HTTP repository URL with a HTTPS one,
* keep the dependency version but [define a mirror in your settings](/guides/mini/guide-mirror-settings.html).
## The detailed issue list

Bug

```
    [MNG-7128] - improve error message when blocked repository defined in build POM

```

New Feature

```
    [MNG-7116] - Add support for mirror selector on external:http:*
    [MNG-7117] - Add support for blocking mirrors

```

Dependency upgrade

```
    [MNG-7119] - Upgrade Maven Wagon to 3.4.3
    [MNG-7123] - Upgrade Maven Resolver to 1.6.2

```

# The Central Repository is moving to HTTPS

December 20, 2019

As stewards of [Maven Central](https://central.sonatype.com/), Sonatype is responsible for hosting and transmitting a disproportionately high volume of the Java ecosystem's open source components. In the month of November 2019 alone, total requests to Maven Central across North America and Europe alone reached 21 billion, with just under 2 petabytes of data transferred to our end users.

Beginning January 15, 2020, [the Central Repository](https://central.sonatype.org/) will no longer support communication over HTTP. Any attempts to access **http://repo1.maven.org** and **http://repo.maven.apache.org/** will result in an error, and users will need to update their builds to resolve dependencies over HTTPS. Additionally, proxy repository remote URLs for your repository manager will also need to be updated to reflect the change to HTTPS.

## Upgrading to HTTPS on January 15

Since the inception of Maven Central, data integrity is something we've historically taken very seriously beginning with the introduction of strict requirements for SHA-1 and MD5 checksums, to PGP signatures for assuring provenance. More recently we've introduced changes to deprecate known insecure versions of common security protocols such as TLSv1.1.

The natural continuation of this journey begins next month on **January 15, 2020** when we will begin to enforce the use of HTTPS for all consumers of content from Maven Central. The resolution of dependencies over HTTP presents numerous [security concerns](https://medium.com/bugbountywriteup/want-to-take-over-the-java-ecosystem-all-you-need-is-a-mitm-1fc329d898fb), namely exposing development teams to man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks in which malicious code is injected into dependencies during the build phase, thereby infecting the downstream components and ultimately their end-users. This vulnerability has become obvious to many who have already adopted HTTPS for the dependency resolution phase of their software build process.

In November 2019, 79% of all requests to Central were already made over HTTPS, with 21% still using insecure HTTP (down from 25% when this change was first [announced](https://central.sonatype.org/articles/2019/Apr/30/http-access-to-repo1mavenorg-and-repomavenapacheorg-is-being-deprecated/) in April 2019).

We would like to credit [Jonathan Leitschuh](https://www.linkedin.com/in/jonathan-leitschuh-94553661/) for pushing this initiative across the ecosystem. As he writes:

HTTPS doesn't just encrypt the traffic between the client and the server, it also provides a cryptographic guarantee that the client is communicating with the server requested and not a MITM imposter.

You can read his full writeup [here.](https://medium.com/%40jonathan.leitschuh/want-to-take-over-the-java-ecosystem-all-you-need-is-a-mitm-1fc329d898fb)

## Benefits to upgrading to HTTPS

While the transition to HTTPS may cause disruption for the minority of our users still using HTTP, we believe the time to making the switch to encryption is now for the greater benefit of the open source community. We strongly encourage our users to make this transition well in advance of January 15, 2020 to avoid any potential disruption. If your environment does not support HTTPS, see below.

Despite the actions taken to provide a safe, secure environment for the distribution of open source code, no build process should directly rely on large community OSS projects, even Maven Central. Make sure you're using a caching proxy such as [Sonatype Nexus Repository](/products/sonatype-nexus-repository) to warehouse the components that have already met your organization's standards for component integrity and furthermore provide greater resiliency for your build process.

We would like to extend our thanks to John Leitschuh for his leadership and dedication to the ongoing effort towards securing open source.

### My environment does not support HTTPS, what can I do?

We recognize that for some of our users, there may be major technical limitations that prohibit making the switch to HTTPS, e.g. build environments still running JDK6. For those users, we have provided a separate domain to accommodate insecure traffic at [http://insecure.repo1.maven.org](http://insecure.repo1.maven.org/). Make sure to replace all your existing references to [http://repo1.maven.org](http://repo1.maven.org/) or <http://repo.maven.apache.org/> with this URL prior to the January 15 cutover date.

You can check out our [FAQ Page](https://central.sonatype.org/category/faq.html) or follow [@sonatype\_ops](https://twitter.com/sonatype_ops) on Twitter for a more detailed schedule of changes as we get closer to January 15, 2020.
