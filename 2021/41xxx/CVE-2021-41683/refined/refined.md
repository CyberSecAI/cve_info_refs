Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack overflow due to a recursive call within the `ecma_get_lex_env_type` function. This function is called during the resolution of references.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stack overflow caused by unbounded recursion. The provided test case shows that the `Foo` constructor calls itself recursively, leading to a stack overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact of this vulnerability is a denial of service due to a stack overflow, which terminates the program execution and crashes the application. The AddressSanitizer output confirms the crash due to stack exhaustion.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the execution of JavaScript code that contains a recursive function call. The provided example code demonstrates a simple way to trigger the stack overflow. The recursive call of the `Foo` constructor causes the stack to grow without bound until overflow occurs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the vulnerable JerryScript environment. This is a common position for an attacker in scenarios where the JavaScript engine is used to process untrusted user-provided code.

The provided content gives more detail than a basic CVE description would, specifically:

*   The exact function (`ecma_get_lex_env_type`) and the code locations in the JerryScript source code that trigger the crash
*   The specific build and test environment used to discover the vulnerability
*   The output of AddressSanitizer, including the stack trace
*   A minimal example code that triggers the stack overflow.
