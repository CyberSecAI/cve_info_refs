Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-41035:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Eclipse OpenJ9 handles method handles (`MethodHandles`) created using `Lookup.findVirtual` when invoking non-public (inaccessible) interface methods.  Specifically, the JVM fails to throw an `IllegalAccessError` when a `MethodHandle` attempts to invoke an interface method that is not accessible to the caller.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Access Control:** The primary weakness is that `MethodHandles` obtained via `Lookup.findVirtual` are allowed to bypass normal access controls for interface methods.  This allows access to methods that should be restricted (private or package-private methods).
- **Bypassing Expected Behavior:** The interface dispatch implemented by `InterfaceHandle` is supposed to throw `IllegalAccessError (IAE)` when the dispatched callee is not public, similar to `invokeinterface`. This expected behavior was not being enforced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Access to Inaccessible Methods:** An attacker could potentially invoke non-public interface methods, leading to unexpected behavior or potentially exposing sensitive data or functionality.
- **Violation of Encapsulation:** The vulnerability breaks the intended encapsulation of interface methods.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, the ability to bypass access controls could potentially lead to more severe exploits if the attacker can manipulate these methods to execute arbitrary code.
- **Information Disclosure**: Sensitive information might be exposed if an inaccessible method gives access to it.
- **Data Modification**: The attacker could potentially modify data if an inaccessible method permits such action.
- **Denial of Service**: The attacker could potentially cause a denial of service by invoking inaccessible methods that are not designed for general usage and could lead to unexpected errors.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the use of `MethodHandles` created with `Lookup.findVirtual`.
- An attacker with the ability to create and invoke such method handles could trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to create `MethodHandles` using `Lookup.findVirtual` within the context of the affected OpenJ9 JVM.
- The attacker also needs to be able to call these `MethodHandles` which then attempt to access inaccessible interface methods.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability specifically affects the way OpenJ9 handles virtual method lookups for interfaces, as the vTable is used and private methods are not present in vTable, the check for `J9AccPrivate` is not required.
*   The fix involves ensuring that an `IllegalAccessError` is thrown when a `MethodHandle` attempts to invoke a non-public interface method.
*   The issue was fixed in OpenJ9 version 0.29.0.
*   NetApp products that incorporate IBM Cognos Analytics are also affected.
*   The vulnerability is tracked by Eclipse Bugzilla as bug 576395.
