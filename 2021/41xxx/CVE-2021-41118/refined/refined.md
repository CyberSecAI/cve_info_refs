Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-41118.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause:** The vulnerability stems from unsanitized input of regular expression dates within the parameters of the DynamicPageList3 (DPL) parser function.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The primary vulnerability is a ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) vulnerability. This occurs because the DPL extension does not properly sanitize regular expression inputs related to dates, allowing an attacker to craft malicious input that can cause the regex engine to get stuck processing it, causing a denial of service.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service condition, making the affected MediaWiki instance unavailable.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker could send crafted requests containing malicious date patterns to the DPL parser function.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker does not require any privileges.
    *   The attacker requires user interaction.
    *   The attack complexity is high.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects versions of DynamicPageList3 up to and including 3.3.5.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.3.6 of the extension.
*   Workarounds include setting `$wgDplSettings['functionalRichness'] = 0;` or disabling DynamicPageList3.
*   The vulnerability is assigned a moderate severity and a CVSS score of 5.3. The CVSS vector is `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`
*   The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-400.
