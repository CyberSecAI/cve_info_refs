Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Tuleap application fails to properly sanitize user inputs when constructing SQL queries for browsing and searching revisions in CVS repositories.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection (CWE-89):**  User-supplied input used to order the results of a CVS revision search is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The same unsanitized user input used for the SQL injection can also be used to inject Javascript into the page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **SQL Injection:** An attacker with read access to a CVS repository can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- **Reflected XSS:** Attacker can inject malicious scripts into the page, allowing them to perform actions on behalf of a user viewing the crafted page.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- The primary attack vector is through the `morder` GET parameter, which is used to control the order of results in the CVS revision browser. By injecting malicious SQL into this parameter, an attacker can manipulate the generated SQL query.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Low privileges:** The attacker only needs read access to a CVS repository.
- **No user interaction:** Exploitation does not require any user interaction.
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests with modified parameters to the vulnerable application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered in the CVS revision browser of Tuleap.
- The provided commit diffs show the changes made to fix the vulnerability, specifically around how the `morder` parameter is handled in `src/www/cvs/browse_commit.php` and `src/www/cvs/commit_utils.php`.
- The fix involves sanitizing the input using `Codendi_HTMLPurifier` and changing the way the order by clause is constructed in `commit_criteria_list_to_query`.
- The vulnerability is assigned a high severity score of 8.8 based on CVSS v3.1 metrics.
- The vulnerability affects multiple versions of Tuleap.
- The fix is available in Tuleap Community Edition 11.17.99.146 and Tuleap Enterprise Edition 11.17-5, and 11.16-7
