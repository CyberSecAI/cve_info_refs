Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-41248:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `graphiql` application's improper handling of GraphQL schema introspection responses or schema prop values. Specifically, it fails to sanitize or escape malicious GraphQL type names when rendering them in the UI, leading to a dynamic XSS attack surface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XSS Vulnerability:** The core issue is an XSS vulnerability caused by the direct interpolation of potentially malicious GraphQL type names into HTML using the `innerHTML` API without proper escaping.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not adequately sanitize or validate the type names received from the GraphQL server.
- **Inadequate Markdown Handling:** While `markdown-it` was used for rendering markdown, there was a component using `marked`, and it wasn't properly sanitized.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the user's browser session by providing a malicious schema with specially crafted type names.
- **Data Exfiltration:** This allows the attacker to potentially steal user credentials, session data, or other sensitive information by running malicious scripts.
- **Phishing Attacks:** Custom implementations of `graphiql` that allow dynamic setting of the schema URL are highly vulnerable to phishing attacks, as a malicious URL could lead to exploitation.
- **Arbitrary Actions:** The injected code could perform any action that the user can perform within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Compromised Introspection Response:** The attacker could compromise the GraphQL server, injecting malicious names into the introspection schema response.
- **Malicious Schema Prop:** The attacker could provide a malicious schema as a value to the `schema` prop in `graphiql`.
- **Custom Implementations:** If a `graphiql` implementation allows dynamic control of the GraphQL endpoint (e.g., via query parameters like `?endpoint=`), the attacker can provide a malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the GraphQL schema or the server from which the `graphiql` instance fetches the schema.
- The attacker needs a way to entice the user to load the malicious schema in the `graphiql` application. This could be via a phishing attack, or another mechanism.
- No user privileges are needed, only user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability exists due to using `innerHTML` to render type names.
- The fix involved HTML escaping text in the vulnerable component and validating the schema upon receiving introspection response.
- The vulnerability was present since the first commit of GraphiQL.

The provided content also highlights the defense-in-depth approach taken to fix the issue, including HTML escaping, schema validation, and ensuring the safe rendering of user-generated HTML, specifically markdown.

The github commit also provides a specific example of a compromised introspection schema.
```json
{
    "kind": "OBJECT",
    "name": "<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>",
    "description": null,
    "fields": [
        {
            "name": "name",
            "description": null,
            "args": [],
            "type": {
                "kind": "NON_NULL",
                "name": null,
                "ofType": {
                    "kind": "SCALAR",
                    "name": "String",
                    "ofType": null
                }
            },
            "isDeprecated": false,
            "deprecationReason": null
        }
    ],
    "inputFields": null,
    "interfaces": [],
    "enumValues": null,
    "possibleTypes": null
}
```
This shows an example of the vulnerability, where the `name` attribute is set to an html tag that will trigger an alert if rendered.
