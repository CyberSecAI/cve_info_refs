This is a security advisory for an XSS vulnerability in `graphiql`.

A similar vulnerability affects `graphql-playground`, a fork of `graphiql`. There is a corresponding `graphql-playground` [advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7) and [Apollo Server advisory](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7x-rc44-rrqw).

## 1. Impact

All versions of `graphiql` older than [`graphiql@1.4.7`](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/releases/tag/v1.4.7) are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or `schema` prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete.

In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in `graphiql`. There are a number of ways that can occur.

By default, the schema URL is *not* attacker-controllable in `graphiql` or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors.

If a custom implementation of `graphiql`'s `fetcher` allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like `?endpoint=` in `graphql-playground`, or a database provided value, then this custom `graphiql` implementation is *vulnerable to phishing attacks*, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL.

Because this exposes an XSS attack surface, it would be possible for a threat actor to exfiltrate user credentials, data, etc. using arbitrary malicious scripts, without it being known to the user.

## 2. Scope

This advisory describes the impact on the `graphiql` package. The vulnerability also affects other projects forked from `graphiql` such as [`graphql-playground`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7) and the `graphql-playground` fork distributed by Apollo Server. The impact is more severe in the `graphql-playground` implementations; see the [`graphql-playground` advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7) and [Apollo Server advisory](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7x-rc44-rrqw) for details.

This vulnerability does not impact `codemirror-graphql`, `monaco-graphql` or other dependents, as it exists in `onHasCompletion.ts` in `graphiql`. It does impact all forks of `graphiql`, and every released version of `graphiql`.

It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this.

## 3. Patches

`graphiql@1.4.7` addresses this issue via defense in depth.

* **HTML-escaping text** that should be treated as text rather than HTML. In most of the app, this happens automatically because React escapes all interpolated text by default. However, one vulnerable component uses the unsafe `innerHTML` API and interpolated type names directly into HTML. We now properly escape that type name, which fixes the known vulnerability.
* **Validates the schema** upon receiving the introspection response or schema changes. Schemas with names that violate the GraphQL spec will no longer be loaded. (This includes preventing the Doc Explorer from loading.) This change is also sufficient to fix the known vulnerability. You can disable this validation by setting `dangerouslyAssumeSchemaIsValid={true}`, which means you are relying only on escaping values to protect you from this attack.
* **Ensuring that user-generated HTML is safe**. Schemas can contain Markdown in `description` and `deprecationReason` fields, and the web app renders them to HTML using the `markdown-it` library. As part of the development of `graphiql@1.4.7`, we verified that our use of `markdown-it` prevents the inclusion of arbitrary HTML. We use `markdown-it` without setting `html: true`, so we are comfortable relying on [`markdown-it`'s HTML escaping](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/security.md) here. We considered running a second level of sanitization over all rendered Markdown using a library such as `dompurify` but believe that is unnecessary as `markdown-it`'s sanitization appears to be adequate. `graphiql@1.4.7` does update to the latest version of `markdown-it` (v12, from v10) so that any security fixes in v11 and v12 will take effect.

### 3.1 CDN bundle implementations may be automatically patched

Note that if your implementation is depending on a CDN version of `graphiql`, and is pointed to the `latest` tag (usually the default for most cdns if no version is specified) then this issue is already mitigated, in case you were vulnerable to it before.

## 4. Workarounds for Older Versions

If you cannot use `graphiql@1.4.7` or later

* Always use a static URL to a trusted server that is serving a trusted GraphQL schema.
* If you have a custom implementation that allows using user-provided schema URLs via a query parameter, database value, etc, you must either disable this customization, or only allow trusted URLs.

## 5. How to Re-create the Exploit

You can see an example on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/graphiql-xss-exploit-gr22f?file=/src/App.js). These are both fixed to the last `graphiql` release `1.4.6` which is the last vulnerable release; however it would work with any previous release of `graphiql`.

Both of these examples are meant to demonstrate the phishing attack surface, so they are customized to accept a `url` parameter. To demonstrate the phishing attack, add `?url=https://graphql-xss-schema.netlify.app/graphql` to the in-codesandbox browser.

Erase the contents of the given query and type `{u`. You will see an alert window open, showing that attacker-controlled code was executed.

Note that when React is in development mode, a validation exception is thrown visibly; however that exception is usually buried in the browser console in a production build of `graphiql`. This validation exception comes from `getDiagnostics`, which invokes `graphql` `validate()` which in turn will `assertValidSchema()`, as `apollo-server-core` does on executing each operation. This validation does not prevent the exploit from being successful.

Note that something like the `url` parameter is not required for the attack to happen if `graphiql`'s `fetcher` is configured in a different way to communicate with a compromised GraphQL server.

## GraphQL Playground introspection schema template injection attack: Advisory Statement

This is a security advisory for an XSS vulnerability in `graphql-playground`.

A similar vulnerability affects `graphiql`, the package from which `graphql-playground` was forked. There is a corresponding `graphiql` [advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8).

* [6. For more information](#6-for-more-information)

### 1. Impact

All versions of `graphql-playground-react` older than `graphql-playground-react@1.7.28` are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or `schema` prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete.

In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a malicious schema in `graphql-playground`. There are several ways this can occur, including by specifying the URL to a malicious schema in the `endpoint` query parameter. If a user clicks on a link to a GraphQL Playground installation that specifies a malicious server, arbitrary JavaScript can run in the user's browser, which can be used to exfiltrate user credentials or other harmful goals.

### 2. Scope

This advisory describes the impact on the `graphql-playground-react` package. The vulnerability also affects `graphiql`, the package from which `graphql-playground` was forked, with a less severe impact; see the [`graphiql` advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/security/advisories/GHSA-x4r7-m2q9-69c8) for details. It affects all versions of `graphql-playground-react` older than `v1.7.28`.

This vulnerability was introduced with the first public release of `graphql-playground`, so it impacts both the original legacy `graphql-playground` and the contemporary `graphql-playground-react` npm package. It is most easily exploited on `graphql-playground-react@1.7.0` and newer, as that release added functionality which made it possible to override the endpoint URL via query parameter even if it is explicitly specified in the code.

`graphql-playground-react` is commonly loaded via the `graphql-playground-html` package or a middleware package that wraps it (`graphql-playground-express`, `graphql-playground-middleware-koa`, `graphql-playground-middleware-hapi`, or `graphql-playground-middleware-lambda`). By default, these packages render an HTML page which loads the *latest* version of `graphql-playground-react` through a CDN. If you are using one of these packages to install GraphQL Playground on your domain *and you do not explicitly pass the `version` option to `renderPlaygroundPage` or the middleware function*, then you do not need to take any action to resolve this vulnerability, as the latest version of the React app will automatically be loaded.

`graphql-playground-react` is also commonly loaded via HTML served by Apollo Server. Apollo Server always pins a specific version of `graphql-playground-react`, so if you are using Apollo Server you do need to take action to resolve this vulnerability. See the [Apollo Server advisory](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7x-rc44-rrqw) for details.

### 3. Patches

`graphql-playground-react@1.7.28` addresses this issue via defense in depth:

* **HTML-escaping text** that should be treated as text rather than HTML. In most of the app, this happens automatically because React escapes all interpolated text by default. However, one vulnerable component uses the unsafe `innerHTML` API and interpolated type names directly into HTML. We now properly escape that type name, which fixes the known vulnerability.
* **Validates the schema** upon receiving the introspection response or schema changes. Schemas with names that violate the GraphQL spec will no longer be loaded. (This includes preventing the Doc Explorer from loading.) This change is also sufficient to fix the known vulnerability.
* **Ensuring that user-generated HTML is safe**. Schemas can contain Markdown in `description` and `deprecationReason` fields, and the web app renders them to HTML using the `markdown-it` library. Prior to `graphql-playground-react@1.7.28`, GraphQL Playground used two separate libraries to render Markdown: `markdown-it` and `marked`. As part of the development of `graphql-playground-react@1.7.28`, we verified that our use of `markdown-it` prevents the inclusion of arbitrary HTML. We use `markdown-it` without setting `html: true`, so we are comfortable relying on [`markdown-it`'s HTML escaping](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/security.md) here. We considered running a second level of sanitization over all rendered Markdown using a library such as `dompurify` but believe that is unnecessary as `markdown-it`'s sanitization appears to be adequate. `graphiql@1.4.3` does update to the latest version of `markdown-it` (v12, from v10) so that any security fixes in v11 and v12 will take effect. On the other hand, [`marked`](https://github.com/markedjs/marked) recommends the use of a separate HTML sanitizer if its input is untrusted. In this release, we switch the one component which uses `marked` to use `markdown-it` like the rest of the app.

**If you are using `graphql-playground-react` directly in your client app**, upgrade to version 1.7.28 or later.

**If you are using `graphql-playground-html` or a package which starts with `graphql-playground-middleware-` in your server** and you are passing the `version` option to a function imported from that package, change that `version` option to be at least `"1.7.28"`.

**If you are using `graphql-playground-html` or a package which starts with `graphql-playground-middleware-` in your server** and you are **NOT** passing the `version` option to a function imported from that package, no action is necessary; your app automatically loads the latest version of `graphql-playground-react` from CDN.

### 4. Reproducing the exploit

We are hosting a "malicious" server at <https://graphql-xss-schema.netlify.app/graphql> . This server has a hard-coded introspection result that includes unsafe HTML in type names.

If you manually change a GraphQL Playground installation to use that endpoint, clear the operation pane, and type `{x` into the operation pane, an alert will pop up; this demonstrates execution of code provided by the malicious server.

An URL like <https://YOUR-PLAYGROUND-SERVER/?endpoint=https%3A%2F%2Fgraphql-xss-schema.netlify.app%2Fgraphql&query=%7B> will load already configured with the endpoint in question. (This URL-based exploit works on `graphql-playground-react@1.7.0` and newer; older versions may be protected from this particular URL-based exploit depending on their configuration.)

This change fixes an XSS vulnerability that has been present since the first
commit of GraphiQL when used with an untrusted GraphQL server. It applies three
strategies to fix via defense-in-depth: HTML escaping a string in a contexts
that uses innerHTML; validating incoming schemas with graphql-js validateSchema;
and updating markdown-it to the latest version.

See docs/security/2021-introspection-schema-xss.md for more details.

|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## 1. GraphiQL introspection schema template injection attack: Advisory Statement |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This is a security advisory for an XSS vulnerability in `graphiql`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | A similar vulnerability affects `graphql-playground`, a fork of `graphiql`. There is a corresponding `graphql-playground` [advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7) and [Apollo Server advisory](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7x-rc44-rrqw). |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### 1.1. Impact |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | All versions of `graphiql` older than [`graphiql@1.4.3`](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/releases/tag/v1.4.3) are vulnerable to compromised HTTP schema introspection responses or `schema` prop values with malicious GraphQL type names, exposing a dynamic XSS attack surface that can allow code injection on operation autocomplete. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | In order for the attack to take place, the user must load a vulnerable schema in `graphiql`. There are a number of ways that can occur. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | By default, the schema URL is \_not\_ attacker-controllable in `graphiql` or in its suggested implementations or examples, leaving only very complex attack vectors. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If a custom implementation of `graphiql`'s `fetcher` allows the schema URL to be set dynamically, such as a URL query parameter like `?endpoint=` in `graphql-playground`, or a database provided value, then this custom `graphiql` implementation is \_vulnerable to phishing attacks\_, and thus much more readily available, low or no privelege level xss attacks. The URLs could look like any generic looking graphql schema URL. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Because this exposes an XSS attack surface, it would be possible for a threat actor to exfiltrate user credentials, data, etc. using arbitrary malicious scripts, without it being known to the user. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### 1.2. Scope |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This advisory describes the impact on the `graphiql` package. The vulnerability also affects other projects forked from `graphiql` such as [`graphql-playground`](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7) and the `graphql-playground` fork distributed by Apollo Server. The impact is more severe in the `graphql-playground` implementations; see the [`graphql-playground` advisory](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-playground/security/advisories/GHSA-59r9-6jp6-jcm7) and [Apollo Server advisory](https://github.com/apollographql/apollo-server/security/advisories/GHSA-qm7x-rc44-rrqw) for details. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This vulnerability does not impact `codemirror-graphql`, `monaco-graphql` or other dependents, as it exists in `onHasCompletion.ts` in `graphiql`. It does impact all forks of `graphiql`, and every released version of `graphiql`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | It should be noted that desktop clients such as Altair, Insomnia, Postwoman, do not appear to be impacted by this. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### 1.3. Patches |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | `graphiql@1.4.3` addresses this issue via defense in depth. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - \*\*HTML-escaping text\*\* that should be treated as text rather than HTML. In most of the app, this happens automatically because React escapes all interpolated text by default. However, one vulnerable component uses the unsafe `innerHTML` API and interpolated type names directly into HTML. We now properly escape that type name, which fixes the known vulnerability. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - \*\*Validates the schema\*\* upon receiving the introspection response or schema changes. Schemas with names that violate the GraphQL spec will no longer be loaded. (This includes preventing the Doc Explorer from loading.) This change is also sufficient to fix the known vulnerability. You can disable this validation by setting `dangerouslyAssumeSchemaIsValid={true}`, which means you are relying only on escaping values to protect you from this attack. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - \*\*Ensuring that user-generated HTML is safe\*\*. Schemas can contain Markdown in `description` and `deprecationReason` fields, and the web app renders them to HTML using the `markdown-it` library. As part of the development of `graphiql@1.4.3`, we verified that our use of `markdown-it` prevents the inclusion of arbitrary HTML. We use `markdown-it` without setting `html: true`, so we are comfortable relying on [`markdown-it`'s HTML escaping](https://github.com/markdown-it/markdown-it/blob/master/docs/security.md) here. We considered running a second level of sanitization over all rendered Markdown using a library such as `dompurify` but believe that is unnecessary as `markdown-it`'s sanitization appears to be adequate. `graphiql@1.4.3` does update to the latest version of `markdown-it` (v12, from v10) so that any security fixes in v11 and v12 will take effect. |

|  |  | ### 1.3.1 CDN bundle implementations may be automatically patched |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Note that if your implementation is depending on a CDN version of `graphiql`, and is pointed to the `latest` tag (usually the default for most cdns if no version is specified) then this issue is already mitigated, in case you were vulnerable to it before. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### 1.4. Workarounds for Older Versions |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If you cannot use `graphiql@1.4.3` or later |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Always use a static URL to a trusted server that is serving a trusted GraphQL schema. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - If you have a custom implementation that allows using user-provided schema URLs via a query parameter, database value, etc, you must either disable this customization, or only allow trusted URLs. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ### 1.5. How to Re-create the Exploit |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | You can see an example on [codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/graphiql-xss-exploit-gr22f?file=/src/App.js). These are both fixed to the last `graphiql` release `1.4.2` which is the last vulnerable release; however it would work with any previous release of `graphiql`. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Both of these examples are meant to demonstrate the phishing attack surface, so they are customized to accept a `url` parameter. To demonstrate the phishing attack, add `?url=https://graphql-xss-schema.netlify.app/graphql` to the in-codesandbox browser. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Erase the contents of the given query and type `{u`. You will see an alert window open, showing that attacker-controlled code was executed. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Note that when React is in development mode, a validation exception is thrown visibly; however that exception is usually buried in the browser console in a production build of `graphiql`. This validation exception comes from `getDiagnostics`, which invokes `graphql` `validate()` which in turn will `assertValidSchema()`, as `apollo-server-core` does on executing each operation. This validation does not prevent the exploit from being successful. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | Note that something like the `url` parameter is not required for the attack to happen if `graphiql`'s `fetcher` is configured in a different way to communicate with a compromised GraphQL server. |

|  |  | ### 1.8. For more information |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | If you have any questions or comments about this advisory: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - Open an issue in [graphiql repo](https://github.com/graphql/graphiql/new/issues) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## 2. More Details on the Vulnerability |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | This section provides more details in addition to the advisory. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | An installation of the GraphiQL web app is vulnerable if two conditions are met: |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | - The web app trusts information from its corresponding GraphQL server by interpolating information such as GraphQL type names directly into HTML instead of appropriately escaping or sanitizing the information. |
|  |  | - The victim can load the web app in a way where it speaks to a GraphQL server controlled by the attacker. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | All versions of `graphiql` prior to 1.4.3 inappropriately trust type names provided by the GraphQL server. They additionally rely on XSS filtering in the `markdown-it` package to try to protect themselves from XSS attacks in GraphQL descriptions and deprecation reasons. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | By default, `graphiql` does \_not\_ allow the attacker to control what GraphQL server it speaks to. Therefore, many installations of `graphiql` are not affected by this advisory. Installations are only affected if the `fetcher` argument provided to GraphiQL allows arbitrary customization of the GraphQL endpoint (eg, reading a GraphQL URL from an URL parameter), or if the attacker has another way of affecting the introspection schema returned by the GraphQL server. (Note that `graphql-playground`, a project which started as a fork of `graphiql`, does this sort of URL parsing by default, so `graphql-playground` installations \_are\_ affected by a corresponding vulnerability in their default configuration.) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | One example of "another way of affecting the introspection schema" would be if you served `graphiql` as part of a PAAS platform that allows users to define their own GraphQL schemas. In this case, even though the `graphiql` installation might be hard-wired to a single GraphQL endpoint, the attacker has control over that GraphQL endpoint and could use it to inject scripts into `graphiql`. In this case, your `graphiql` installation could be vulnerable if it responds to introspection requests without first validating its schema. GraphQL servers can prevent this by refusing to execute operations (including introspection operations) on invalid schemas; any server built with `graphql-js` properly validates its schema prior to execution. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ## 3. Compromised introspection Schema Example |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | You can view the code for the exploited schema [on codesandbox](https://codesandbox.io/s/graphql-xss-compromised-schema-3wdq7?file=/src/bad-schema.js) or [in the repository](../../packages/graphiql/test/bad-schema.js) |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | As you can see, the introspection schema must contain items with a compromised `name` value. this could be fields, input object names, enum names, variable names, etc any graphql [NamedType](https://github.com/graphql/graphql-spec/blob/main/spec/Section%202%20--%20Language.md#type-references) in the schema with it's name rendered in the autocomplete list. |
|  |  |  |
|  |  | ```json |
|  |  | { |
|  |  | "kind": "OBJECT", |
|  |  | "name": "<img src=x onerror=alert(document.domain)>", |
|  |  | "description": null, |
|  |  | "fields": [ |
|  |  | { |
|  |  | "name": "name", |
|  |  | "description": null, |
|  |  | "args": [], |
|  |  | "type": { |
|  |  | "kind": "NON\_NULL", |
|  |  | "name": null, |
|  |  | "ofType": { |
|  |  | "kind": "SCALAR", |
|  |  | "name": "String", |
|  |  | "ofType": null |
|  |  | } |
|  |  | }, |
|  |  | "isDeprecated": false, |
|  |  | "deprecationReason": null |
|  |  | } |
|  |  | ], |
|  |  | "inputFields": null, |
|  |  | "interfaces": [], |
|  |  | "enumValues": null, |
|  |  | "possibleTypes": null |
|  |  | } |
|  |  | ``` |
