Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-41113

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a new feature in TYPO3 v11 that allows users to create and share deep links in the backend user interface. This feature is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to the improper handling of backend URIs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The core vulnerability is that an attacker can trick a logged-in backend user into performing actions they did not intend. This is facilitated by the new deep linking feature, which lacks proper protection against forged requests. The vulnerability is also described as not being limited to the same site context and does not require attacker authentication as described in CVE-2020-11069.
*   **Improper URI Handling:** The system does not sufficiently validate or sanitize the URIs used for deep linking, allowing attackers to craft malicious links that can execute actions within the backend.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Compromise:** A successful attack can lead to the creation of new admin user accounts, allowing the attacker to fully compromise the system.
*   **Unauthorized Actions:** Attackers can potentially execute any action in the backend that the victim user has permission to perform.
*   **Data Manipulation:** By gaining backend access the attacker could potentially manipulate data stored in the CMS.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Links:** An attacker crafts a malicious link containing forged parameters that, when clicked by a logged-in backend user, triggers the vulnerability.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must trick the victim into accessing the malicious link (e.g., via email, chat, or a compromised website).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to have an account on the target TYPO3 instance.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in TYPO3 backend user to click a malicious link.
*   **Network Access:** The attack can be performed remotely over a network.
*   **Specific Cookie Settings:**  The attack is successful under certain `SameSite` cookie settings:
    *   `SameSite=strict`: When a malicious site is on the same top-level domain (e.g., `evil.example.org` to `good.example.org`).
    *   `SameSite=lax` or `none`: When a malicious site is on a different domain (e.g., `evil.com` to `example.org`).

**Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade TYPO3:** Updating to version 11.5.0 addresses the vulnerability.
*   **Referer Header Check:** The fix enforces the HTTP Referer header to ensure requests originate from the TYPO3 backend, but does not prevent XSS and requires manual activation.
*   **Additional Mitigations (Recommended):**
    *   **Sudo Mode Extension:** Using the `sudo_mode` extension can provide a second confirmation step for critical actions.
    *   **Content Security Policy (CSP):** Implementing a strict CSP can limit script execution, especially in areas like `/fileadmin/` and `/uploads/`.

**Additional Notes:**
*   This vulnerability is a reintroduction of the issue described in `TYPO3-CORE-SA-2020-006 (CVE-2020-11069)` which was thought to have been fixed.
*   The provided commit `fa51999` introduces a "redirect" section in the backend routing configuration, which disables deeplinking for non-module routes by default, only allowing specific parameters.
