### @galpeter **[galpeter](/galpeter)** commented [Oct 18, 2021](#issue-1029173914)

In the Array.slice method when the engine uses fast arrays the "end" value

was not updated if the input array's length changed. This can occur when the start/end

index normalization executes a method and the length is changed forcefully.

This leads to a buffer-overflow as the element copy reads too much data from the input

array.

Fixes: [#4777](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/issues/4777)

Sorry, something went wrong.
