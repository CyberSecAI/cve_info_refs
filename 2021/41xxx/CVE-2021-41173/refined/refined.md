Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-41173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two issues within the `go-ethereum` implementation, specifically related to the `snap/1` protocol and the handling of Trie nodes:

1.  **Nil Pointer Dereference in `trie.TryGetNode`:** The `trie.TryGetNode` function did not check if the `origNode` was nil before calling the `cache()` method on it, leading to a nil pointer dereference and a crash. This could be triggered when a malicious peer requests a non-existent path, leading to a `nil` origNode in the `trie.tryGetNode` function.
2.  **Incorrect Handling of `snap.Account` Return Value:** The code assumed that `snap.Account` would always return either a valid (non-nil) account or an error. However, `snap.Account` could return `nil, nil`, which resulted in a nil pointer dereference when trying to access the `Root` field of the `nil` account. This specifically occurs when a storage trie is requested.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Nil pointer dereference:** The code did not properly handle nil values in two different scenarios when processing p2p messages.
*   **Improper error handling:** The code made incorrect assumptions about the return values of the `snap.Account` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A malicious peer could send crafted `snap/1` messages (specifically `GetTrieNodes` packages) to crash a vulnerable node, disrupting its ability to participate in the network. The node would panic and terminate.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network (P2P):** Attackers would need to connect to a vulnerable node as a peer through the `snap/1` protocol.
*   **Malicious P2P Messages:** The attack involves crafting specific `snap/1` `GetTrieNodes` messages to trigger the vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to connect to the target node.
*   **Ethereum P2P Protocol Knowledge:** An attacker needs to be able to craft messages according to the `snap/1` protocol.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was found by Gary Rong (@rjl493456442), with additional analysis by @holiman.
* The fix was included in version v1.10.9.
* The vulnerability is considered moderate severity.
