# DoS via malicious snap/1 request

Moderate

[holiman](/holiman)
published
GHSA-59hh-656j-3p7v
Oct 25, 2021

## Package

gomod

go-ethereum
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<1.10.9

## Patched versions

1.10.9

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerable node is susceptible to crash when processing a maliciously crafted message from a peer, via the `snap/1` protocol. The crash can be triggered by sending a malicious `snap/1` `GetTrieNodes` package.

### Details

On September 21, 2021, geth-team member Gary Rong ([@rjl493456442](https://github.com/rjl493456442)) found a way to crash the snap request handler .

By using this vulnerability, a peer connected on the `snap/1` protocol could cause a vulnerable node to crash with a `panic`.

In the `trie.TryGetNode` implementation, if the requested path is reached, the associated node will be returned. However the nilness is

not checked there.

```
func (t *Trie) tryGetNode(origNode node, path []byte, pos int) (item []byte, newnode node, resolved int, err error) {
	// If we reached the requested path, return the current node
	if pos >= len(path) {
		// Although we most probably have the original node expanded, encoding
		// that into consensus form can be nasty (needs to cascade down) and
		// time consuming. Instead, just pull the hash up from disk directly.
		var hash hashNode
		if node, ok := origNode.(hashNode); ok {
			hash = node
		} else {
			hash, _ = origNode.cache()
		}
```

More specifically the `origNode` can be nil(e.g. the child of fullnode) and system can panic at line `hash, _ = origNode.cache()`.

When investigating this, [@holiman](https://github.com/holiman) tried to find it via fuzzing, which uncovered a second crasher, also related to the snap `GetTrieNodes` package. If the caller requests a storage trie:

```
				// Storage slots requested, open the storage trie and retrieve from there
				account, err := snap.Account(common.BytesToHash(pathset[0]))
				loads++ // always account database reads, even for failures
				if account == nil {
					break
				}
				stTrie, err := trie.NewSecure(common.BytesToHash(account.Root), triedb)
```

The code assumes that `snap.Account` returns *either* a non-nil response unless `error` is also provided. This is however not the case, since `snap.Account` can return `nil, nil`.

[v1.10.9](/ethereum/go-ethereum/tree/v1.10.9)

[`eae3b19`](/ethereum/go-ethereum/commit/eae3b1946a276ac099e0018fc792d9e8c3bfda6d)

Geth v1.10.9 is a maintenance release containing mostly bug fixes.

Chain tracing has received quite a bit of attention during this release cycle. JS-based tracing now supports additional callbacks for entry and exit of contract calls, improving performance if processing individual opcodes is not needed.

#### Geth command changes

* The 'evm' command has a new subcommand for testing tx decoding. ([#23494](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23494))
* 'evm t8n' now calculates and returns block difficulty. ([#23353](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23353), [#23507](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23507))
* Legacy flags `--rpc`, `--rpcaddr`, `--rpcport`, etc. are no longer supported. ([#23358](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23358))
* Legacy debugging flags `--pprofport`, `--pprofaddr`, etc. are also no longer supported. ([#23368](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23368))
* When initializing Clique-based private networks, zero-length extradata in genesis.json now prints an error message instead of crashing. ([#23538](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23538))

#### Go library changes

* Contract bindings created by accounts/abi/bind now validate log event signatures. This prevents accidentally decoding events with the wrong signature. ([#23230](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23230))
* A crash in accounts/abi when decoding struct-typed Solidity return values is resolved. ([#23573](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23573))
* Writes to the ancient database are now batched internally for improved performance. ([#23462](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23462))
* Multiple data races in transaction pool code are fixed. ([#23474](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23474))
* Comprehensive benchmarks for RLP encoding/decoding of consensus types have been added. ([#23190](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23190))
* RLP encoding of slices and arrays is slightly faster. ([#23467](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23467))
* `rpc.BlockNumber` now implements encoding.TextMarshaler. ([#23324](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23324))
* The `Account` type has been moved from package core/state to core/types. ([#23567](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23567))
* For crypto/cloudflare/bn256 EC curve, in-place addition and unmarshalling now works correctly. ([#23419](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23419))
* A very rare crash in the background 'bloombits' indexer is resolved. ([#23437](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23437))

#### RPC/GraphQL changes

* JS tracing of EVM execution now provides additional callbacks for call entry/exit. Using these callbacks instead of 'step' can yield a 10-100x tracing speedup if you don't need to process every VM opcode. ([#23087](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23087))
* The '4byte' built-in tracer now uses enter/exit. ([#23622](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23622))
* A state database corruption bug caused by tracer re-execution of old blocks is resolved. ([#23632](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23632))
* The new `debug_intermediateRoots` method computes per-transaction state roots of a block. ([#23594](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23594))
* EVM memory and return data are no longer captured by default when tracing. ([#23558](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23558))
* EVM execution is now aborted on the server side when tracing is interrupted. ([#23580](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23580))
* Broken WebSocket connections are now detected better and their subscriptions report an error instead of hanging indefinitely. ([#23556](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23556))
* `personal_sendTransaction` now supports both "input" and "data" arguments, just like `eth_sendTransaction`. ([#23476](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23476))
* Log filtering performance is improved. ([#23147](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23147))
* Transaction access lists returned by GraphQL are now correct. ([#23650](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23650))
* The `debug_stacks` method now supports an optional filter expression. ([#23605](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23605))
* For clique blocks returned by RPC, the "miner" field once again contains the actual block coinbase field instead of the derived block signer. This fixes a regression where clients would no longer be able to verify the block seal signature. ([#23466](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23466))

#### Networking

* The eth/65 peer-to-peer protocol is no longer supported. Geth only supports eth/66 as of this release. ([#23456](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23456))
* The cross-client eth protocol tests suite better distinguishes eth/65 and eth/66. ([#23568](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23568))
* ENR sequence numbers are now initialized as a timestamp. This prevents issues when the p2p nodes database is dropped/re-created while keeping the nodekey the same. ([#19903](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/19903))
* Several data races are resolved in packages p2p and p2p/enode. ([#23434](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23434))
* Note: to simplify the ongoing rewrite of eth/downloader, the package has been duplicated temporarily. The additional copy will be removed later. ([#23561](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23561))

#### Build

* This release is built with Go 1.17. ([#23464](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23464), [#23465](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23465), [#23468](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23468))
* 32 bit builds of Geth should be fully functional again. ([#23543](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23543), [#23542](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23542))
* We no longer publish .deb packages for Ubuntu 20.10 Gorilla because this version is not supported by Launchpad anymore. ([#23470](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23470))
* The 'node' package no longer depends on wallet backends. Specifically, this removes the dependencies on libusb for contract bindings and other uses of the go-ethereum library. If you are using package node, you must now register required account manager backends individually. ([#23019](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23019))
* The 'metrics' package, and many packages that depend on it can now be compiled for WebAssembly. ([#23449](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23449))
* EVM performance tests no longer run on CI. ([#23304](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23304))

For a full rundown of the changes please consult the Geth 1.10.9 [release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/121?closed=1).
