Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41836:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content directly mentions "CVE-2021-41836" and describes it as a security issue fixed in version 3.0.5 of the Fathom Analytics WordPress plugin.
   - The content from plugins.trac.wordpress.org details a commit message for version 3.0.5 that states "Fixed security issue where admins could hijack super administrators in multi-site install". This aligns with the vulnerability description from Wordfence, indicating a stored XSS issue.

**2. Extracted Information:**

   - **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
     - The vulnerability arises from insufficient input validation and escaping of the `fathom_site_id` parameter within the Fathom Analytics plugin's settings page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the plugin's settings.
     -  The vulnerability occurs specifically within the `~/fathom-analytics.php` file.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
     - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw, where malicious JavaScript can be persistently stored in the plugin's settings and then executed in the browsers of users accessing those settings pages, this affects users with administrative capabilities.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - **Account Hijacking:** An attacker could leverage the XSS vulnerability to inject malicious code that could hijack super administrator accounts in multi-site installations.
        - This is confirmed by the commit message "Fixed security issue where admins could hijack super administrators in multi-site install." and the changelog entry "Fixed security issue where an administrator could inject XSS code into the Analytics tab and gain access to super administrator accounts on a multi-site installation."
   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - The primary attack vector is through the plugin's settings page. An attacker with administrative privileges can insert the malicious JavaScript code through the `fathom_site_id` field.
     - Once the malicious JavaScript is stored, it is executed when an administrator accesses the settings page for the Fathom Analytics plugin.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - The attacker needs to have administrative privileges (or potentially manage_options capabilities), as they need access to the plugin's settings.
      - The vulnerability also affects multi-site installations where `unfiltered_html` is disabled for administrators and sites where `unfiltered_html` is disabled.

**Additional Notes:**
