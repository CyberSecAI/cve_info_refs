# Reflected XSS vulnerability in time.php

Low

[anuko](/anuko)
published
GHSA-h2v8-87c9-86cw
Oct 13, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.19.30.5600

## Patched versions

1.19.30.5600

## Description

### Impact

When a logged on user selects a date in Time Tracker, it is being passed on via the date parameter in URI. Because of not checking this parameter for sanity in versions prior to 1.19.30.5600, it was possible to craft the URI with malicious JavaScript, use social engineering to convince logged on user to click on such link, and have the attacker-supplied JavaScript to be executed in user's browser.

### Patches

Patched in version 1.19.30.5600.

### Workarounds

Upgrade is recommended. If it is not practical, introduce `ttValidDbDateFormatDate` function as in the latest version and add a call to it within the access checks block in time.php.
