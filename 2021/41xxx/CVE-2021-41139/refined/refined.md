Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41139:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper sanitization of the 'date' parameter in the `time.php` file. User-supplied input through the date parameter in the URI is not validated or sanitized before being used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Lack of input validation on the 'date' parameter

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could craft a malicious URI containing JavaScript code within the 'date' parameter. If a logged-in user is tricked into clicking on such a link, the attacker-supplied JavaScript will execute in the user's browser. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as stealing session cookies or performing administrative actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a crafted URL.
- Attackers would use social engineering to trick a logged-in user into clicking the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a logged-in user to click the malicious link (social engineering).

**Additional Information**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 1.19.30.5600 of Time Tracker.
- The fix involves adding the `ttValidDbDateFormatDate` function and calling it to validate the 'date' parameter in `time.php`.
- The vulnerability was identified by @indevi0us
- The vulnerability has a low severity rating.
