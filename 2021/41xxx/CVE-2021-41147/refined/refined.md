Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-41147

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of user inputs when constructing SQL queries for editing agile dashboard planning in Tuleap. Specifically, the `mapping_field` form parameter was vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89) vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper input sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker with admin rights in an agile dashboard service can execute arbitrary SQL queries. This could lead to:
  - Unauthorized access to sensitive data (Confidentiality: High)
  - Modification of data (Integrity: High)
  - Denial of service due to database manipulation (Availability: High)

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack (CVSS Attack Vector: Network)
- The attacker modifies the `mapping_field` form parameter. For example, `mapping_field[56][values][45][]` could be changed to `mapping_field[56][values][45)][]` to trigger an SQL error.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrator privileges within an agile dashboard service. (CVSS Privileges Required: High)
- No user interaction is required for the exploit (CVSS User Interaction: None)
- The attack complexity is low (CVSS Attack Complexity: Low).

**Affected Versions:**
- Tuleap versions before 11.16.99.173, versions 11.16-1 to 11.16-5, and versions 11.15-1 to 11.15-7

**Patched Versions:**
- Tuleap Community Edition 11.16.99.173
- Tuleap Enterprise Edition 11.16-6
- Tuleap Enterprise Edition 11.15-8

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in commit `d6b2f8b8c5098938bc094726a4826479ddbee941`.
- The affected code was located in `plugins/cardwall/include/OnTop/ColumnMappingFieldValueDao.class.php`, where input values were not escaped correctly before being used in SQL queries. The fix includes escaping integer values using the `$this->da->escapeInt()` method.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 7.2 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
