  "CVE_data": {
    "related_to_CVE": true,
    "description": "The vulnerability lies in how sshd initializes supplemental groups when executing AuthorizedKeysCommand or AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand. When these commands are configured to run as a different user via AuthorizedKeysCommandUser or AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser directives, they incorrectly inherit the groups of the sshd process instead of the intended user's groups.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      {
        "weakness": "sshd fails to correctly initialize supplemental groups when executing commands using AuthorizedKeysCommand or AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand with a different user specified, inheriting sshd process groups instead.",
         "impact": "Privilege escalation: Helper programs for AuthorizedKeysCommand and AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand may run with group memberships of the sshd process, potentially leading to unintended access.",
        "attack_vectors": [
           "By exploiting this issue, an unprivileged malicious user with local system access could potentially gain additional privileges on the system. This could happen if they are able to tamper with the process being run by taking advantage of the incorrectly inherited groups.",
           "An attacker who can control or influence the configured commands (AuthorizedKeysCommand, AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand) could use this vulnerability to escalate privileges."
         ],
        "required_capabilities": [
          "Local system access as an unprivileged user who can tamper with the process.",
          "Ability to supply arbitrary user/hostnames to ssh.",
          "sshd configuration must specify to run the command as a different user using AuthorizedKeysCommandUser or AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser directives."
        ],
        "additional_information": "The issue is present in OpenSSH 6.2 through 8.7. The vulnerability is not exploitable if AuthorizedKeysCommand or AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand are not enabled, or if commands are not run as a different user."
