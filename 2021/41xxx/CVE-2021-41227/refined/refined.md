Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The `ImmutableConst` operation in TensorFlow has a vulnerability related to how it handles memory-mapped strings, specifically the `tstring` TensorFlow string class. The `tstring` class has special handling for memory-mapped strings, but the `ImmutableConst` operation does not have proper support for this data type. This allows for the reading of arbitrary memory contents.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Arbitrary Memory Read:** The primary vulnerability is that the `ImmutableConst` operation can be manipulated to read data from arbitrary memory locations.
- **Lack of Type Support:** The `ImmutableConst` operation doesn't properly handle the `DT_STRING` data type when used with memory-mapped strings, which is exploited by the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use this vulnerability to potentially read sensitive information from the memory space of the TensorFlow process. This could include model data, configuration details, or other sensitive information residing in memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Input:** By providing a crafted `memory_region_name` to the `ImmutableConst` operation an attacker could potentially specify a memory region that is not intended to be accessed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- An attacker would need the ability to provide input to a TensorFlow model that uses the vulnerable `ImmutableConst` operation.
- The attacker would need to be able to specify the `memory_region_name` to control the memory location being read.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in commits `3712a2d3455e6ccb924daa5724a3652a86f6b585` and `1cb6bb6c2a6019417c9adaf9e6843ba75ee2580b`.
- The fixes include adding error checking to prevent the use of `DT_STRING` with `ImmutableConst`, and also fixing some byte-swapping logic related to "Offset" type strings.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.7.0.
- Patched versions include 2.4.4, 2.5.2 and 2.6.1.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
