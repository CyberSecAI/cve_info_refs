Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41126:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authentication logic of October CMS where deleted administrator accounts could still sign in to the admin interface, provided they had prior access.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Insufficient Session Management:** The system failed to properly invalidate or revoke authentication tokens/sessions associated with deleted administrator accounts.
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The application did not enforce proper access control checks to prevent deleted users from accessing the admin interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Access:** A deleted administrator could regain access to the administrative backend.
- **Privilege Escalation:** While not strictly privilege *escalation* since the user had admin access before, it results in the *reinstatement* of admin privileges for an entity that was intended to be removed, and could lead to unauthorized data modification, system configuration changes, or denial of service.
- **Data Breach potential:** Depending on the level of access of the deleted admin, there is a possibility of unauthorized access of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Direct Authentication:** An attacker who is a deleted admin can try to log in with their old credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Previous Admin Access:** The attacker needs to have previously held administrative privileges in the October CMS system.
- **Knowledge of Old Credentials:** The attacker needs to know the credentials associated with the deleted admin account.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was addressed in version 2.1.12 of October CMS.
- Workarounds included resetting the passwords of deleted accounts or contacting the developers for code change instructions.
- This vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
