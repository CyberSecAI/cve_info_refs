Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41614:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect implementation of read/write access control for the Exception Program Counter Register (EPCR) in the mor1kx processor. This register is intended to be accessible only from supervisor mode, but the implementation allows access from user mode.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **CWE-1198:** Privilege Separation and Access Control Issues. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control for a privileged register (EPCR), which can be accessed from a lower privilege level.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Escalation of Privileges:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the EPCR register, which stores the program counter for exception handling. By modifying this register and manipulating the Exception Status Register (ESR), an attacker can cause the processor to jump to attacker controlled code with machine mode privileges when an exception return (rfe) is executed. This effectively allows the execution of arbitrary code with the highest privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Local:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a user-mode program running on the affected processor.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Local User Mode Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code in user mode on the target system. The ability to write to memory is also required to place the attacker's exploit code.
- **Knowledge of the EPCR and ESR registers** The attacker needs to understand the role of the EPCR and ESR registers to manipulate them and control the execution flow.

**More Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in the `mor1kx_ctrl_cappuccino.v` file of the mor1kx processor design.
- The OpenRISC specification mandates that the EPCR register should only be accessible from supervisor mode.
- The provided exploit code demonstrates how to switch to user mode and then write to the EPCR register.
- The or1ksim emulator correctly denies access to the EPCR register from user mode while the mor1kx hardware implementation does not.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the hardware fuzzer, TheHuzz.
- The affected code base is located in the openrisc/mor1kx repository between commit ID `95eee0596a160ffdfd8ee6bc8b88268b2e49ec5e` and `e51654a40c49d0bc0ff30f1a8d8586c7dd443a08` on the master branch.
