**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection mechanisms in Galette versions prior to 0.9.6.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

    *   **CWE-352:** This vulnerability is classified under CWE-352, which refers to Cross-Site Request Forgery.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can trick an authenticated user into performing unwanted actions within the Galette web application.
    *   This can lead to data manipulation, unauthorized changes to user settings, or other malicious activities, depending on the actions available in the application.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
   *  **Social Engineering:** Attackers can use techniques like sending malicious links via email or chat.
   *  **Malicious Websites:** An attacker could host a malicious website that crafts forged requests targeting the Galette application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trick an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link or visiting a crafted web page.
    *   The attacker does not need to have prior access to the Galette application itself. They exploit the trust between the user's browser and the application.
