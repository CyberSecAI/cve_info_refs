Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `sor_cible`, `sor_champs`, and `sor_ordre` parameters within the `/includes/library.php` file. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to Time-based Boolean Blind SQL Injection. The vulnerable parameters are not sanitized before being used in SQL queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can extract all data from the database, including user credentials and administrative details, leading to full application compromise.
*   If the database has misconfigurations, the attacker could potentially compromise the underlying operating system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack is carried out by sending crafted POST requests to the `/includes/library.php` endpoint.
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The `sor_cible`, `sor_champs`, and `sor_ordre` POST parameters are the injection points.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated user, meaning no login is required.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Technical Details:**

*   The `/includes/library.php` file does not require user authentication.
*   The vulnerable code uses user-supplied parameters directly in SQL queries without sanitization.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited through time-based SQL injection, where the attacker can determine the truth of a condition based on the response time of the server.
*   The attacker can inject malicious SQL code in the `sor_cible`, `sor_champs`, or `sor_ordre` parameters.
*   The blog post provides examples of exploitation techniques showing how to induce a sleep statement based on the truth of an injected condition using different parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than the typical CVE description, including example HTTP requests and SQL queries.
*   The blog post also provides evidence of successful exploitation, such as dumping the database banner and administrative credentials.

The information provided in the blog post confirms the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability as described in CVE-2021-41920.
