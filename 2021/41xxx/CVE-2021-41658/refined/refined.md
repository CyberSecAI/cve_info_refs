{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Student Quarterly Grading System application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the 'users' section, specifically the 'fullname' and 'username' parameters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
       "Stored XSS"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the 'fullname' or 'username' fields, which will be stored in the application's database. When an administrator views the affected data, the malicious script is executed in their browser, allowing the attacker to potentially steal the administrator's session ID (PHPSESSID). This enables the attacker to hijack the administrator's session and gain unauthorized access to the application.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious XSS payload and injects it into the 'fullname' or 'username' fields via the user registration or update function of the application.",
       "The attacker leverages the stored XSS payload by having an administrator view the affected data"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have an account with the ability to modify the 'fullname' or 'username' fields, potentially requiring some level of access to the application. After injecting the malicious payload, the attacker does not need any further interaction with the application until they want to steal the admin session.",
      "additional_information": "The provided content contains a link to a video demonstration of the exploit (streamable.com/kk96j4). It also includes a proof-of-concept exploit script named PWNPHPSESSID.py which is intended for the PHPSESSID hijacking aspect of the vulnerability."
