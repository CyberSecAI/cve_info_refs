Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerabilities in Wuzhicms v4.1.0:

**Root Cause:** The primary cause of these vulnerabilities is the insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input (`$keyValue` parameter) before its use in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in SQL queries, allowing attackers to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary SQL Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands, potentially leading to:
    * **Data Breach:** Accessing sensitive information stored in the database.
    * **Data Manipulation:** Modifying or deleting data.
    * **Privilege Escalation:** Potentially gaining administrative privileges.
    * **Webshell Upload:** Writing a webshell and taking complete control of the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP GET parameters:** The vulnerabilities are triggered by manipulating the `$keyValue` parameter via HTTP GET requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
* **Knowledge of vulnerable parameters:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable parameters (`keyValue`, `keyType`, `fieldtype`) to exploit the injection points.

**Specific Vulnerable Locations & Details:**
1.  **/coreframe/app/pay/admin/index.php (listing function):**
    *   Vulnerable parameter: `$keyValue`
    *   SQL injection occurs in the `WHERE` clause when filtering by order number, phone number, customer service username, or dealer username.
    *   POC: `/index.php?m=pay&f=index&v=listing&_su=wuzhicms&keyValue=1111'/**/union/**/select/**/updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select DATABASE()),0x7e),1);-- -`
2.  **/coreframe/app/pay/admin/index.php (relay function):**
    *   Vulnerable parameters: `$keyType`, `$keyValue`
    *   SQL injection occurs when searching for members based on `$keyType` (e.g., `uid`) and `$keyValue`.
     * POC: `/index.php?m=pay&f=index&v=relay&_su=wuzhicms&keyType=uid&keyValue=111'/**/union/**/select/**/updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select DATABASE()),0x7e),1);-- -`
3.  **/coreframe/app/order/admin/index.php (listing function):**
    *   Vulnerable parameters: `$fieldtype` and `$keyValue`
    *   SQL injection occurs when filtering orders based on order ID, remark, member username, or tracking number.
    *   POC: `/index.php?m=order&f=index&v=listing&_su=wuzhicms&keyValue=111'/**/union/**/select/**/updatexml(1,concat(0x7e,(select DATABASE()),0x7e),1);-- -&fieldtype=1`

**Additional Notes:**
*   The identified vulnerabilities allow for `UNION`-based SQL injection, which can be used to extract data and potentially perform other malicious actions.
*   The attacker can potentially leverage SQL injection to elevate privileges, and write webshell.
