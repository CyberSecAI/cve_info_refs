# CWL Viewer: deserialization of untrusted data can lead to complete takeover by an attacker

Critical

[mr-c](/mr-c)
published
GHSA-7g7j-f5g3-fqp7
Sep 30, 2021

## Package

cwlviewer
(GitHub)

## Affected versions

=< 1.3.0

## Patched versions

1.4.0

## Description

### Impact

What kind of vulnerability is it? [Deserialization of Untrusted Data](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/502.html)

Who is impacted? Anyone running cwlviewer older than [f6066f0](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/commit/f6066f09edb70033a2ce80200e9fa9e70a5c29de) (dated 2021-09-30)

### Patches

Patched in [f6066f0](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/commit/f6066f09edb70033a2ce80200e9fa9e70a5c29de) , released as part of [cwlviewer v1.4](https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/releases/tag/v1.4)

The instance at <https://view.commonwl.org> has been updated as well

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?* No. The SnakeYaml constructor, by default, allows any data to be parsed. To fix the issue the object needs to be created with a `SafeConstructor` object, as seen in the patch.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?* [Analysis of the SnakeYaml deserialization in Java Security](https://www.fatalerrors.org/a/analysis-of-the-snakeyaml-deserialization-in-java-security.html)

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/common-workflow-language/cwlviewer/issues>
* Email us at security@commonwl.org

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41110

### Weaknesses
