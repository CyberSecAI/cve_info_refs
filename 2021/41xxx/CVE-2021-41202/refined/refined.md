{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an implicit conversion between int64 and double types within the `tf.range` kernel during the calculation of output size. The conditional statement `int64 = condition ? int64 : double` leads to both branches being cast to `double`, and the result is then truncated before assignment. This can lead to overflows when start or end values are large.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type conversion issues",
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can cause crashes due to overflows when calculating the size of the output in `tf.range` or `tf.sparse.eye` if the start/end values or `num_rows` is too large. This can lead to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing large values for start, limit or num_rows in `tf.range` and `tf.sparse.eye` function calls",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to control the inputs to `tf.range` and `tf.sparse.eye`."
