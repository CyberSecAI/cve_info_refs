# Overflow/crash in `tf.range`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-xrqm-fpgr-6hhx
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

While calculating the size of the output within the `tf.range` kernel, there is a conditional statement of type `int64 = condition ? int64 : double`. Due to C++ implicit conversion rules, both branches of the condition will be cast to `double` and the result would be truncated before the assignment. This result in overflows:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.sparse.eye(num_rows=9223372036854775807, num_columns=None)
```

Similarly, `tf.range` would result in crashes due to overflows if the start or end point are too large.

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.range(start=-1e+38, limit=1)
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commits [6d94002a09711d297dbba90390d5482b76113899](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/6d94002a09711d297dbba90390d5482b76113899) (merging [#51359](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51359)) and [1b0e0ec27e7895b9985076eab32445026ae5ca94](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/1b0e0ec27e7895b9985076eab32445026ae5ca94) (merging [#51711](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51711)).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

![@DNXie](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24580222?u=1099f14e707eff0398b4878b0fe5def0af59d337&v=4&size=48)[DNXie](https://github.com/DNXie)opened [on Feb 4, 2021](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46912#issue-800924135)

**System information**

* Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
* OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04
* Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
* TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
* TensorFlow version (use command below):2.1.0
* Python version:3.7.6
* Bazel version (if compiling from source):N/A
* GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):N/A
* CUDA/cuDNN version:N/A
* GPU model and memory:N/A

**Describe the current behavior**

`tf.sparse.eye` crashes(aborts) when `num_rows` contains large number

**Describe the expected behavior**

expect an exception message if the input unexpected instead of crash.

**Standalone code to reproduce the issue**

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
tf.sparse.eye(num_rows=9223372036854775807, num_columns=None)
```

Output

```
2021-02-04 04:36:57.184236: F tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc:345] Check failed: size >= 0 (-9223372036854775808 vs. 0)
