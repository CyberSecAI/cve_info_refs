Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is that the user refresh mechanism in Pomerium was not being called. This resulted in user records containing stale Identity Provider (IDP) claims. While sessions were being refreshed, the user records were not updated with the latest claims from the IDP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Stale IDP Claims:** User records did not reflect changes in user OIDC claims after the initial login.
- **Incorrect Authorization Decisions:** The use of `allowed_idp_claims` in policies resulted in authorization decisions based on outdated information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Incorrect Authorization:**  Pomerium could grant access to resources to users who should no longer have access based on their current claims, or deny access to users who now have the required claims.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the claims used for authorization, an attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access or perform actions they shouldn't be able to.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Change of User Claims:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by having their user claims changed in the Identity Provider after their initial login to Pomerium.
- **Policy Bypass:** By manipulating claims outside of Pomerium, the attacker could potentially bypass policy checks based on `allowed_idp_claims`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid User Account:** The attacker must have a valid user account within the Identity Provider used by Pomerium.
- **Ability to Change Claims:** The attacker needs a scenario where their user claims are modified in the Identity Provider after initially logging into Pomerium.
- **Awareness of `allowed_idp_claims`:** The attacker must be aware that `allowed_idp_claims` are being used in Pomerium policies.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Pomerium versions 0.14.0 through 0.15.5 and patched in version 0.15.6.
- A workaround is to clear the data on the `databroker` service (e.g. redis or restarting in-memory databroker), which forces a refresh of user claims.
- The issue was identified in internal issue #618 and fixed by pull request #2724.
- This vulnerability is categorized under CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).
