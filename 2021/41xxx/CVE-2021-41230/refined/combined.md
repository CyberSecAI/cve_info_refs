## Summary

User refresh was never getting called. This resulted in stale IDP claims in user records (although sessions were getting refreshed, so those claims were updated).

## Related issues

Fixes <https://github.com/pomerium/internal/issues/618>

## Checklist

* reference any related issues
* updated docs
* updated unit tests
* updated UPGRADING.md
* add appropriate tag (`improvement` / `bug` / etc)
* ready for review

Sorry, something went wrong.

Moderate

GHSA-j6wp-3859-vxfg
Nov 5, 2021

## Package

gomod

pomerium
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

0.14.0-0.15.5

## Patched versions

0.15.6

## Description

### Impact

Changes to the OIDC claims of a user after initial login are not reflected in policy evaluation when using [`allowed_idp_claims`](https://www.pomerium.com/reference/#allowed-idp-claims) as part of policy. If using `allowed_idp_claims` and a user's claims are changed, Pomerium can make incorrect authorization decisions.

### Patches

v0.15.6

### Workarounds

* Clear data on `databroker` service by clearing redis or restarting the in-memory databroker to force claims to be updated
