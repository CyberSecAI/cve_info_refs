{
  "CVE-2021-41136": {
    "Description": "Puma with a proxy which forwards HTTP header values which contain the LF character could allow HTTP request smuggling. A client could smuggle a request through a proxy, causing the proxy to send a response back to another unknown client.",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from Puma's inconsistent interpretation of HTTP requests when dealing with proxies that forward LF characters as line endings. Puma incorrectly processes requests containing LF characters in headers, leading to request smuggling.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent interpretation of HTTP requests",
      "Improper handling of LF characters in HTTP headers",
      "HTTP Request Smuggling"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could smuggle a request through a proxy, leading the proxy to send a response to an unintended client. This can result in information disclosure or other unauthorized actions.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack involves sending a crafted HTTP request with LF characters in the headers through a vulnerable proxy to the Puma server.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable proxy, which then forwards those requests to a Puma server. The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the server, as the attack is network-based."
