Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41205:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the shape inference functions for the `QuantizeAndDequantizeV*` operations within TensorFlow. Specifically, when the `axis` attribute of these operations is set to a negative value other than -1 (which is used for optional/unknown dimensions), the code attempts to access a dimension using `c->Dim(input, axis)` without validating that the `axis` is within the valid range, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds read on a heap-allocated array due to the lack of proper validation of the `axis` parameter.
- **Incorrect handling of negative axis values:** The code incorrectly handles negative axis values different from -1. Instead of treating them as an error, the code uses them as an index, leading to the OOB read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap OOB read:** An attacker could trigger a read outside of the bounds of a heap-allocated array by crafting a specific input with a negative `axis` parameter. This can potentially lead to information disclosure and other undefined behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **TensorFlow API calls:** An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by calling the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV*` functions (`QuantizeAndDequantizeV2`, `QuantizeAndDequantizeV3`, `QuantizeAndDequantizeV4`, and `QuantizeAndDequantizeV4Grad`) with a crafted negative `axis` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide input to TensorFlow operations:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the parameters, particularly the `axis` parameter, of the vulnerable operations. This could be done by controlling the input to a TensorFlow model or by directly calling the raw TensorFlow operations.
- **Basic knowledge of the TensorFlow API:** The attacker needs to be familiar with how to call the `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeAndDequantizeV*` operations and how to set their attributes.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided commit `7cf73a2274732c9d82af51c2bc2cf90d13cd7e6d` addresses the vulnerability by adding a check to ensure that the axis value is valid and by adding unit tests that verify this check.
- The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1, and is also in 2.7.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
