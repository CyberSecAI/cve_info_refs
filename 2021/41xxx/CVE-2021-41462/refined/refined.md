The provided content contains information about a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in concrete5-legacy, which is relevant to CVE-2021-41462.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled parameters (`rel`, `ctID`, `mode`, and `cID`) before they are displayed in the application's web pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the HTML output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- This can lead to:
    - Unauthorized actions being performed on behalf of the victim.
    - Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    - Stealing of session information.
    - Denial of service attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL containing the XSS payload within the vulnerable parameters (e.g., `rel`, `ctID`, `mode`, `cID`).
- The attacker must then trick a victim user into clicking the malicious link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs the ability to trick a user into visiting the malicious URL.

**Vulnerable files:**
- `concrete/elements/collection_add.php` (parameters `rel`, `ctID`, and `mode`)
- `concrete/elements/collection_theme.php` (parameter `rel`)
- `concrete/tools/permissions/dialogs/access/entity/types/group_combination.php` (parameter `cID`)
