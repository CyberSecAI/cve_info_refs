|  |  | This is a bugfix release that includes a fix to a severe security vulnerability. It is recommended that all users that have Mycodo exposed to the internet and allow guest access upgrade to patch this vulnerability. Users that only run Mycodo on a local network and/or don't allow unknown user (i.e. guest) access likely won't be affected. |

## 8.12.7 (2021-10-25)

This is a bugfix release that includes a fix to a severe security vulnerability. It is recommended that all users that have Mycodo exposed to the internet and allow guest access upgrade to patch this vulnerability.

* Fix Gauge Widget dependencies ([#1100](https://github.com/kizniche/mycodo/issues/1100))
* Fix installation of pigpiod
* Fix file exploit vulnerability ([#1105](https://github.com/kizniche/mycodo/issues/1105))

### Features

* Add ability to install on most Debian-based systems
* Add ability for Actions to work on Function Controllers
* Add LCD Backlight On/Off Actions to LCD Functions ([#1089](https://github.com/kizniche/mycodo/issues/1089))
* Add Input: SHT2x (using alternate sht20 library with more accurate measurements and settable temperature resolution)
* Add Input: SHTC3

### Miscellaneous

* Update python packages

# Download file outside intended directory

High

[kizniche](/kizniche)
published
GHSA-252r-94ph-m229
Oct 26, 2021

## Package

Mycodo
(Python)

## Affected versions

<=8.12.6

## Patched versions

8.12.7

## Description

### Impact

The exploit allows anyone with access to endpoints to download files outside the intended directory. Initially discovered in [#1105](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/issues/1105)

### Patches

A patch has been applied and a release made. Users should upgrade to >= [v8.12.7](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/releases/tag/v8.12.7)

### Workarounds

If users don't with to upgrade, they can manually apply the changes from commit [23ac5dd](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/commit/23ac5dd422029c2b6ae1701a3599b6d41b66a6a9)

### References

Commit [23ac5dd](https://github.com/kizniche/Mycodo/commit/23ac5dd422029c2b6ae1701a3599b6d41b66a6a9) can be referenced to see the vulnerable code.

Essentially:

```
@blueprint.route('/note_attachment/<filename>')
def send_note_attachment(filename):
    """Return a file from the note attachment directory"""
    file_path = os.path.join(PATH_NOTE_ATTACHMENTS, filename)
    return send_file(file_path, as_attachment=True)
```

This allows someone to use relative paths in their query to obtain files outside the PATH\_NOTE\_ATTACHMENTS directory.

Fixed with:

```
@blueprint.route('/note_attachment/<filename>')
def send_note_attachment(filename):
    """Return a file from the note attachment directory"""
    file_path = os.path.join(PATH_NOTE_ATTACHMENTS, filename)
    if os.path.abspath(file_path).startswith(PATH_NOTE_ATTACHMENTS):
        return send_file(file_path, as_attachment=True)
```
