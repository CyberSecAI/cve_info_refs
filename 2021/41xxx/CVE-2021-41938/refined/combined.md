| Affects version `shopxo 2.2.0` After entering the management page as admininstrator there is an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in 3 locations , you can upload webshell into the site. The first location: `网站管理->主题管理->主题安装` the post url is `/admin.php?s=theme/upload.html` the step is:   1. download the default theme from [offical(https://shopxo.store/goods-80.html)](https://shopxo.store/goods-80.html) 2. unzip the zip 3. Only delete files with "php" suffix due to file security check, new a evil file named phpinfo.pHp or phpinfo.phtml in the "css" folder and the root folder    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41777086/135379294-44b933ac-be99-41e4-9ec4-6a7f0f8dc8e1.png)    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41777086/135379315-c0a79972-3c9f-4c71-a2a7-4b39b85ee8c5.png) 4. Recompress the file as a new zip file 5. upload it    you will find the evil file is in `public/static/index/<your renamed folder name>/css/phpinfo.pHp` and `app/index/view/<your renamed folder name>/phpinfo.pHp`    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41777086/135379618-e0e99c6c-835d-4ad3-894a-c952bee2449e.png)  The second location: `应用中心->应用管理->上传应用` the post url is `/admin.php?s=pluginsadmin/upload.html` like the first location   1. download a casual plugin from [offical(https://shopxo.store/goods-75.html)](https://shopxo.store/goods-75.html) like this 2. unzip the zip 3. new a evil file named phpinfo.php in the `_controller_-><pluginname>->admin` folder 4. Recompress the file as a new zip file 5. upload it   you will find the evil file is in `app/plugins/freightfee/admin/phpinfo.php`  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41777086/135380655-a9525ba1-e437-4cdf-bce4-8709ca3ca6c8.png) The third location: `手机管理->小程序列表->主题安装` the post url is `/admin.php?s=appmini/themeupload.html`  the step is   1. new a evil file `phpinfo.php` and compress the file as a new zip file 2. upload it   you will find the evil file in `sourcecode/weixin/phpinfo.php` [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/41777086/135380855-6502b674-62e4-492d-9ac9-851fda808f5f.png) |
