The provided content describes an arbitrary file upload vulnerability in ShopXO version 2.2.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper file extension validation during the upload process in multiple locations, allowing an attacker to bypass security checks by manipulating filenames with mixed-case extensions (e.g., `phpinfo.pHp`).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload.
- Inadequate file extension validation.
- Insecure handling of compressed archives.
- Lack of sanitization of uploaded file names.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution via uploaded webshells.
- Full compromise of the application.
- Potential access to sensitive data and the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Uploading a specially crafted zip archive containing malicious PHP files using the theme installation, plugin installation, and app mini-program theme upload functionalities.
- The attacker can access the uploaded file on the server and trigger code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated administrator.
- The attacker needs access to the admin panel to reach the vulnerable file upload functionality in theme management, plugin management, or app mini-program management.
