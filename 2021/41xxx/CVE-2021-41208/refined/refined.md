Based on the provided information, this is a valid report for CVE-2021-41208.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is incomplete validation in the boosted trees code within TensorFlow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The code lacks proper validation, leading to potential issues such as:
  - Dereferencing `nullptr`s, causing crashes.
  - Triggering `CHECK`-failures, leading to denial of service.
  - Undefined behavior due to binding references to `nullptr`s.
  - Potential heap buffer reads and writes, depending on the specific API used and the arguments passed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
  - Denial of service due to crashes or `CHECK`-failures.
  - Undefined behavior, which might lead to unpredictable results and further vulnerabilities.
  - Information disclosure or arbitrary code execution through heap buffer read/write.

**Attack vectors:**
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific input data for the boosted trees operations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to provide input to the affected TensorFlow boosted trees APIs. This could occur through various channels depending on how the TensorFlow library is used in a given system.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `tensorflow/core/kernels/boosted_trees/stats_ops.cc` file.
- The fix was implemented in commit `5c8c9a8bfe750f9743d0c859bae112060b216f5c`.
- The fix was included in TensorFlow versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1, and will be part of 2.7.0.
- It is recommended to switch to the [TensorFlow Decision Forests](https://github.com/tensorflow/decision-forests) project, as the boosted trees API within TensorFlow is unmaintained and will be deprecated.
- The vulnerability was reported by the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
