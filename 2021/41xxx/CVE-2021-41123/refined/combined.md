# Survey Aggregate Metrics Accessible to Unauthorized Users

Moderate

## Package

WB.UI.Headquarters.dll
(Headquarters)

## Affected versions

<=21.09

## Patched versions

21.09.1

## Description

### Impact

Headquarters application publishes /metrics endpoint available to any user.

None of the survey answers are ever exposed, only the aggregate counters, including count of interviews, or count of assignments.

### Patches

Starting from version 21.09.1 the endpoint is turned off by default.

### Workarounds

* For Docker-based installations: pull the latest image and rebuild the container.
* For Windows-based installations:

  Locate the following line in Survey Solutions\Site\appsettings.ini file and modify value from `true` to `false`:

  `UseMetricsEndpoint = true`

  Then restart the application.

### **[SlyNet](/SlyNet)** commented [Oct 5, 2021](#advisory-comment-68700)

| It should be possible to mitigate issue without rebuilding of a container. Pass environment variable `HQ\_Metrics\_\_UseMetricsEndpoint=false` when running container |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
