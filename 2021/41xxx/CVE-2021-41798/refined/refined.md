{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The date value in search results was not being escaped before being displayed, which allowed for the injection of arbitrary HTML/JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that executes in the context of other users' browsers when they view search results. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can craft a malicious string and inject it into MediaWiki's configuration via the `MediaWiki:June` page, so that when the search results are displayed, this string is rendered without proper escaping.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have the ability to edit pages in the MediaWiki namespace (e.g. `MediaWiki:June` page), and also the ability to create articles that will show up in search results. The ability to create articles can often be done by any user, but editing the `MediaWiki:` namespace is often restricted to sysops or other higher privileged users."

      "branch": "REL1_31"
    }
  ],
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability lies in the way the date of an article is displayed in search results. The `userTimeAndDate` method was returning an unescaped date string which, when rendered in HTML, allowed for the execution of arbitrary JavaScript if the string contained HTML tags with a script payload."
