Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41695:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user-controlled input being directly used in an SQL query. Specifically, the `$ip` parameter, which is derived from HTTP headers, is used in an `UPDATE` query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application does not sanitize the IP address obtained from HTTP headers (`HTTP_CLIENT_IP` or `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`) before using it in an SQL query.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application trusts the user-provided values in the HTTP headers and doesn't sanitize the values before using them in the database queries. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary SQL Code Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious SQL code into the `UPDATE` query, potentially leading to data modification or deletion.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The provided example shows how an attacker can use the vulnerability to escalate their privileges to an admin level by setting the `admin` flag in the `users` table.
*   **Access Control Bypass:** The injection can also bypass access control restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The attack vector is through manipulating HTTP headers, specifically `HTTP_CLIENT_IP` or `HTTP_X_FORWARDED_FOR`.
*   **Crafted HTTP Request:** An attacker crafts a malicious HTTP request with a specific payload in the `CLIENT-IP` header to execute arbitrary SQL code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability in the context of the provided code snippet, since the `connect.php` logic runs unconditionally if the IP has changed.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of SQL syntax and the application's database structure to craft the malicious payload effectively.

**Additional Details:**
The provided content gives a detailed explanation of the vulnerability, including the vulnerable code snippets and an example of how to exploit it. The author states that the developer relies on the IP address format, assuming it will not contain any special characters. However, the application takes IP values from the headers that can be controlled by the attacker.
