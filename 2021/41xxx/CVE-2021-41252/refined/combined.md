# Cross-site scripting (XSS) from writer field content in the site frontend

Moderate

[bastianallgeier](/bastianallgeier)
published
GHSA-x7j7-qp7j-hw3q
Nov 16, 2021

## Package

composer

getkirby/cms
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

3.5.0-3.5.7.1

## Patched versions

3.5.8

## Description

### Impact

Kirby's [writer field](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/writer) stores its formatted content as HTML code. Unlike with other field types, it is not possible to [escape HTML special characters](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/templates/escaping) against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, otherwise the formatting would be lost.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability that allows to execute any kind of JavaScript code inside the site frontend or Panel session of other users. If the user is logged in to the Panel, a harmful script can for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim.

Because the writer field did not securely sanitize its contents on save, it was possible to inject malicious HTML code into the content file by sending it to Kirby's API directly without using the Panel. This malicious HTML code would then be displayed on the site frontend and executed in the browsers of site visitors and logged in users who are browsing the site.

This vulnerability is critical if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users. They can escalate their privileges if they get access to the Panel session of an admin user. Depending on your site, other JavaScript-powered attacks are possible.

You are *not* affected if you don't use the writer field in any of your blueprints. The attack can only be performed by logged-in users and only surfaces in the site frontend (i.e. in your templates). The Panel itself is unaffected and will not execute JavaScript that was injected into writer field content.

### Patches

We have patched the vulnerability in [Kirby 3.5.8](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/tag/3.5.8) by sanitizing all writer field contents on the backend whenever the content is modified via Kirby's API. Please update to this or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/) to fix the vulnerability.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Security release

This security release fixes two **cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities from writer field and image block content printed in the site frontend**.

**Severity:** medium (CVSS score 5.4)

### Writer field

#### Impact

Kirby's [writer field](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/writer) stores its formatted content as HTML code. Unlike with other field types, it is not possible to [escape HTML special characters](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/templates/escaping) against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks, otherwise the formatting would be lost.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability that allows to execute any kind of JavaScript code inside the site frontend or Panel session of other users. If the user is logged in to the Panel, a harmful script can for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim.

Because the writer field did not securely sanitize its contents on save, it was possible to inject malicious HTML code into the content file by sending it to Kirby's API directly without using the Panel. This malicious HTML code would then be displayed on the site frontend and executed in the browsers of site visitors and logged in users who are browsing the site.

This vulnerability is critical if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users. They can escalate their privileges if they get access to the Panel session of an admin user. Depending on your site, other JavaScript-powered attacks are possible.

You are *not* affected if you don't use the writer field in any of your blueprints. The attack can only be performed by logged-in users and only surfaces in the site frontend (i.e. in your templates). The Panel itself is unaffected and will not execute JavaScript that was injected into writer field content.

#### Patches

We have patched the vulnerability in this release by sanitizing all writer field contents on the backend whenever the content is modified via Kirby's API. Please update to this or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/) (including Kirby 3.6.0) to fix the vulnerability.

#### More information

You can find more details like the CVE ID of this vulnerability on its [security advisory page](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/security/advisories/GHSA-x7j7-qp7j-hw3q).

### Image block

#### Impact

Kirby's [blocks field](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks) stores structured data for each block. This data is then used in [block snippets](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks#block-snippets) to convert the blocks to HTML for use in your templates. We recommend to [escape HTML special characters](https://getkirby.com/docs/guide/templates/escaping) against cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.

Cross-site scripting (XSS) is a type of vulnerability that allows to execute any kind of JavaScript code inside the site frontend or Panel session of other users. If the user is logged in to the Panel, a harmful script can for example trigger requests to Kirby's API with the permissions of the victim.

The default snippet for the [image block](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/blocks/image) unfortunately did not use our escaping helper. This made it possible to include malicious HTML code in the source, alt and link fields of the image block, which would then be displayed on the site frontend and executed in the browsers of site visitors and logged in users who are browsing the site.

This vulnerability is critical if you might have potential attackers in your group of authenticated Panel users. They can escalate their privileges if they get access to the Panel session of an admin user. Depending on your site, other JavaScript-powered attacks are possible.

You are *not* affected if you don't use the blocks field or specifically the image block in any of your blueprints. You are also protected if you use a custom [block snippet](https://getkirby.com/docs/reference/panel/fields/blocks#block-snippets) that either escapes the printed values or doesn't use them. The attack can only be performed by logged-in users and only surfaces in the site frontend (i.e. in your templates). The Panel itself is unaffected and will not execute JavaScript that was injected into the image block content.

#### Patches

We have patched the vulnerability in this release by escaping special HTML characters in the output from the default image block snippet. Please update to this or a [later version](https://github.com/getkirby/kirby/releases/) (including Kirby 3.6.0) to fix the vulnerability.
