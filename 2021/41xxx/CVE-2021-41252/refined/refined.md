```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The writer field in Kirby CMS did not sanitize its content on save, allowing the injection of malicious HTML code through the API. This code was then executed in the browsers of site visitors.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of sanitization of user-provided content in the writer field."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of site visitors and logged-in users. For logged-in users, this could lead to privilege escalation by making requests to Kirby's API using the user's permissions. Other JavaScript-powered attacks are also possible.",
  "Attack vectors": "Malicious HTML code injection via Kirby's API into the writer field content.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to modify content through Kirby's API (but not necessarily through the panel)."
