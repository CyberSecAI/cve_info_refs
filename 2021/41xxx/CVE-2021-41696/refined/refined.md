Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41696:

**CVE-2021-41696: IDOR vulnerability in the password change procedure allows changing a password of any user**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the password change functionality. The `id` (user identifier) used in the SQL UPDATE query is directly taken from user input without proper validation or authorization checks.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **IDOR (Insecure Direct Object Reference):** The application uses user-supplied data (`$_POST['user']`) to directly access and modify user records in the database, without verifying if the user has the right to modify the specific user record.
    *   **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The password change function lacks authorization checks to ensure that the user initiating the request has the rights to modify the password of the target user ID.

*  **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can change the password of any user, including administrative accounts. This can lead to complete account takeover, unauthorized access to sensitive data, and potential compromise of the entire application.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker crafts a POST request to `/requests/user.php`, setting the `action` parameter to `changep`, and manipulates the `user` and `new_password` parameters to target a specific user.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of the structure of the POST request parameters used to change passwords.
    *   The attacker needs to know or guess the user ID of the target user whose password they want to change.
