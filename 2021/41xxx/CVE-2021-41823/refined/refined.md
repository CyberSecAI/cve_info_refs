- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Kemp Web Application Firewall (WAF) fails to properly sanitize or block specific XSS payloads.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The WAF is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) bypass due to insufficient filtering of user-supplied input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into web pages, which can be executed by other users. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing of user credentials
    - Defacement of web pages
    - Redirection to malicious websites
    - Other malicious activities
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through HTTP GET requests. The malicious payload is included in the URL as part of the path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the XSS payload, and the victim needs to access this URL through the WAF. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
