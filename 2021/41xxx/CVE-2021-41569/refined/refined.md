Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-41569:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the sample programs provided with SAS/IntrNet, specifically within the `sample.webcsf1.sas` program. This program uses the `DS2CSF` macro, which allows user-controlled macro variables to be passed to it.
*   The `csftyp` parameter, intended to control how a graph is rendered, can be manipulated to include the `ssfile1` function. This function, when included, embeds the content of a specified file into the HTML response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** The primary vulnerability is an LFI, as the application can be tricked into including the contents of arbitrary local files on the server into the web response.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to adequately sanitize user-provided input to the `csftyp` parameter, allowing the inclusion of the `ssfile1` function and the specification of file paths.
*   **Vulnerable Sample Code:** The inclusion of a vulnerable sample library by default in `appstart.sas` exposes the system to risk out-of-the-box.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An unauthorized attacker can use the vulnerability to retrieve sensitive information from the server that hosts SAS/IntrNet. This can include configuration files, password files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), environment variables, and other system-related files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to a vulnerable endpoint, specifically `/cgi-bin/broker`, and includes the vulnerable `csftyp` parameter in the query string.
*   **`ssfile1` Function Injection:**  The attacker injects the `ssfile1` function within the `csftyp` parameter, specifying the path to the target file to be included. URL encoding is required to bypass initial parsing, e.g., `csftyp=classic,+ssfile1%3d/etc/passwd`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the server running SAS/IntrNet.
*   **No Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring any authentication, meaning any external user that can reach the webserver can exploit the vulnerability.
*  **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameter**: The attacker needs to know to target the `csftyp` parameter with a specific syntax.

**Additional Details:**

*   The `appstart.sas` file includes a sample library by default, which leads to the vulnerable `sample.webcsf1.sas` program being accessible.
*   The vulnerability is present in SAS/IntrNet versions 9.4 build 1520 and earlier.
*   The `DS2CSF` macro sanitizes characters like ampersands, double quotes, semicolons, percent, and single quotes only if the procedure `appsrv unsafe` is configured, but does not sanitize spaces, commas, and equals characters.
*   The `_SERVICE` parameter needs to have a valid service or `default` to exploit the vulnerability
*   Example sensitive files:
    *   `/apps/SAS/v9.4/SASHome/CGIToolsForTheWebServer/9.4/websrv/sasweb/cgi-bin/broker.cfg`
    *   `/etc/passwd`
    *   `/apps/SAS/v9.4/SASHome/install.propertie`
    *   `/proc/self/environ`
    *   `/proc/version`

**Mitigation:**

*   Disable or remove the sample libraries if not needed in the hosting environment.
*   Implement a WAF (Web Application Firewall) rule to detect and block requests containing 'ssfile\*'.
