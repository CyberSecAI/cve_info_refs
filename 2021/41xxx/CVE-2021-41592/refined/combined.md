This implementation has been in production use on the Bitcoin mainnet since early 2018, with the launch of the [Blockstream Store](https://blockstream.com/2018/01/16/en-lightning-charge/).
We recommend getting started by experimenting on `testnet` (or `regtest`), but the implementation is considered stable and can be safely used on mainnet.

Any help testing the implementation, reporting bugs, or helping with outstanding issues is very welcome.
Don't hesitate to reach out to us on [Build-on-L2](https://community.corelightning.org), or on the implementation-specific [mailing list](https://lists.ozlabs.org/listinfo/c-lightning), or on the Lightning Network-wide [mailing list](https://lists.linuxfoundation.org/mailman/listinfo/lightning-dev), or on [CLN Discord](https://discord.gg/mE9s4rc5un), or on [CLN Telegram](https://t.me/lightningd), or on IRC at [dev](https://web.libera.chat/#lightning-dev)/[gen](https://web.libera.chat/#c-lightning) channel.

## Getting Started

Core Lightning only works on Linux and macOS, and requires a locally (or remotely) running `bitcoind` (version 25.0 or above) that is fully caught up with the network you're running on, and relays transactions (ie with `blocksonly=0`).
Pruning (`prune=n` option in `bitcoin.conf`) is partially supported, see [here](#pruning) for more details.

### Installation

There are 3 supported installation options:

* Installation of a pre-compiled binary from the [release page](https://github.com/ElementsProject/lightning/releases) on GitHub.
* Using one of the [provided docker images](https://hub.docker.com/r/elementsproject/lightningd/) on the Docker Hub.
* Compiling the source code yourself as described in the [installation documentation](/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/getting-started/getting-started/installation.md).

### Starting `lightningd`

#### Regtest (local, fast-start) Option

If you want to experiment with `lightningd`, there's a script to set
up a `bitcoind` regtest test network of two local lightning nodes,
which provides a convenient `start_ln` helper. See the notes at the top
of the `startup_regtest.sh` file for details on how to use it.

```
. contrib/startup_regtest.sh
```

#### Mainnet Option

To test with real bitcoin, you will need to have a local `bitcoind` node running:

```
bitcoind -daemon
```

Wait until `bitcoind` has synchronized with the network.

Make sure that you do not have `walletbroadcast=0` in your `~/.bitcoin/bitcoin.conf`, or you may run into trouble.
Notice that running `lightningd` against a pruned node may cause some issues if not managed carefully, see [below](#pruning) for more information.

You can start `lightningd` with the following command:

```
lightningd --network=bitcoin --log-level=debug
```

This creates a `.lightning/` subdirectory in your home directory: see `man -l doc/lightningd.8` (or <https://docs.corelightning.org/docs>) for more runtime options.

### Using The JSON-RPC Interface

Core Lightning exposes a [JSON-RPC 2.0](https://www.jsonrpc.org/specification) interface over a Unix Domain socket; the `lightning-cli` tool can be used to access it, or there is a [python client library](/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/contrib/pyln-client).

You can use `lightning-cli help` to print a table of RPC methods; `lightning-cli help <command>`
will offer specific information on that command.

Useful commands:

* [newaddr](/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/lightning-newaddr.7.md): get a bitcoin address to deposit funds into your lightning node.
* [listfunds](/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/lightning-listfunds.7.md): see where your funds are.
* [connect](/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/lightning-connect.7.md): connect to another lightning node.
* [fundchannel](/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/lightning-fundchannel.7.md): create a channel to another connected node.
* [invoice](/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/lightning-invoice.7.md): create an invoice to get paid by another node.
* [pay](/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/lightning-pay.7.md): pay someone else's invoice.
* [plugin](/ElementsProject/lightning/blob/master/doc/lightning-plugin.7.md): commands to control extensions.

### Care And Feeding Of Your New Lightning Node

Once you've started for the first time, there's a script called
`contrib/bootstrap-node.sh` which will connect you to other nodes on
the lightning network.

There are also numerous plugins available for Core Lightning which add
capabilities: in particular there's a collection at: <https://github.com/lightningd/plugins>

Including [helpme](https://github.com/lightningd/plugins/tree/master/helpme) which guides you through setting up
your first channels and customizing your node.

For a less reckless experience, you can encrypt the HD wallet seed:
see [HD wallet encryption](#hd-wallet-encryption).

You can also chat to other users at Discord [core-lightning](https://discord.gg/mE9s4rc5un);
we are always happy to help you get started!

### Opening A Channel

First you need to transfer some funds to `lightningd` so that it can
open a channel:

```
# Returns an address <address>
lightning-cli newaddr
```

`lightningd` will register the funds once the transaction is confirmed.

Alternatively you can generate a taproot address should your source of funds support it:

```
# Return a taproot address
lightning-cli newaddr p2tr
```

Confirm `lightningd` got funds by:

```
# Returns an array of on-chain funds.
lightning-cli listfunds
```

Once `lightningd` has funds, we can connect to a node and open a channel.
Let's assume the **remote** node is accepting connections at `<ip>`
(and optional `<port>`, if not 9735) and has the node ID `<node_id>`:

```
lightning-cli connect <node_id> <ip> [<port>]
lightning-cli fundchannel <node_id> <amount_in_satoshis>
```

This opens a connection and, on top of that connection, then opens a channel.
The funding transaction needs 3 confirmation in order for the channel to be usable, and 6 to be announced for others to use.
You can check the status of the channel using `lightning-cli listpeers`, which after 3 confirmations (1 on testnet) should say that `state` is `CHANNELD_NORMAL`; after 6 confirmations you can use `lightning-cli listchannels` to verify that the `public` field is now `true`.

### Sending and Receiving Payments

Payments in Lightning are invoice based.
The recipient creates an invoice with the expected `<amount>` in
millisatoshi (or `"any"` for a donation), a unique `<label>` and a
`<description>` the payer will see:

```
lightning-cli invoice <amount> <label> <description>
```

This returns some internal details, and a standard invoice string called `bolt11` (named after the [BOLT #11 lightning spec](https://github.com/lightning/bolts/blob/master/11-payment-encoding.md)).

The sender can feed this `bolt11` string to the `decodepay` command to see what it is, and pay it simply using the `pay` command:

```
lightning-cli pay <bolt11>
```

Note that there are lower-level interfaces (and more options to these
interfaces) for more sophisticated use.

## Configuration File

`lightningd` can be configured either by passing options via the command line, or via a configuration file.
Command line options will always override the values in the configuration file.

To use a configuration file, create a file named `config` within your top-level lightning directory or network subdirectory
(eg. `~/.lightning/config` or `~/.lightning/bitcoin/config`). See `man -l doc/lightningd-config.5`.

A sample configuration file is available at `contrib/config-example`.

## Further information

### Pruning

Core Lightning requires JSON-RPC access to a fully synchronized `bitcoind` in order to synchronize with the Bitcoin network.
Access to ZeroMQ is not required and `bitcoind` does not need to be run with `txindex` like other implementations.
The lightning daemon will poll `bitcoind` for new blocks that it hasn't processed yet, thus synchronizing itself with `bitcoind`.
If `bitcoind` prunes a block that Core Lightning has not processed yet, e.g., Core Lightning was not running for a prolonged period, then `bitcoind` will not be able to serve the missing blocks, hence Core Lightning will not be able to synchronize anymore and will be stuck.
In order to avoid this situation you should be monitoring the gap between Core Lightning's blockheight using `lightning-cli getinfo` and `bitcoind`'s blockheight using `bitcoin-cli getblockchaininfo`.
If the two blockheights drift apart it might be necessary to intervene.

### HD wallet encryption

You can encrypt the `hsm_secret` content (which is used to derive the HD wallet's master key) by passing the `--encrypted-hsm` startup argument, or by using the `hsmtool` (which you can find in the `tool/` directory at the root of this repo) with the `encrypt` method. You can unencrypt an encrypted `hsm_secret` using the `hsmtool` with the `decrypt` method.

If you encrypt your `hsm_secret`, you will have to pass the `--encrypted-hsm` startup option to `lightningd`. Once your `hsm_secret` is encrypted, you **will not** be able to access your funds without your password, so please beware with your password management. Also, beware of not feeling too safe with an encrypted `hsm_secret`: unlike for `bitcoind` where the wallet encryption can restrict the usage of some RPC command, `lightningd` always needs to access keys from the wallet which is thus **not locked** (yet), even with an encrypted BIP32 master seed.

Subject: [Lightning-dev] Miners Dust Inflation attacks on Lightning Network
Message-ID:
Lightning protocol supports a floating dust output selection at channel
creation, where each party declares a dust parameter applying to its local
transactions. The current spec doesn't enforce or recommend any bound on
this value, beyond the requirement of being lower that
`channel\_reserve\_satoshis`. When a HTLC is routed through the channel but
its value is under the local party dust limit, it's burned as fees and not
added to the commitment transaction. This rule, which makes LN a good
citizen of the Bitcoin blockchain comes at the price of more trust in your
counterparty..
Let's consider the following scenario. Mallory announces a channel to Alice
with dust-limit-satoshi set to 20% of channel value. Alice should accept
incoming channels as long as its under her implementation-specific
`max\_dust\_limit\_satoshis`. Now Mallory can route 4 dust-HTLCs to Mallet
through Alice claiming ~80% of channel value.
Mallory --> Alice --> Mallet
Mallet, in collusion with Mallory, can claim the whole set of HTLCs by
revealing the corresponding preimage for each. At the exact same time,
Mallory broadcast her latest commitment transaction on which there is \_no\_
HTLCs because all of them are dust. Alice can't claim them onchain but has
already paid Mallet forward.
At first-look, this attack doesn't seem economically rational because
dust-HTLCs are all committed as fees. But if you assume that Mallory can
collude with some mining pool, economics change completely because it's now
a almost zero-cost to add Mallory commitment transaction in a block,
hashrate won't be wasted. Fees are going back to the miner, and Alice is
still robbed. Mallory commitment transaction may stay in miner pool as long
block isn't found, without being announced to the rest of the network, and
HTLCs timelocks don't expire. Attack may still stealth if block isn't
signed. It's almost a zero-cost because if you assume block being full,
commitment transaction is now competing for block space and there is an
opportunity cost.
It's that kind of low-probability-and-hard-to-exploit-vulnerability but you
would prefer not having to think about your big LSP hub being targeted by a
rogue mining pool employee. Even if it's a really small mining pool, you
may batch the attack on multiple channels at once for one block found.
Deployment of Stratum V2 may make the attack easier by giving more leverage
to the local miner.
Mitigating may come by negotiating a new
`max\_dust\_htlc\_value\_in\_flight\_msat` enforced by HTLC recipient, therefore
expressing its maximum trust tolerance with regards to dust. Bearing a cost
on a HTLC holder will also render the attack more expensive, even if for
counter-measure efficiency you likely need a different order of magnitude
that spam-protection.
Cheers,
Antoine

Subject: [Lightning-dev] Full Disclosure: CVE-2021-41591/ CVE-2021-41592 /
CVE-2021-41593 "Dust HTLC Exposure Considered Harmful"
Message-ID:
Hi,
I'm writing a report to disclose specification-level vulnerabilities
affecting the Lightning implementations.
The vulnerabilities are expected to be patched in:
\* Eclair: v0.6.2+ (CVE-2021-41591)
\* LND: v0.13.3+ (CVE-2021-41592)
\* LDK: v0.0.102 (not released as production software yet)
The vulnerabilities are also affecting c-lightning (CVE-2021-41593).
Those vulnerabilities can be exploited in a wide range of attacks, going
from fee blackmailing of node operators, burning liquidity of your
competing LSPs or even stealing your counterparty channel balance if you
avail mining capabilities. Exercise of the vulnerability revealed that a
majority of the balance funds can be at loss.
Credit to Eugene Siegel (Crypt-iQ) for reporting the trimmed-to-dust
exploitation and multiple insights about attacks.
Thanks to Bastien Teinturier and Matt Corallo for numerous contributions
about mitigations development.
# Problem
The current BOLT specification only requires Alice's `dust\_limit\_satoshis`
(applied on Alice's commitment) to be under Alice's
`channel\_reserve\_satoshis` (applied on Bob). As those 2 parameters are
selectable by Alice, she can inflate the dust limit until reaching the
implementation-defined max value (e.g LND: 20% of chan capacity, LDK: 100%
of chan capacity).
Any in-flight incoming HTLC under Alice's dust limit will be converted as
miner fees on Alice's commitment. This HTLC is deducted from Bob's balance
and as such they're still owned by Bob, until resolution (i.e a RAA
removing the HTLC from Alice's commitment). This limitation only applies
per-HTLC. No implementation enforces a limit on the sum of in-flight HTLCs
burned as fees. Therefore, Alice is free to inflict a substantial loss to
Bob funds by publishing her commitment on-chain.
In-flight outgoing HTLC are also committed as fees on Bob's commitment if
they're under Bob's threshold. Alice can also exploit from this angle by
circular routing HTLCs until reaching Bob's
`max\_htlc\_value\_in\_flight\_msat`. Alice withholds HTLCs resolution until Bob
goes on-chain to timeout an offered HTLC or claim an accepted HTLC.
Dust HTLC processing can be also exploited at `update\_fee` reception.
As the BOLT3's fees computation encompasses the negotiated feerate from
`update\_fee` for the 2nd-stage HTLC fees to decide if the HTLC must be
trimmed, the amount of balance at risk is a function of current mempool
feerates.
The maximum of funds at risk on a counterparty commitment is:
counterparty's `max\_accepted\_htlcs` \* (`htlc\_success\_tx\_kw` \* opener's
`feerate\_per\_kw` + counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis`) + holder's
`max\_accepted\_htlcs` \* (`htlc\_timeout\_tx\_kw` \* opener's `feerate\_per\_kw` +
counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis`)
If the opener is also the attacker, the negotiated feerate can be
manipulated beyond the "honest" mempool feerates only upper bounded
implementation-defined value (before fixes, LDK: 2 \* high-feerate of our
fee-estimator). If the opener is the victim, the negotiated feerate is
still a safety concern in case of spontaneous mempool spikes.
Note, `anchors\_zero\_htlc\_fee` channels are not affected by the feerate
inflation as the trimmed-to-dust fee computation mechanism for 2nd-stage
HTLC is removed. They're still at risk of the sum of the HTLCs under the
dust limit being maliciously burned.
# Solution
A first mitigation is to verify the counterparty's announced
`dust\_limit\_satoshis` at channel opening (`open\_channel`/`accept\_channel`)
reception and reject if it's estimated too large (see #894)
For LDK, we choose the value of 660 satoshis as it's beyond the highest
dust threshold enforced by Bitcoin Core (p2pkh: 546) with a margin of
safety. Propagation of Lightning time-sensitive transactions shouldn't be
affected.
A second mitigation is to define a new configurable limit
`max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure` and apply this one at incoming and outgoing of
HTLC.
For LDK, we choose the value of 5 000 000 milli-satoshis as we gauged this
value as a substantial loss for our class of users. Setting this too low
may prevent the sending or receipt of low-value HTLCs on high-traffic
nodes. A node operator should fine-tune this value in function of what
qualifies as an acceptable loss.
We would like to ensure that the node isn't suddenly exposed to
significantly more trimmed balance if the feerate increases when we have
several HTLCs pending which are near the dust limit.
To achieve this goal, we introduce a new `dust\_buffer\_feerate` defined as
the maximum of either 2530 sats per kWU or 125% of the current
`feerate\_per\_kw` (implementation-defined values).
Then, upon an incoming HTLC, if the HTLC's `amount\_msat` is inferior to the
counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis` plus the HTLC-timeout fee at the
`dust\_buffer\_feerate`. If the `amount\_msat` plus the
`dust\_balance\_on\_counterparty\_tx` is superior to `max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure`,
the HTLC should be failed once it's committed.
Upon an outgoing HTLC, if the HTLC's `amount\_msat` is inferior to the
counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis` plus the HTLC-success fee at the
`dust\_buffer\_feerate`. If the `amount\_msat` plus the
`dust\_balance\_on\_counterparty\_tx` is superior to `max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure`,
the HTLC should not be sent and fail without forwarding.
The check symmetry must also be applied on holder commitment transactions.
See PR #919 for more details.
A last mitigation is ensuring that at `update\_fee` reception, the pending
`dust\_balance` at the new proposed feerate isn't superior to
`max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure\_msat`.
# Background
The dust limit is a base layer policy stopping the relay of a transaction
if one of its outputs is under a given threshold. The goal of this policy
is to prevent the pollution of the UTXO set with low-value outputs and as
such increase the amount of work done by full-nodes.
Lightning commitment transactions should be able to propagate at any point
during the channel lifetime to unilaterally enforce on-chain a balance. A
Lightning commitment transaction with one of its outputs below the dust
limit would fail to relay and thus jeopardizes funds safety.
To prevent this, BOLT2 requires counterparties to announce a
`dust\_limit\_satoshis` during channel opening (at
`open\_channel`/`accept\_channel` exchange). This `dust\_limit\_satoshis` must
be under the same party's `channel\_reserve\_satoshis`. This value is static
for the channel lifetime.
During commitment signatures exchange, each counterparty's limit is applied
on each counterparty's commitment (e.g A's `dust\_limit\_satoshis` is applied
on A's commitment, though both A and B have to generate and sign the
transaction). An output below this limit is trimmed to fees and won't
materialize on the commitment.
The specification didn't require that the `open\_channel`/`accept\_channel`
receiver verify that the announced `dust\_limit\_satoshis` isn't too large.
The specification didn't require that the sum of the dust HTLC committed as
fees was verified against an upper bound.
# Discovery
Vulnerabilities around our dust HTLC processing have been known for years
by some LN developers/researchers.
During Q1 2019, private discussions on the Rust-Lightning-side (LDK before
marketing rebranding) about potential safety risks around dust HTLC
processing.
In November 2019, Rusty Russell (c-lightning) opened an issue against the
specification mentioning the lack of check of counterparty's dust limit
(#696).
In May 2020, I published a high-level attack scenario "Miners Dust
Inflation attacks on Lightning Network", leveraging this lack.
In February 2021, I did a test of the first vulnerability against LND
software and successfully burnt the majority of the targeted node balance
in fees. As it sounds to me like a check missing in the specification, I
notified CL/LND/Eclair/LDK maintainers. Mitigations started to be developed
on the LDK-side.
In July 2021, in the context of `option\_dusty\_htlcs\_uncounted` discussions,
Eugene Spiegel (LND) reported on how to exploit the trimmed-to-dust
mechanism at `update\_fee` reception. Discussions followed on the best way
to mitigate this new vector.
During August 2021, mitigations were developed and released on the
LDK-side. vulnerabilities were disclosed to other Lightning projects (Muun
wallet, Electrum). From the LDK-side, a public disclosure date was proposed.
Still during August 2021, the Bitcoin Core dust limit was actively
discussed on the mailing list. Changes of this dust limit would have
affected the ongoing development of the mitigations.
While this report highlights the lack of well-defined communication process
across Lightning teams, developers from 3 different implementations have
actively participated in the vulnerabilities diagnostic and mitigations
development of those long-standing specification issues affecting the whole
Lightning ecosystem.
All mistakes and opinions are my own and please verify any information
reported.

# Good Griefing: A Lingering Vulnerability On Lightning Network That Still Needs Fixing

The potential for “griefing” attacks on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is a serious threat. Here’s how they work and why they deserve a fix.

* Author:[Jestopher](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/jestopher)
* Publish date:Jan 18, 2021

![The Lightning Network has unleashed an entirely new set of accounting, audit and tax challenges. But how will they be resolved?](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/t_share/MTc5Mjk3ODA4NjI0Nzg5MTg3/bitcoin-lightning-network-accounting-challenges.jpg)

The Lightning Network has unleashed an entirely new set of accounting, audit and tax challenges. But how will they be resolved?

What happens when your Lightning Network routing node is fed with garbage transactions that never resolve? In short, it causes a lot of grief for routing nodes. What was once a smooth, global payment system can be locked up with trivial effort from a savvy script writer.

Working in a small team of routing nodes, we successfully ran a test of the attack with real funds and demonstrated the "[griefing](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/62829/what-does-griefing-mean)" attack described by [Joost Jager](https://github.com/lightningequipment/circuitbreaker). The attack is called a grief attack since it is not a theft of funds, but it causes a victim's Lightning funds to be frozen: a major upset. What we found is that griefing is a serious threat to large "wumbo" channels expecting to earn a yield on their bitcoin, only to have their funds frozen for a period of time.

This is mostly a grief attack: no loss of funds, but the victim may be forced to pay for an expensive channel force close. This is a known vulnerability on mainnet Lightning and it needs to be understood and prioritized, especially at this early market stage of Bitcoin's Lightning Network.

Thanks to Clark Burkhardt and Phillip Sheppard for their willingness to participate in this test and to Jager for his tireless work to bring attention and priority to this vulnerability. Jager played the role of the attacker for our demonstration, while Burkhardt and Sheppard joined me as connected victim routing nodes.

## How The Attack Works

The attacker saturates one (or several) channel(s) with Hashed Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs) that don't resolve as a finalized payment. These are a special breed of HTLCs known as HODL invoices. Only 483 of these unresolved HTLCs are required to overwhelm a channel per direction. Once those HTLCs are in the channel, any transactions using that same channel direction are impossible, including a transaction to cooperatively close that channel.

In theory, an attacker could contact the victim (perhaps via a keysend message or in an "onion blob") and demand a ransom be paid to halt the attack. Once the ransom is paid, the attacker could remove the unresolved payments, ending the attack. The attack can be sustained indefinitely, halting all routing and payment activity in that channel. This freezes the funds in the Lightning channel.

Both directions of payments can be stalled in a channel by using 483 HTLCs in each direction, both inbound and outbound.

The amount in blue is the local balance in sats, the amount in green is the remote balance in sats owned by Burkhardt. Source: [Thunderhub](https://thunderhub.io/).

## Why Would An Attacker Do Something Like This?

The first motive that comes to mind is to demand a ransom. This attack causes pain for the victim and paying a ransom may be attractive to a victim, even without assurance that the attack would stop. Contacting the victim might be risky for an attacker, but a ransom payment might not be the only reason someone would do this.

A secondary incentive for launching a griefing attack would be to disrupt routing competition. Jamming a competitor's route could create more demand for a route owned by an attacker.

As a benchmark, consider that Lightning Labs' Loop node has an ongoing demand for liquidity for which it will sometimes pay a 2,500 parts per million of the payment (ppm) (0.25 percent) fee rate. In my experience, they would normally exhaust 16 million sats’ worth of liquidity in about two weeks (5.2 percent annual percentage rate), but that is with competition present.

If an attacker could disable any competing route with lower fee rates, Loop may be willing to pay a higher fee rate (since the supply of liquidity is now reduced). Let's say Loop would pay 3,000 ppm (0.3 percent), as well as use that liquidity more quickly since no other channels are functioning. Loop might use that liquidity in half the time, say one week. The attacker would more than double their usual yield to 15.6 percent APR in this example. The only cost to the attacker is the cost of running a script on an existing channel and the psychological cost of doing something immoral/damaging to the Lightning Network. With a single attacker channel, a malicious actor could jam about nine channels (see [Jager’s tweets about this](https://twitter.com/joostjgr/status/1309516114628620288?s=19)).

## What Would The Victim Of This Attack Experience?

The victim of this attack wouldn't really know that this attack was happening unless they had some special alerts set for pending HTLCs. For Thunderhub users (a highly recommended tool), the home screen will show a chart of pending HTLCs as well as a warning stating that channels can only hold 483 pending HTLCs.

Source: Thunderhub

In practice, my node quickly became unreliable and experienced several app crashes, including Thunderhub, which was the only app to notify me of the problem. Then, thanks to my “Balance of Satoshis” Telegram bot, I got a channel closing notification. The channel under attack force-closed itself! That was not supposed to be part of the experiment. (For more technical information on the involuntary force close, see below for additional force-close data.)

## What Can The Victim Do To Stop A Griefing Attack?

Once an attack starts, a victim essentially can't do anything to stop it. The only alternatives available to halt an ongoing attack would be to force-close the channel being attacked, which means that the terrorists win.

To add insult to injury, force-closing the channel will push the unresolved payments to the on-chain transaction data, triggering secondary on-chain transactions for the initiator of the force close. At 50 sats/vbyte and 483 on-chain transactions, that’s easily a 1 million sat price tag to force close a single channel under attack (a $368 channel close fee at today's prices). The multiple on-chain transactions only occur if the output is above the minimum payment "dust" limit. (See [this example](https://mempool.space/testnet/tx/0be93eff334ecaebc5a2ff783373f96dbc0ef7b3df1a5daa37db96b419eb1305) on testnet.)

## How To Prevent A Griefing Attack

Jager has been working on a proof-of-concept program to help isolate and fight attackers. He's calling his program "[Circuitbreaker](https://github.com/lightningequipment/circuitbreaker)." The Circuitbreaker works at a network level, which unfortunately means that *everyone* has to participate for it to be effective.

Beyond that, this issue needs prioritization and attention from dedicated engineers/developers to find better solutions. There have also been some good discussions on modifying the protocol in the Bitcoin Optech newsletter (issue #122 or #126).

This attack can be executed today. It is a miracle that it hasn't already been used maliciously. It's a reflection of the incentives for those using Lightning today so that it can become an open, universal payment network. Please share this post as you see fit to encourage and inspire more work to fix this problem before it causes real harm.

## Additional Technical Information About The Involuntary Force-Close

Here are the logs from my node running LND 0.11 at the moment that the above mentioned involuntary force-close occured:

> 2020-11-26 21:24:47.374 [ERR] HSWC: ChannelLink(657759:561:0): failing link: ChannelPoint (c37bec006b18df172698a84739ca47128935e0a8666fecd1a843e49b01db207c:0): received error from peer: chan\_id=7c20db019be443a8d1ec6f66a8e035891247ca3947a8982617df186b00ec7bc3, err=rejected commitment: commit\_height=455, invalid\_commit\_sig=3044022076fd65191eb6305b723fa6012be378413b6326e2786c38db58b4c02e1f3999d202207605ca31de8b4c5b1d9cd20dc1581dfa2383e0b4e06c8ad4f718ab5c434d8cf5, commit\_tx=02000000017c20db019be443a8d1ec6f66a8e035891247ca3947a8982617df186b00ec7bc300000000008a792e8002210d0000000000002200201031cf10a1efef261edd3d0a1a6a953b27bc25bd7150bb2b07afdc69805e02157213000000000000160014de650929042bef58b71783ae1a44834a902a8f2d542ca720, sig\_hash=4e0fb804c74376020e4c44a60969b9206eb0aaa9a89b76017d60f23ad5cf63e5 with error: remote error

The logs show an "invalid\_commit\_sig" which is a known issue in LND. Supposedly, this can happen upon reconnecting and isn't a direct result of the channel jamming. The volume of pending HTLCs unfortunately makes it more likely to happen. Jager helped explain the process as channel jamming --> endless payment loop (bug) --> node down --> reconnect --> invalid commit sig (bug) --> channel force-close.

The "endless" loop bug is a known bug that occurs when the HTLC limit is reached and an additional HTLC is sent. Instead of ending in a payment failure, LND will continue to attempt the payment in a loop. To help with this bug, see [LND issue #4656](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/4656).

> # Problem
>
> The current BOLT specification only requires Alice's `dust\_limit\_satoshis`
> (applied on Alice's commitment) to be under Alice's
> `channel\_reserve\_satoshis` (applied on Bob). As those 2 parameters are
> selectable by Alice, she can inflate the dust limit until reaching the
> implementation-defined max value (e.g LND: 20% of chan capacity, LDK: 100%
> of chan capacity).
>
> Any in-flight incoming HTLC under Alice's dust limit will be converted as
> miner fees on Alice's commitment. This HTLC is deducted from Bob's balance
> and as such they're still owned by Bob, until resolution (i.e a RAA
> removing the HTLC from Alice's commitment). This limitation only applies
> per-HTLC. No implementation enforces a limit on the sum of in-flight HTLCs
> burned as fees. Therefore, Alice is free to inflict a substantial loss to
> Bob funds by publishing her commitment on-chain.
>
> In-flight outgoing HTLC are also committed as fees on Bob's commitment if
> they're under Bob's threshold. Alice can also exploit from this angle by
> circular routing HTLCs until reaching Bob's
> `max\_htlc\_value\_in\_flight\_msat`. Alice withholds HTLCs resolution until Bob
> goes on-chain to timeout an offered HTLC or claim an accepted HTLC.
>
> Dust HTLC processing can be also exploited at `update\_fee` reception.
>
> As the BOLT3's fees computation encompasses the negotiated feerate from
> `update\_fee` for the 2nd-stage HTLC fees to decide if the HTLC must be
> trimmed, the amount of balance at risk is a function of current mempool
> feerates.
>
> The maximum of funds at risk on a counterparty commitment is:
>
> counterparty's `max\_accepted\_htlcs` \* (`htlc\_success\_tx\_kw` \* opener's
> `feerate\_per\_kw` + counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis`) + holder's
> `max\_accepted\_htlcs` \* (`htlc\_timeout\_tx\_kw` \* opener's `feerate\_per\_kw` +
> counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis`)
>
> If the opener is also the attacker, the negotiated feerate can be
> manipulated beyond the "honest" mempool feerates only upper bounded
> implementation-defined value (before fixes, LDK: 2 \* high-feerate of our
> fee-estimator). If the opener is the victim, the negotiated feerate is
> still a safety concern in case of spontaneous mempool spikes.
>
> Note, `anchors\_zero\_htlc\_fee` channels are not affected by the feerate
> inflation as the trimmed-to-dust fee computation mechanism for 2nd-stage
> HTLC is removed. They're still at risk of the sum of the HTLCs under the
> dust limit being maliciously burned.

> # Solution
>
> A first mitigation is to verify the counterparty's announced
> `dust\_limit\_satoshis` at channel opening (`open\_channel`/`accept\_channel`)
> reception and reject if it's estimated too large (see #894)
>
> For LDK, we choose the value of 660 satoshis as it's beyond the highest
> dust threshold enforced by Bitcoin Core (p2pkh: 546) with a margin of
> safety. Propagation of Lightning time-sensitive transactions shouldn't be
> affected.
>
> A second mitigation is to define a new configurable limit
> `max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure` and apply this one at incoming and outgoing of
> HTLC.
>
> For LDK, we choose the value of 5 000 000 milli-satoshis as we gauged this
> value as a substantial loss for our class of users. Setting this too low
> may prevent the sending or receipt of low-value HTLCs on high-traffic
> nodes. A node operator should fine-tune this value in function of what
> qualifies as an acceptable loss.
>
> We would like to ensure that the node isn't suddenly exposed to
> significantly more trimmed balance if the feerate increases when we have
> several HTLCs pending which are near the dust limit.
>
> To achieve this goal, we introduce a new `dust\_buffer\_feerate` defined as
> the maximum of either 2530 sats per kWU or 125% of the current
> `feerate\_per\_kw` (implementation-defined values).
>
> Then, upon an incoming HTLC, if the HTLC's `amount\_msat` is inferior to
> the counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis` plus the HTLC-timeout fee at the
> `dust\_buffer\_feerate`. If the `amount\_msat` plus the
> `dust\_balance\_on\_counterparty\_tx` is superior to `max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure`,
> the HTLC should be failed once it's committed.
>
> Upon an outgoing HTLC, if the HTLC's `amount\_msat` is inferior to the
> counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis` plus the HTLC-success fee at the
> `dust\_buffer\_feerate`. If the `amount\_msat` plus the
> `dust\_balance\_on\_counterparty\_tx` is superior to `max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure`,
> the HTLC should not be sent and fail without forwarding.
>
> The check symmetry must also be applied on holder commitment transactions.
> See PR #919 for more details.
>
> A last mitigation is ensuring that at `update\_fee` reception, the pending
> `dust\_balance` at the new proposed feerate isn't superior to
> `max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure\_msat`.
>
> # Background
>
> The dust limit is a base layer policy stopping the relay of a transaction
> if one of its outputs is under a given threshold. The goal of this policy
> is to prevent the pollution of the UTXO set with low-value outputs and as
> such increase the amount of work done by full-nodes.
>
> Lightning commitment transactions should be able to propagate at any point
> during the channel lifetime to unilaterally enforce on-chain a balance. A
> Lightning commitment transaction with one of its outputs below the dust
> limit would fail to relay and thus jeopardizes funds safety.
>
> To prevent this, BOLT2 requires counterparties to announce a
> `dust\_limit\_satoshis` during channel opening (at
> `open\_channel`/`accept\_channel` exchange). This `dust\_limit\_satoshis` must
> be under the same party's `channel\_reserve\_satoshis`. This value is static
> for the channel lifetime.
>
> During commitment signatures exchange, each counterparty's limit is
> applied on each counterparty's commitment (e.g A's `dust\_limit\_satoshis` is
> applied on A's commitment, though both A and B have to generate and sign
> the transaction). An output below this limit is trimmed to fees and won't
> materialize on the commitment.
>
> The specification didn't require that the `open\_channel`/`accept\_channel`
> receiver verify that the announced `dust\_limit\_satoshis` isn't too large.
>
> The specification didn't require that the sum of the dust HTLC committed
> as fees was verified against an upper bound.
>
> # Discovery
>
> Vulnerabilities around our dust HTLC processing have been known for years
> by some LN developers/researchers.
>
> During Q1 2019, private discussions on the Rust-Lightning-side (LDK before
> marketing rebranding) about potential safety risks around dust HTLC
> processing.
>
> In November 2019, Rusty Russell (c-lightning) opened an issue against the
> specification mentioning the lack of check of counterparty's dust limit
> (#696).
>
> In May 2020, I published a high-level attack scenario "Miners Dust
> Inflation attacks on Lightning Network", leveraging this lack.
>
> In February 2021, I did a test of the first vulnerability against LND
> software and successfully burnt the majority of the targeted node balance
> in fees. As it sounds to me like a check missing in the specification, I
> notified CL/LND/Eclair/LDK maintainers. Mitigations started to be developed
> on the LDK-side.
>
> In July 2021, in the context of `option\_dusty\_htlcs\_uncounted`
> discussions, Eugene Spiegel (LND) reported on how to exploit the
> trimmed-to-dust mechanism at `update\_fee` reception. Discussions followed
> on the best way to mitigate this new vector.
>
> During August 2021, mitigations were developed and released on the
> LDK-side. vulnerabilities were disclosed to other Lightning projects (Muun
> wallet, Electrum). From the LDK-side, a public disclosure date was proposed.
>
> Still during August 2021, the Bitcoin Core dust limit was actively
> discussed on the mailing list. Changes of this dust limit would have
> affected the ongoing development of the mitigations.
>
> While this report highlights the lack of well-defined communication
> process across Lightning teams, developers from 3 different
> implementations have actively participated in the vulnerabilities
> diagnostic and mitigations development of those long-standing specification
> issues affecting the whole Lightning ecosystem.
