Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-41619:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to specify arbitrary Java Virtual Machine (JVM) startup options through the Gradle Enterprise administration interface. Certain JVM options, like `-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError`, allow the execution of a command on the host when a specific event occurs (in this case, an out-of-memory error).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted JVM startup option configuration in the application's admin interface.
- Specifically, the ability to use options such as `-XX:OnOutOfMemoryError` to specify commands for execution on the host system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker with administrative access to the Gradle Enterprise application can execute arbitrary commands on the host system where the application is running.
- Full control over the host is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to gain administrative access to the Gradle Enterprise application's admin interface.
- Once admin access is obtained, the attacker uses the JVM startup configuration to specify malicious startup options.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have administrative access to the Gradle Enterprise application. This means they need valid admin credentials.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Gradle Enterprise versions 2020.4 through 2021.1.2.
- The vulnerability was mitigated in Gradle Enterprise version 2021.1.2 where these options are ignored.
