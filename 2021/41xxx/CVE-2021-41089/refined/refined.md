Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-41089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `docker cp` command in Moby (Docker Engine). When copying files into a specifically crafted container, it can lead to unintended changes in Unix file permissions on the host's file system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Preservation of Permissions:** The `docker cp` operation does not correctly preserve the file permissions when copying files into a specially crafted container.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Widened Access:** Exploitation of this vulnerability can result in file permissions on the host's file system being modified, potentially widening access to these files for other users.
*   **Note:** The vulnerability does *not* directly allow reading, modification, or execution of files without another cooperating process. It only changes permissions making further exploitation easier.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves using the `docker cp` command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to copy files into a specially crafted container using `docker cp`.
*   The attacker must have a low level of privileges on the system.
*  The attacker must have access to a docker environment.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was addressed in Moby (Docker Engine) version 20.10.9.
*   The vulnerability is considered to have a **Low** severity
*   The fix involves ensuring the `chrootarchive` function does not create parent directories outside of the chroot environment.
