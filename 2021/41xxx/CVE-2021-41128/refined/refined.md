Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41128:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-generated input when creating CSV files. Specifically, the application did not encode or escape characters that, when interpreted by spreadsheet software like Microsoft Excel or LibreOffice Calc, would be treated as formulas rather than plain text.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSV Injection (also known as Formula Injection):**  The primary vulnerability is that when a CSV file contains cells starting with characters such as `=`, `+`, `-`, or `@`, spreadsheet software interprets the content as a formula. This allows for malicious formulas to be embedded in the CSV data.
- The vulnerability exists because the `csv` library used in the `hygeia` project didn't automatically escape/encode these characters to be interpreted as plain text.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** Maliciously crafted formulas could be used to execute arbitrary code on the user's machine through vulnerabilities in spreadsheet software (e.g., CVE-2014-3524) or by exploiting user's tendency to ignore security warnings.
- **Data Exfiltration:** Malicious formulas can be used to extract and exfiltrate data from the opened spreadsheet, or from other open spreadsheets, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- **Computer Hijacking:** Exploitation could lead to the hijacking of the user's computer if the malicious formulas are able to execute code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **User-Generated Input:** An attacker inputs malicious formulas into fields that are then exported to a CSV file.
- **CSV Export:** The application exports the data, including the malicious formulas, into a CSV file.
- **Victim Interaction:** A user opens the exported CSV file using spreadsheet software.
- **Formula Execution:** The spreadsheet software interprets the cells starting with `=`,`+`,`-`,`@` as formulas and executes the malicious commands or scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious content into fields that are later exported into a CSV.
- The attacker doesn't necessarily need direct access to the victim's computer, as the exploitation occurs when the victim opens the manipulated CSV file.

**Mitigation:**
The fix was to add an option to the `csv` library to escape or encode formulas by prepending a single quote and wrapping each cell field in double quotes.
Specifically:
- Wrap each cell field in double quotes.
- Prepend each cell field with a single quote.
- Escape every double quote using an additional double quote.
