Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41329:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how Seq generates cache keys for queries, specifically those using `in` clauses.
*   When the `in` clause contains only constants, the system pre-computes and inlines the array of constants instead of generating an expression that builds the array at runtime.
*   The code responsible for creating cache keys does not correctly handle this inlined constant array, leading to collisions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cache Key Collision:** Queries that differ *only* in the content of their `in` clauses (when those clauses use only constants) can generate identical cache keys.
*   **Information Exposure:**  Due to cache collisions, a user could potentially receive cached results from a query executed by another user. This could expose data that the user should not have access to based on their view filter settings.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Incorrect Query Results:** Users may receive incorrect results when queries with different `in` clause values (containing only constants) collide in the cache.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  A user with restricted access (defined through view filters) may be exposed to cached query results of another user with different access restrictions. This exposure can occur if the only difference in their queries is the contents of the `in` clause in the view filter.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when users execute queries that differ only by the values within an `in` clause in a view filter, where the values are all constants.
*   This primarily affects `group by time()` queries, particularly those used in dashboards.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to have an account with restricted access through view filters that use `in` clauses or arrays, where the values are all constants.
*   The attacker needs to be able to execute queries that would normally be cached.
*   The attacker must execute a query that differs only by the content of the in clause when compared with a query previously executed by a user with different restrictions, and the queries need to meet the criteria for being cached (using time-based grouping, or are executed in dashboards).

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue specifically affects Seq versions up to 2021.2.
*   The vulnerability is mitigated in version 2021.2.6459.
*   The vulnerability is most likely to affect installations that heavily rely on view filters with `in` clauses and use `group by time()` queries or dashboards.

**Mitigation:**

*   The primary mitigation is to update to Seq version 2021.2.6459 or later.
