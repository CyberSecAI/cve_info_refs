### **[nblumhardt](/nblumhardt)** commented [Sep 15, 2021](#issue-997607235)

| Seq uses time-slice caching to speed up `group by time()` queries and a few others, in particular, those that drive [Dashboards](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/dashboards).  Behind the scenes, cache entries are keyed based on the clauses of the query, active signals, and so-on.  A bug in recent Seq versions up to 2021.2 causes the keys generated for `in` clauses to collide, when all elements of the detected set are constants.  For example:   * `select count(*) from stream where @Level in ['warn'] group by time(1m)` and * `select count(*) from stream where @Level in ['error', 'critical'] group by time(1m)`   will generate the same cache key, and thus produce incorrect results when two cacheable queries differ only in this respect.  The bug is caused by inlining of arrays of constants: instead of `['warn']` generating an expression that constructs an array with a constant element, the array is precomputed and inlined as a constant itself.  The code that subsequently generates query cache keys does not properly account for this case.  Query cache entries will not collide if:   * The queries do not group by `time` and are not executed from a dashboard, * The queries run over different signals, * Any other aspect of the query, including the `select`, `where`, `group by`, `having`, and `order by` clauses, differ in any way. |

| Datalust requested a CVE number for this bug because of the possibility of query collisions exposing the query results of one user to another, when the data visible to the second user should be limited by their [view filter](https://docs.datalust.co/docs/managing-users#view-filters).  The information exposure may occur when a query executed by a user with restricted access differs from an earlier query, executed by a user with different restrictions, *only* by the contents of an array or `in` clause that appears in the restricted user's view filter.  For example, if user 1 has view filter `Project in ['project-1', 'project-2']` and user 2 has a view filter `Project in ['project-3']`, then each user may see cached results of a query `select distinct(CustomerName) group by time(1h)` belonging to the other user, if they execute these queries in turn.  We expect the real-world impact of this bug to be low because:   * Only installations that restrict lower-permission users via view filters are affected, * Only view filters based on `in` clauses or arrays are affected, * Only `group by time()` and dashboard-based queries are affected, * Cache collisions require recent execution of an identical query with the same time bucketing, over an overlapping interval, with no further restrictions or operators applied.   If you need any assistance determining whether this issue is likely to have occurred on the Seq instances you manage, please reach out via our support address. |
