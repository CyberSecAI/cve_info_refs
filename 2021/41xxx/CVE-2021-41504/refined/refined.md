    "root_cause": "The use of basic authentication and digest authentication for the devices command interface in D-Link cameras.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use of basic authentication allows attack vectors that may compromise the cameras configuration.",
      "Use of digest-authentication may allow further attack vectors that may compromise the cameras configuration." ,

    "additional_notes": "The identified vulnerabilities were reported by Hristo Georgiev, Azad Mustafa, and Chuan Qin. The devices have reached their End of Life (EOL) / End of Service Life (EOS), and D-Link recommends retiring and replacing them. The recommendation to mitigate the authentication issue is that the devices should support https. The stack overflow vulnerability on DCS-932L can lead to a DDoS attack."
