[PATCH] Fix account takeover through CSRF attack

```
This commit fixes an account takeover vulnerability when [Rails
`protect_from_forgery`](<https://api.rubyonrails.org/classes/ActionController/RequestForgeryProtection/ClassMethods.html>)
method is both:

- Executed whether as:
  - A `before_action` callback (the default)
  - A `prepend_before_action` (option `prepend: true`) before the
  `:load_object` hook in `Spree::UsersController` (most likely order to
  find).

- Configured to use `:null_session` or `:reset_session`
  strategies (`:null_session` is the default in case the no strategy is
  given, but `rails --new` generated skeleton use `:exception`).

Before this commit, the user was fetched in a `prepend_before_action`
hook named `:load_object`. I.e., the user was loaded into an instance
variable before touching the session as a safety countermeasure. As the
request went forward, `#update` was called on that instance variable.

The `:exception` strategy prevented the issue as, even if the user was
still fetched, the request was aborted before the update phase. On the
other hand, prepending `:protect_from_forgery` after the `:load_object`
hook (not very likely, as `ApplicationController` is loaded in
the first place and it's the most likely place to have that definition)
wiped the session before trying to fetch the user from it.

We could have fixed the most likely issue by just using a
`before_action` for `:load_object`, but it's safer not to rely on the
order of callbacks at all.

# Authentication Bypass by CSRF Weakness

Critical

[damianlegawiec](/damianlegawiec)
published
GHSA-26xx-m4q2-xhq8
Nov 17, 2021

## Package

bundler

spree\_auth\_devise
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

< 4.4.1

## Patched versions

4.0.1, 4.1.1, 4.2.1, 4.4.1

## Description

### Impact

CSRF vulnerability that allows user account takeover.

All applications using any version of the frontend component of `spree_auth_devise` are affected if `protect_from_forgery` method is both:

* Executed whether as:
  + A before\_action callback (the default)
  + A prepend\_before\_action (option prepend: true given) before the :load\_object hook in Spree::UserController (most likely order to find).
* Configured to use :null\_session or :reset\_session strategies (:null\_session is the default in case the no strategy is given, but rails --new generated skeleton use :exception).

That means that applications that haven't been configured differently from what it's generated with Rails aren't affected.

Thanks [@waiting-for-dev](https://github.com/waiting-for-dev) for reporting and providing a patch 👏

### Patches

Spree 4.3 users should update to spree\_auth\_devise 4.4.1

Spree 4.2 users should update to spree\_auth\_devise 4.2.1

Spree 4.1 users should update to spree\_auth\_devise 4.1.1

Older Spree version users should update to spree\_auth\_devise 4.0.1

### Workarounds

If possible, change your strategy to :exception:

```
class ApplicationController < ActionController::Base
  protect_from_forgery with: :exception
end
```

Add the following to`config/application.rb` to at least run the `:exception` strategy on the affected controller:

```
config.after_initialize do
  Spree::UsersController.protect_from_forgery with: :exception
end
```
