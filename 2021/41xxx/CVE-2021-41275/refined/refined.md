Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41275:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the interaction between Rails' `protect_from_forgery` method and the `:load_object` hook in `Spree::UsersController`, specifically when `protect_from_forgery` is configured to use `:null_session` or `:reset_session` strategies.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CSRF vulnerability:** The core issue is a Cross-Site Request Forgery vulnerability.
*   **Incorrect callback order:** The `load_object` hook, which fetches the user, was executed before the CSRF protection when configured as a `prepend_before_action`.
*   **Vulnerable session handling:**  When using `:null_session` or `:reset_session`, the session was wiped *before* the user object was fetched. If a forged request targeted the user update, the request would pass CSRF protection because the session was wiped and the user would be fetched based on the parameters of the forged request, not the authenticated user.
*   **Reliance on callback order:** The vulnerability was exposed because the application relied on the order of callbacks, which can be unpredictable.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Account takeover:** A successful CSRF attack could allow an attacker to modify user data (e.g. email address), effectively taking over the user's account.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **CSRF:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious form that would be submitted by a logged-in user without their knowledge.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs no special privileges but must be able to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted form or visiting a malicious website which would generate the forged request.
*   The application must be using `spree_auth_devise` with a vulnerable version and have `protect_from_forgery` configured with `:null_session` or `:reset_session` strategies in the `ApplicationController`.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present when using `:null_session` (default if not specified) or `:reset_session` strategies. The `:exception` strategy was not vulnerable.
*   The fix involves moving the `load_object` hook to a `before_action`, which ensures it is executed *after* the CSRF protection. This prevents the session from being wiped out before the user object is loaded, thus avoiding account takeover.
*   The provided commit includes a test case that specifically verifies that account takeover is not possible with the different forgery protection strategies.
*   The security advisory mentions that Rails default skeleton uses `:exception` strategy and is thus not vulnerable by default.
