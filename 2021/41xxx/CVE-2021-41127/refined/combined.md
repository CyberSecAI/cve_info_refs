# Maliciously Crafted Model Archive Can Lead To Arbitrary File Write

High

[rasa-jmac](/rasa-jmac)
published
GHSA-4365-fhm5-qcrx
Oct 21, 2021

## Package

pip

rasa
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<2.8.10

## Patched versions

2.8.10

## Description

### Impact

An Archive Extraction (Zip Slip) vulnerability in the functionality that allows a user to load a trained model archive in Rasa 2.8.9 and older allows an attacker arbitrary write capability within specific directories using a malicious crafted archive file.

### Patches

The vulnerability is fixed in Rasa 2.8.10

### Workarounds

Mitigating steps for vulnerable end users are to ensure that they do not upload untrusted model files, and restrict CLI or API endpoint access where a malicious actor could target a deployed Rasa instance.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Email the Rasa Security Team

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
