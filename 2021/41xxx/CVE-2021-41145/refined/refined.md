The provided content is related to CVE-2021-41145.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a memory exhaustion issue when FreeSWITCH is flooded with SIP messages. Specifically, large amounts of memory are allocated within the `su_home_new` function of the Sofia-SIP library, leading to the exhaustion of available memory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Memory exhaustion due to uncontrolled allocation within the Sofia-SIP library's `su_home_new` function when handling incoming SIP messages.
- Lack of proper resource management, leading to memory leaks, specifically in the Sofia-SIP library when handling SIP messages under a heavy load.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): An attacker can crash a FreeSWITCH instance by flooding it with SIP messages, rendering the service unavailable.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a large number of SIP messages to a FreeSWITCH server. The attack can be carried out over UDP, TCP or TLS. The SIP messages used include REGISTER, SUBSCRIBE, NOTIFY, PUBLISH, MESSAGE, INVITE, and OPTIONS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send SIP messages to the target FreeSWITCH server.
- No authentication is required to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker can be an external unauthenticated source.
