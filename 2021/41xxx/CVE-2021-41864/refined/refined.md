Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41864:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the Extended Berkeley Packet Filter (eBPF) subsystem in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the multiplication operation in the `prealloc_elems_and_freelist()` function, used to calculate the size of memory passed to `bpf_map_area_alloc()`, can result in an integer overflow due to the use of a 32-bit variable (`u32 elem_size`). This overflow leads to a smaller-than-expected size passed to the allocator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:**  The core issue is the potential for an integer overflow when calculating the size required for allocating eBPF stack map elements.
- **Out-of-bounds Write:**  The undersized memory allocation, due to the integer overflow, allows for an out-of-bounds write in the `pcpu_freelist_populate()` function which populates the freelist of per-cpu stack map elements

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Memory corruption or a system crash can occur due to the out-of-bounds write. This can lead to a denial of service.
- **Privilege Escalation:** There is the potential for privilege escalation, although the content doesn't fully detail the exact mechanism how this can be achieved, it is a possibility.
- **Memory Corruption:** The integer overflow and subsequent out-of-bounds write can corrupt kernel memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local User:** A local user can trigger the vulnerability. 
- **eBPF Subsystem:** Exploitation involves utilizing the eBPF subsystem and its stack map functionality, triggering the vulnerable calculation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local user with the ability to create and utilize eBPF programs to trigger the vulnerable code path. Unprivileged eBPF use may need to be enabled to trigger this vulnerability.
- The attacker must have the ability to craft eBPF programs that trigger the integer overflow in the memory allocation within `prealloc_elems_and_freelist()`.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability is mitigated by disabling eBPF use by unprivileged users by setting sysctl `kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1`. Also a patch was created that changes `elem_size` to a 64 bit integer (`u64`) to fix the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is present in Linux Kernel versions through 5.14.9
