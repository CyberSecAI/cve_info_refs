Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of input sanitization in the `InputFinalGrades.php` file. The `period` parameter from the HTTP request is directly used in a SQL query without proper filtering.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** SQL Injection. The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data exfiltration, modification, or deletion. Full database compromise is possible.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is the `period` parameter in the HTTP GET request to `/Modules.php?modname=users/TeacherPrograms.php?include=grades/InputFinalGrades.php`.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable code is located in `/opensis/modules/grades/InputFinalGrades.php` at line 55, where the `period` parameter is incorporated into the following SQL query:
```sql
SELECT cp.BEGIN_DATE,cp.MARKING_PERIOD_ID FROM course_periods cp,course_period_var cpv WHERE cpv.COURSE_PERIOD_ID=cp.COURSE_PERIOD_ID AND cpv.ID=2'6
```
The provided Proof of Concept (POC) request shows how an attacker can inject SQL by crafting the `period` parameter as `2'6`.

**Proposed Solution:**
The proposed solution, which has been implemented, is to sanitize the input using `sqlSecurityFilter()` before using the `period` parameter in the SQL query:
```php
$period = sqlSecurityFilter($_REQUEST['period']);
```

This filtering should prevent the injection of malicious SQL code by escaping special characters or removing SQL keywords.

The issue is marked as fixed in a later version of the software.
