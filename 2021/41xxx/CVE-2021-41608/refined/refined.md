Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-41608:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Broken Access Control in the `UploadedImageDisplay.aspx` endpoint of ClassApps Inc. SelectSurvey.NET v5.0. This endpoint allows retrieval of uploaded files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unauthenticated access to uploaded files. The application does not require authentication to access files through the `UploadedImageDisplay.aspx?ID=(x)` endpoint.
- Predictable file IDs: Files are stored in the database sequentially, allowing attackers to enumerate them by incrementing the ID parameter value.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthenticated attackers can access and download all uploaded files, including potentially sensitive documents like resumes, contracts, and spreadsheets.
- **Data Breach:** The exposure of user-submitted file attachments constitutes a data breach impacting the confidentiality of users' data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Requests:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable endpoint by crafting HTTP GET requests with incremental `ID` parameters.
- **Automated Tools:** Attackers can use tools like Burp Suite Intruder or simple scripting languages (e.g., Bash with `wget`) to automate the process of enumerating and downloading files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- No required authentication to the web application.
- No special privileges.
- Network access to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability allows for the retrieval of "over 300 uploaded survey user file attachments."
- The application had been previously patched for SQL injection vulnerabilities, but this broken access control issue remained.
- The Optiv article provides a detailed example of how an attacker would discover, validate, and exploit the vulnerability including details of using tools like Burp Suite and wget.
