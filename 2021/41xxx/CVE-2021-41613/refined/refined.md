Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41613:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incomplete implementation of the write logic for the Exception Effective Address Register (EEAR) in the mor1kx processor. Specifically, the hardware design lacks the necessary logic to allow writing to the EEAR using the `mtspr` instruction, even from supervisor mode.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Implementation:** The write logic for the EEAR register is not fully implemented, preventing modifications to the register.
*   **Violation of Specification:** The OpenRISC specification requires that the EEAR register should be accessible for writing from the supervisor mode, but the mor1kx implementation fails to provide this functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data or Control Flow Corruption:** Although the primary issue is the inability to write to EEAR, the impact is that exception handling routines that rely on writing to EEAR to store the address of the instruction causing the exception will be ineffective. This can lead to data corruption or unexpected behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by any code that executes an instruction which raises an exception, and if the exception handling routine attempts to write to the EEAR, the write will fail.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker doesn't necessarily need special privileges, as the issue is that even privileged code (supervisor mode) can't write to EEAR. The inability to write to EEAR is an issue within the system's operation itself and it could affect exception handlers.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

*   **Affected Component:** Privilege registers of the processor.
*   **Affected Product:** mor1kx processor.
*   **Location:** The issue is located in the `mor1kx_ctrl_cappuccino.v` file, specifically lines 830-840.
*   **Vendor Acknowledgment:** The vendor (openRISC) has confirmed and acknowledged the vulnerability.
*   **Detection Method:** The vulnerability was detected by a hardware fuzzer called TheHuzz, which compares the RTL design against a golden reference model.
*   **CWE Classification:** CWE-1201: Core and Compute Issues.
*   **Github Issue:** [https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx/issues/141](https://github.com/openrisc/mor1kx/issues/141)
