  "CVE-2021-41137": {
    "Description": "The vulnerability is due to a regression introduced in a previous fix. This regression caused policy restrictions to not be properly applied to regular users, allowing them to bypass intended access controls. This occurred because the checkKeyValid() function was not correctly identifying the owner of the credentials, particularly for non-service or STS accounts.",
    "Root cause": "A regression was introduced in the code that handles user permissions. The `checkKeyValid()` function, responsible for validating access keys, was not correctly determining ownership for regular users when they are not service or STS accounts. Specifically, the logic to set 'owner=true' was removed incorrectly for regular users who did not have a session policy, which was intended behavior for root credentials and sub-credentials.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect privilege assignment",
       "Inadequate access control checks"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability allowed regular users to bypass intended policy restrictions, potentially gaining unauthorized access to resources. Permissions and policies were effectively ignored for affected users.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through the normal S3 API by using valid access keys from a regular user.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker would need to have valid access keys for a regular user account within the MinIO system. No special network position or additional exploits are needed. The vulnerability was present on the server-side.",
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability was introduced by a change aimed at fixing a separate privilege issue with service accounts and session policies. A regression occurred when the code was refactored. The vulnerability was resolved by correcting the checkKeyValid() function to properly identify the owner of the credentials."
