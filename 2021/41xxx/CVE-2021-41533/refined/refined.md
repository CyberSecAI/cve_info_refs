Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41533:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read when parsing JT files within the affected applications. Specifically, the application reads past the end of an allocated buffer. This occurs due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data in the JT file parsing process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read:** The software reads data past the end of the allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to leak sensitive information from memory locations in the context of the current process.
- While the provided advisories focus on information disclosure, the ZDI advisory mentions that this vulnerability can be used "in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process."

**Attack Vectors:**
-  The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a malicious JT file.
- User interaction is required. The user must open a specially crafted malicious JT file using the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious JT file.
- The attacker must convince a user to open this malicious file. This can be achieved via social engineering, malicious websites, or other methods to deliver the file.
- The attack is local, as the malicious file needs to be opened on the target system.
