Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-41790:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the business logic surrounding script execution in Alfresco Content Services.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  Inadequate validation in the business logic of the script execution leading to potential privilege escalation.
- Specifically, the vulnerability stems from the way the application handles script execution within its sandboxed environment. Certain edge cases were not properly handled.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to an escalation of privileges within the sandboxed script execution environment. This implies that an attacker could potentially gain higher level access or execute commands with more permissions than initially intended.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector would involve manipulating script execution to trigger the specific edge cases the validation failed to handle.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  An attacker would need the ability to execute scripts within the Alfresco Content Services environment. This would likely require some level of access to the system.
- The attacker also needs to identify and exploit the specific edge cases in the script execution logic.
