Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause:**
- A file traversal vulnerability exists when handling SVG files in Nextcloud Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **File Traversal (CWE-23):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to access files outside the intended directory.
- **Unrestricted File Upload (CWE-434):** Although not explicitly stated, this is implied as the attacker can upload malicious SVG files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can download arbitrary SVG images from the host system, potentially including user-provided files.
- **Potential XSS/Phishing:** Attackers can upload malicious SVG files that mimic the Nextcloud login form and send specially crafted links to victims for phishing purposes. Note that the direct XSS risk is mitigated by Nextcloud's Content Security Policy.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially crafted links:** Attacker creates a link that, when opened, leverages the file traversal flaw to download arbitrary files or display malicious content.
- **Malicious SVG file upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to upload files or send links to Nextcloud users to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects Nextcloud Server versions prior to 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0.
- Patched versions include 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0
- A pull request ([https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/28726](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/28726)) was created to address the vulnerability.
- Gentoo also lists this CVE as part of a larger advisory, urging users to upgrade to Nextcloud version 23.0.4 or later.
