# ReDoS vulnerability in parser\_apache2

Moderate

[ashie](/ashie)
published
GHSA-hwhf-64mh-r662
Oct 29, 2021

## Package

bundler

fluentd
([RubyGems](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Arubygems))

## Affected versions

>= 0.14.14, <= 1.14.1

## Patched versions

1.14.2

## Description

### Impact

parser\_apache2 plugin in Fluentd v0.14.14 to v1.14.1 suffers from a regular expression denial of service (ReDoS) vulnerability. A broken apache log with a certain pattern of string can spend too much time in a regular expression, resulting in the potential for a DoS attack.

### Patches

v1.14.2

### Workarounds

Either of the following:

* Don't use parser\_apache2 for parsing logs which cannot guarantee generated by Apache.
* Put patched version of parser\_apache2.rb into /etc/fluent/plugin directory (or any other directories specified by the environment variable `FLUENT_PLUGIN` or `--plugin` option of fluentd).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
