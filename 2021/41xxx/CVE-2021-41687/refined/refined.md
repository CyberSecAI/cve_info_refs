Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41687:

**Summary:** The provided content indicates that CVE-2021-41687 is related to incorrect freeing of memory within the DCMTK library. This is further supported by the provided patch, which addresses potential null pointer dereferences and double frees.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability stems from improper memory management within the DCMTK library, specifically in the `dcmnet` component. The commit log message "Fixed poss. NULL pointer dereference/double free." and the Debian LTS advisory both point towards this.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Incorrect memory freeing:** The core issue is that memory is not being deallocated correctly, leading to potential double frees where the same memory is freed multiple times which can cause crashes.
*   **NULL pointer dereference:** The code might attempt to access memory through a null pointer, which occurs when a pointer doesn't point to a valid memory location. This could cause program termination or unexpected behavior.
*   The patch also fixes a potential memory leak related to a list of presentation contexts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service:** Exploiting this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by crashing the application.
*   **Possible memory corruption:** A double free can lead to memory corruption, which in turn might enable other attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is present within the `dcmnet` library, specifically when parsing and handling DICOM network messages related to association requests, presentation contexts, and user information.
*   An attacker could exploit this by sending malformed or crafted DICOM messages that trigger the faulty memory handling logic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send DICOM network messages to a vulnerable application.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the DICOM protocol to craft a malicious DICOM message that will trigger the bug.

**Additional Details from the Patches:**
* The patch includes changes to several files mainly in the `dcmnet` sub-directory, including `dulstruc.h`, `helpers.h`, `assoc.cc`, `dcuserid.cc`, `dul.cc`, `dulconst.cc`, `dulextra.cc`, `dulfsm.cc`, and `dulparse.cc`. This indicates that the vulnerability is spread across multiple parts of the `dcmnet` library.
*  The patch includes changes in functions responsible for creating, parsing and destroying presentation contexts and user information lists, indicating that these operations were the source of the bugs.
* The patch introduces new helper functions to destroy these lists, preventing memory leaks.
