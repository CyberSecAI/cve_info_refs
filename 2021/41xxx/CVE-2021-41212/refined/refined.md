Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41212:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a heap out-of-bounds read within the shape inference code of the `tf.ragged.cross` operation in TensorFlow. Specifically, when processing dense inputs, the code did not properly check input ranks and dimensions, leading to an out-of-bounds access of heap allocated array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read:** The core vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, where the shape inference logic attempts to access memory outside the allocated region for the input arrays when the shape or rank is not as expected. This occurs when `tf.ragged.cross` is called with dense inputs having ranks other than 2.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code lacks proper validation of input ranks before accessing memory, which enables the out-of-bounds read. The code expects rank 2 tensors for dense inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Triggering this vulnerability results in a read outside the allocated heap memory causing a program crash and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** By crafting a specific input to the `tf.ragged.cross` function, an attacker can trigger the out-of-bounds read. Specifically, providing inputs with rank other than 2.
- **TensorFlow API Usage:**  An attacker needs to be able to use the TensorFlow API to construct and pass the specially crafted input to `tf.ragged.cross` to cause the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to execute TensorFlow code or control the inputs to the `tf.ragged.cross` function. This could be achieved through:
   - A machine learning model that uses `tf.ragged.cross`.
   - A custom application that directly uses `tf.ragged.cross`.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of how the vulnerability can be triggered.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is in the shape inference part of `tf.ragged.cross` operation implementation.
- The fix adds rank and shape checks for dense inputs
- Patched versions: 2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
