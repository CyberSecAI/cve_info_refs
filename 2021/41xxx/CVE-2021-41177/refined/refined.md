Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41177:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of a database backend implementation for rate-limiting in Nextcloud server. This means that when a memory cache backend isn't configured, rate-limiting mechanisms, like those used by `AnonRateThrottle` or `UserRateThrottle`, are skipped entirely instead of using a fallback mechanism.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Fallback:** The primary weakness is the absence of a fallback database backend for rate-limiting. This results in rate-limiting being ineffective when a memory cache is not enabled.
- **Bypass of Rate Limits:** Rate limiting is completely bypassed when a memory cache isn't in use, exposing functions that relied on rate limiting like two factor code generation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Without rate-limiting, attackers could potentially overwhelm the server by making excessive requests.
- **Brute-force Attacks:** Specifically mentioned, an attacker could exploit the missing rate-limiting on two-factor authentication codes and potentially brute-force user accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Requests:** An attacker can send a high volume of requests to vulnerable endpoints that rely on the rate-limiting mechanisms.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Nextcloud server.
- **No Special Privileges:** No user account on the server or other special privileges are required to exploit this. The vulnerability occurs on functions like 2FA where rate limiting is used to prevent brute force attacks.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves implementing a database backend for rate-limiting that acts as a fallback when no memory cache is configured, and storing the period instead of the current timestamp in the backend.
- The vulnerability was present in Nextcloud Server versions before 20.0.13, 21.0.5, and 22.2.0.
- A workaround is to enable a memory cache backend like memcached or redis.
