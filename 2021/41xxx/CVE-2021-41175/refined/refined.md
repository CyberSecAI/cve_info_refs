Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41175:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when adding a client via the client groups management page. Specifically, the IP address and comment fields were not being escaped before being used in the web interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected through the "ip" and "comment" fields when adding a client. This malicious script is then stored in the system, and executed when the client information is displayed to other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they access the client management page.
- **Potential for Malicious Actions:** This could lead to various malicious actions, including but not limited to session hijacking, data theft, defacement of the web interface, or other attacks against users of the Pi-hole web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the Pi-hole web interface.
- **HTTP POST Request:** A malicious POST request is sent to the `groups.php` endpoint with crafted values for `ip` and `comment` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user with the ability to manage client groups.
- **Access to Web Interface:** The attacker needs to access the Pi-hole web interface.
- **Knowledge of HTTP Request:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a POST request, including the CSRF token and the malicious payload for the `ip` and `comment` fields.

**Additional details:**

The provided content includes the following:
*   A commit that fixes the vulnerability by using `utils.escapeHtml()` to sanitize user input in the `groups-clients.js` file and `htmlspecialchars()` in the `groups.php` file.
*   A security advisory that gives an example of the malicious request that triggers the vulnerability
*   A release note for version 5.8 indicating that the vulnerability was patched in this release.
