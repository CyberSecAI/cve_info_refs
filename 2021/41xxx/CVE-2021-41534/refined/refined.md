**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially leak sensitive information from the application's memory.
- This vulnerability may be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- The application might crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- A user must open a specially crafted malicious JT file with the vulnerable Siemens Solid Edge Viewer.
- The user must be tricked into opening the malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a malicious JT file that triggers the out-of-bounds read.
- The attacker needs to deliver the malicious file to a user of the vulnerable software.
- No special privileges are required, but user interaction is required to open the malicious file.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Siemens by the Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- Siemens released an update for NX 1980 Series, recommending users update to version V1984 or later.
- Siemens also released an update for Solid Edge, recommending users update to version SE2021MP8 or later.
