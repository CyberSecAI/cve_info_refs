The provided content is related to CVE-2021-41395.

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect validation of SSH host certificates by Teleport in specific code paths and the ability to manipulate database connection strings when connecting to Postgres databases. Additionally, there's a vulnerability in the Teleport build infrastructure that could potentially be used to alter build artifacts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **SSH Host Certificate Forging:** An attacker with a privileged network position could forge SSH host certificates, which Teleport would incorrectly validate. This impacts `tsh` usage with identity files (commonly used for service accounts), potentially leaking sensitive commands or allowing control of the SSH agent in proxy recording mode. Also, Teleport agents could incorrectly connect to an attacker-controlled cluster.
2.  **Database Connection String Manipulation:** When connecting to a Postgres database, an attacker could craft a database name or username to gain control over the resulting connection string. This could lead to probing connections to other reachable database servers and altering parameters like disabling TLS or connecting with password authentication.
3.  **Build Infrastructure Vulnerability:** A vulnerability in Teleport's build infrastructure could potentially allow for alteration of build artifacts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
1.  **Server Access:**
    - Leaking of sensitive commands executed by service accounts.
    - Control of the SSH agent when using proxy recording mode.
    - Teleport agents incorrectly connecting to malicious clusters (though this wouldn't directly grant access to resources).
2.  **Database Access:**
    - Ability to probe connections to reachable database servers.
    - Altering connection parameters, such as disabling TLS or using password authentication.
3.  **All:**
    - Potential for altered build artifacts impacting the integrity of Teleport installations.

**Attack Vectors:**
1. **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker with a privileged network position can intercept and manipulate network traffic to forge SSH host certificates.
2. **Malicious Database Connection String Manipulation:** An attacker crafts specific database names or usernames when connecting to Postgres to control the resulting connection string.
3. **Compromised Build Infrastructure:** The Teleport build infrastructure could be compromised to alter build artifacts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
1.  **Server Access:** Requires a privileged network position for MitM attacks.
2.  **Database Access:** Requires the ability to initiate connections to a Postgres database via Teleport, allowing manipulation of the connection parameters.
3.  **All:** Requires the ability to compromise the build infrastructure, which is an internal capability.
