Package        : tomcat8
Version        : 8.5.54-0+deb9u8
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-41079

Apache Tomcat did not properly validate incoming TLS packets. When Tomcat
was configured to use NIO+OpenSSL or NIO2+OpenSSL for TLS, a specially
crafted packet could be used to trigger an infinite loop resulting in a
denial of service.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
8.5.54-0+deb9u8.

We recommend that you upgrade your tomcat8 packages.

For the detailed security status of tomcat8 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/tomcat8>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
