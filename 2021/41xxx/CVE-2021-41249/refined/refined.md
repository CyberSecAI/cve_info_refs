{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `graphql-playground-react` component used `innerHTML` to render type names in HTML without proper escaping. Additionally, the component used two separate libraries to render Markdown, one of which (`marked`) recommended using a separate HTML sanitizer if its input is untrusted.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insecure handling of user-controlled input in GraphQL schema introspection responses or schema prop values.",
       "Use of unsafe `innerHTML` API to render type names.",
      "Use of `marked` library for Markdown rendering which requires additional sanitization for untrusted input."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the GraphQL Playground interface by providing a compromised GraphQL schema with malicious type names. This could lead to exfiltration of user credentials, data, or disruption of systems.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Compromised HTTP schema introspection responses.",
      "Malicious schema prop values.",
        "Specifying a URL to a malicious schema in the `endpoint` query parameter."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious GraphQL schema with specially crafted type names that include JavaScript code. An additional vulnerability is present when the endpoint URL can be overridden via query parameters, which allows for easier exploitation. The attacker must also induce a user to load the malicious schema in GraphQL Playground."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "defense_in_depth": "The fix implemented includes HTML escaping, schema validation, and using a single, up-to-date Markdown library (`markdown-it`).",
    "affected_components": "`graphql-playground-react` is the primary affected package, with potential impact on packages like `graphql-playground-html` and middleware packages using it.",
    "reproduction": "The provided link to `https://graphql-xss-schema.netlify.app/graphql` hosts a malicious schema to help reproduce the exploit. The exploit involves changing the endpoint in a GraphQL Playground installation to the malicious URL, and then typing '{x' in the operation pane, which will cause an alert."
