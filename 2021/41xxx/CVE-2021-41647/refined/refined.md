Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41647:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper sanitization of user input in the `username` parameter on the `/login.php` page of the Online-Food-Ordering-Web-App. This allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to both error-based and time-based blind SQL injection attacks due to the lack of input sanitization of the `username` parameter in the login page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Login Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the login authentication and gain full administrative access to the application.
*   **Data Exfiltration/Manipulation:** Through SQL injection, an attacker could potentially extract sensitive data from the database or manipulate the data stored within.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector involves sending an HTTP POST request to the `/login.php` page.
*   **`username` Parameter:** The `username` parameter is the injection point for SQL injection payloads.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Basic Understanding of SQL Injection:** The attacker needs to understand SQL injection techniques to craft malicious payloads.

**Technical Details:**
*   **Login Bypass Payload:** A simple payload like `user' or 1=1-- -` in the username input field can bypass the login.
*   **Error-Based SQL Injection Payload:**
    `username=test'||(SELECT 0x6d65686d WHERE 8694=8694 AND (SELECT 8639 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x71626a7a71,(SELECT (ELT(8639=8639,1))),0x71766a7171,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a))||'&password=asdfasdrf`
*   **Time-Based Blind SQL Injection Payload:**
    `username=test'||(SELECT 0x6d6d6367 WHERE 7580=7580 AND (SELECT 4416 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))nUhT))||'&password=asdfasdrf`
