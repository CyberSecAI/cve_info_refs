- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application lacks proper input sanitization/validation on user-controlled data within the `machineDetail` object, specifically when handling the `info` parameter within the `/main.js` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The application renders user-supplied input without proper encoding, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code to be injected and executed within the user's browser.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement of the web page, redirection to malicious websites, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious payload within the `info` parameter of the `updateMachineDetail` action.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the `/X/index.php` endpoint with the `updateMachineDetail` action and inject malicious JavaScript code into the `info` parameter. Specifically, the attacker needs to access the `machine_edit_component` which is protected by authentication, meaning the attacker needs to either be a legitimate user or gain access to a legitimate users session.
