| FlatPress 1.2.1 - Stored XSS in the Blog Content A stored Cross Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists in version 1.2.1 of the FlatPress application that allows for arbitrary execution of JavaScript commands. Steps to reproduce the vulnerability  1. Visit the FlatPress **Administration area**. 2. Navigate to the **Entries** -> **Write Entry**. 3. Enter any **Subject**. 4. In the content area put the following payload:    * `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>`   [1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32225978/133487288-cef4d410-d38a-4d49-a6de-85d1630e0587.png)   5. Click the **Save&Continue** button. 6. Stored XSS payload is triggered.   [2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/32225978/133487357-7fb9ae5d-c0b9-44e1-a9d7-b95bdfe6e502.png)   * Also we can verify the stored XSS payload by navigating to the home page.

| Hi, thanks for reporting this. As legitimated site admin, it is okay to add custom HTML or JS to your page - the described behaviour is intended. Does your findings implicate a way to exploit this behaviour *without* being logged in as site admin? Thanks and regards, Arvid |

| Adding JS to your entries is by design. Nothing to fix here until further notice. |
