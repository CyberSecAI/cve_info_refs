- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of the "X-Gradle-Enterprise-Ajax-Request" header in HTTP GET requests. When this header is present, the application bypasses access control checks, even though a 401 (Unauthorized) status code is returned. The response body of the requested resource is still included in the response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient access control enforcement leading to information disclosure. Specifically, the presence of the "X-Gradle-Enterprise-Ajax-Request" header bypasses authorization checks, and the application reveals protected information in the response body, despite returning an unauthorized status code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized viewing of build data and application configuration information. Attackers can gain access to sensitive data that they would normally not be able to view. This vulnerability does not allow for updating/changing of data, nor does it impact build cache or test distribution. Credentials for external systems are also not at risk.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending an HTTP GET request to the Gradle Enterprise application with the "X-Gradle-Enterprise-Ajax-Request" header.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the Gradle Enterprise application. They do not require any prior credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
