Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a bypass in the `set_user` extension for PostgreSQL, specifically related to how the `ProcessUtility_hook` was handled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `set_user` extension before version 3.0.0 allowed bypassing the `ProcessUtility_hook` using the `set_config()` function.
- This means that restrictions intended by `ProcessUtility_hook` were not enforced when the `set_config()` function was used.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful bypass of `ProcessUtility_hook` could lead to unauthorized modification of database settings or configurations.
- It is not clear from the context what exactly is set by the hook, but the bypass allows the circumvention of its intended purpose.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves using the `set_config()` function in PostgreSQL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to execute SQL queries, including the `set_config()` function, within the PostgreSQL environment.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix for this vulnerability in version 3.0.0 introduces an `object_access_hook` to block GUC (Grand Unified Configuration) modifications via `set_config()`. This new hook is intended to prevent the described bypass.
- The vulnerability is categorized as having a "Critical" severity, however the provided EPSS score is very low.

The provided information provides more detail than the basic description, specifying the vulnerability as a bypass of the `ProcessUtility_hook` via `set_config()` and describing the fix.
