# Remote Collector

## The Device42 Remote Collector[â](#the-device42-remote-collector "Direct link to The Device42 Remote Collector")

A Remote Collector (RC) is a virtual appliance deployed separately from the Device42 Main Appliance (MA). An RC is controlled from the MA and sent autodiscovery jobs that it executes remotely. All autodiscovery jobs, including Power SNMP jobs, are supported and can be run remotely on an RC.

note

Windows discovery requires at least one [Windows Discovery Service](/getstarted/installation/windows-discovery-service-installation/) (WDS) instance to be deployed.

You may configure an unlimited number of RC appliances as needed across your environment. RCs facilitate SNMP, IPMI, hypervisor, and other types of autodiscovery across networks requiring only HTTPS access, eliminating the need to open numerous ports across network segments.

### Sizing Recommendations[â](#sizing-recommendations "Direct link to Sizing Recommendations")

For one RC per 1000 workloads, the sizing recommendations are as follows:

* Two vCPU
* 4GB RAM
* 50GB vDisk

## Installation and Configuration[â](#installation-and-configuration "Direct link to Installation and Configuration")

To download the RC, head to our [**Autodiscovery** software download page](https://www.device42.com/autodiscovery/). In the **D42 Remote Collector (RC)** section at the top of the page, click the **Download** button.

We currently offer a `.ovf` image for direct download.

Should your hypervisor not support the OVF Virtual Machine (VM) image format, please contact support@device42.com and we will work with you to provide an image compatible with your hypervisor.

Deploy the VM image to your hypervisor, boot it, and use the following default credentials to log in via the VM console or SSH, Port 22.

Username:

```
client

```

Password:

```
device42

```

After logging in to the console, you will see the **Device42 Appliance Management Main Menu**.

![](/assets/images/D42-23170_RC-console-menu-3-18-06-DM-1ee31b30d4f2d1a9a662b5685bedc8d1.png)

### Initial (First-Boot) Network Configuration[â](#initial-first-boot-network-configuration "Direct link to Initial (First-Boot) Network Configuration")

Upon initial installation, configure your network settings to proceed with setup. It is best to use a static IP for your network, as Device42 can lose contact with RCs that have changing (dynamic) IP addresses.

On the **Main Menu**, choose **Network Interfaces** and press `enter` on the name of your interface to edit it. Use the `space bar` to unselect DHCP and assign a static IP address using the following screen:

![](/assets/images/D42-23170_RC-edit-network-interface-906c89ed74bc2364125372fe039177f9.png)

The **PREFIX** field above asks for an integer that represents the subnet mask in slash notation. For example, for the subnet mask `255.255.255.0`, which is `/24` in slash notation, you would enter `24`.

note

The **PREFIX** field has been removed, and as soon as your RC connects to Device42, it will be updated.

### Connect your Remote Collector to Device42[â](#connect-your-remote-collector-to-device42 "Direct link to Connect your Remote Collector to Device42")

Each RC must be able to communicate with the MA on Port 443. After initial communication, a WebSocket connection is established between the RC and the MA on a randomly selected ephemeral port, allowing full-duplex communication between them. The Device42 MA can thus talk to and control the RC over the WebSocket.

From the **Main Menu**, select **(r) Remote Collector Setup** to register your RC with your Device42 MA. To do this, you will first need to generate a one-time password (OTP) from Device42. Visit Device42 in your browser and via the main menu, head to **Discovery > Remote Collectors**. Here you will be able to view any existing registered RCs and generate an OTP to register a new one:

![RC menu location and OTP button](/assets/images/remote-collector-rc/menu-otp-light.png)![RC menu location and OTP button](/assets/images/remote-collector-rc/menu-otp-dark.png)

Click **Generate OTP** in the top right and copy the password you receive.

In the RC console, under **Remote Collector Setup**, enter your **OTP** and the IP address or FQDN of the **Host** MA.

![](/assets/images/D42-23170_RC-setup-OTP-18139a8cf6b8518886968657b3be85a3.png)

When the initial setup is complete, more detailed information about the configuration of the RC is visible under the **Remote Collector Setup** submenu, including the option to reset and reconfigure your RC.

![](/assets/images/D42-23170_RC-setup-before-reset-e71cac9e36ca35ae8a56c3015783845e.png)

After the initial registration on Port 443, all subsequent communication occurs over a secure WebSocket channel between the RC and the MA.

## View and Edit Remote Collectors[â](#view-and-edit-remote-collectors "Direct link to View and Edit Remote Collectors")

Open the Device42 website in your browser. Click the RC **Name** on the **Remote Collectors** list page to view or edit a specific RC. Click theÂ **Edit**Â button to edit the RC.

Note that the view and edit pages now include aÂ **MAC Address**Â field showing the address of the RC. Be careful editing this address; an incorrect address will cause the RC to disconnect.

![](/assets/images/D42-23170_RC-edit-page-83b3a9e73a3d36afabb81d651530c24b.png)

### Remote Collector List Page Actions[â](#remote-collector-list-page-actions "Direct link to Remote Collector List Page Actions")

Navigate to the **Remote Collectors** list page under **Discovery > Remote Collectors** and click **Select an action** to access the dropdown menu.

![Remote Collector list page actions](/assets/images/remote-collector-rc/actions-menu-light.png)![Remote Collector list page actions](/assets/images/remote-collector-rc/actions-menu-dark.png)

Select the relevant RC(s) from the table, choose one of the following actions, and click the **hammer icon** to execute the action:

* **Delete with Detailed Confirmation**: Delete the selected RC(s) with a confirmation prompt.
* **Export Selected Items as CSV**: Export a CSV file with information about the selected RC(s).
* **Clear logs**: Clear the log files for the selected RC(s).
* **Reboot Collectors**: Reboot the selected connected RC(s). Note that if your RC is exhibiting unusual behavior, rebooting the RC is a good first step to resolving the problem.
* **Set Logging Level**: Set the RC logging level. SelectÂ **Information**Â to reduce the log file size. You can also set a Global Logging Level via the RC console.

![Set logging level](/assets/images/remote-collector-rc/logging-level-light.png)![Set logging level](/assets/images/remote-collector-rc/logging-level-dark.png)

* **Set Proxy Settings**: Edit the RC(s) inherited proxy settings.

### Proxy Settings[â](#proxy-settings "Direct link to Proxy Settings")

The proxy settings within the MA and RC are set independently but are often identical. To reduce the potential for error, the RC can pick up preconfigured proxy settings. You can also view and edit the RC proxy settings within the RC view of the MA.

## Scalability[â](#scalability "Direct link to Scalability")

Device42 RCs provide robust scalability by offloading discovery workloads from your MA. You can deploy multiple RCs for each MA. We recommend using one RC with one WDS for every 1,000 workloads.

## Deployment Example[â](#deployment-example "Direct link to Deployment Example")

RCs are extremely flexible and make discovery with Device42 easier than ever. You can deploy one or more, with no logical limit to the number of RCs you can use.

![main menu](/assets/images/D42_RC_deploy_example-85b1cf3ba5e4c9e67a41d8a33acfbb38.png)

In the deployment example pictured above, an RC is deployed within each isolated DMZ network segment that, per firewall rules typical of a DMZ, the Device42 MA is normally unable to reach or discover directly. Deploying an RC to these segments bolsters security by saving the network administrator from making multiple temporary (or permanent and insecure) firewall rules (aka 'holes') to allow discovery traffic to pass from the MA over the wide range of ports used by various vendor APIs.

Please note that the diagram doesn't show the majority of network connectivity that would be present, and instead focuses on what is discovered by the MA and the RC, and the communication between them.

As mentioned briefly in the introduction, all communication and discovery information is securely transmitted between the RC and the MA once a connection is established via Port 443 (HTTPS/SSL). This means a single, secure, and easily monitored 1:1 rule allows for comprehensive and continuous discovery of the secured network segment - as often as scheduled or desired - without compromising its isolation or security.

## Running Remote Discoveries[â](#running-remote-discoveries "Direct link to Running Remote Discoveries")

Once registered, you can schedule any autodiscovery job from the MA and instruct it to run on the RC of your choosing. Each autodiscovery screen shows a **Remote Collector** dropdown menu. Click this dropdown to display all registered RCs and choose the RC you would like to run the discovery job:

![Add SNMP autodiscovery and select Remote Collector](/assets/images/Add-SNMP-autodisc-RC-v15-e55800daa666b5f3cb6aa0f2465aa1ad.PNG)

## Updating Your Remote Collector[â](#updating-your-remote-collector "Direct link to Updating Your Remote Collector")

Device42 RCs are updated automatically as long as they are connected to a Device42 MA. Updates to the MA instance include updates to your RC(s), which are pushed out automatically as part of the regular Device42 update process. By keeping your main Device42 instance up to date, you ensure that your RCs are also up to date.

## Migrating Existing Power Appliance Jobs to a Remote Collector[â](#migrating-existing-power-appliance-jobs-to-a-remote-collector "Direct link to Migrating Existing Power Appliance Jobs to a Remote Collector")

It is possible to use existing tools to migrate jobs that were created for the original, standalone power appliance to RCs.

Follow the [Power Job Migration Guide](/infrastructure-management/power-and-environmental-monitoring/power-rc-setup-job-migration/) to migrate jobs to your choice of RC(s).

# Nmap Autodiscovery

## Nmap Autodiscovery[â](#nmap-autodiscovery "Direct link to Nmap Autodiscovery")

Nmap (network mapper) is a tool primarily used for security scanning. However, it can be used to âguessâ which services are running on which ports. Device42 uses Nmap to discover which services are running on which ports and automatically combines this data with the [NetFlow](/auto-discovery/netflow-collector/) data to automatically create a map of services and application dependencies.

## Add a Nmap Autodiscovery Job[â](#add-a-nmap-autodiscovery-job "Direct link to Add a Nmap Autodiscovery Job")

Navigate to the **Discovery > Nmap** list page and click **Add Nmap autodiscovery spec** to create a new Nmap autodiscovery job.Â

Enter the following required fields for the Nmap job:

* **Name:** Unique name for the job
* **Remote Collector:** The Device42 ID for the remote collector to use for the job.
* **Target Host(s) and Network(s):**Â A comma-separated list of IP addresses, IP ranges, CIDR block(s), or hostname(s) to use for Nmap discovery.

![Nmap job required fields](/assets/images/nmap-autodiscovery/required-nmap-job-fields-light.png)![Nmap job required fields](/assets/images/nmap-autodiscovery/required-nmap-job-fields-dark.png)

You can optionally configure these Nmap job options:

* **Exclude Target Host(s) and Network(s):** A comma-separated list of IP addresses, IP ranges, CIDR block(s), or hostname(s) to exclude for Nmap discovery.
* **Nameserver to use for reverse DNS:** The IP address or FQDN of the nameserver.
* **OS Detection**: On by default. Detect operating systems and versions.
* **Service and Version Detection**: On by default. Detect running services.
* **Object Category for discovered devices:** Select an existing object category or add a new category.
* **VRF Group for discovered IP addresses and subnets:** Select an existing VRF group or add a new group.
* **Overwrite existing object categories:** Overwrite the object categories for existing discovered devices and child devices.
* **Tags for discovered devices:** Add a comma-separated list of device tags.

![Nmap job additional fields](/assets/images/nmap-autodiscovery/optional-nmap-fields-light.png)![Nmap job additional fields](/assets/images/nmap-autodiscovery/optional-nmap-fields-dark.png)
## Run Now or Schedule[â](#run-now-or-schedule "Direct link to Run Now or Schedule")

Select **Add another Auto Discovery Schedule** when creating or editing the job to add a schedule for the job.

![Add Nmap job schedule](/assets/images/nmap-autodiscovery/nmap-schedule-light.png)![Add Nmap job schedule](/assets/images/nmap-autodiscovery/nmap-schedule-dark.png)

Save the job to add it to the jobs list. Click **Run Now** from the list page to run the job right away.

![](/assets/images/D42-22946_nmap-ad-list-page-88ba3db914813c954b1626d42d028e60.jpg)

Note that newly created jobs will not run on the first day they are created to prevent an unintentionally large amount of jobs from initially running. If you would like to run a job after its initial creation, click the **Run Now** button next to the job after creation.

## Nmap and NetFlow Autodiscovery Notes[â](#nmap-and-netflow-autodiscovery-notes "Direct link to Nmap and NetFlow Autodiscovery Notes")

In Device42, NetFlow and Nmap can be used by themselves, together, or in combination with point-in-time discovery. Using NetFlow and Nmap data together but without point-in-time discovery results in a good services dependency mapping capability. However, just using these two sources of data is still limited in the following ways:

1. A map of service inter-dependencies and interrelationships can be created. However, many services often combine applications and associated information to form the entire application. For example, there might be multiple Oracle services plus configuration files that together form the Oracle application. Installed apps on a web server and instances and named pipes on a database cannot be discovered by the NetFlow/Nmap combination.
2. The services that Nmap finds are guesses and the guessed version number is probably wrong as often as it is right.
3. Some enterprises have such restrictive firewall rules that Nmap will discover few if any services.
4. NetFlow canât âseeâ application interactions inside a physical, virtual, or cloud server. NetFlow can only see interactions that go through the router. So, many dependencies will be missed.
5. While NetFlow works well for physical routers and switches, it's not great for the virtual routers and switches found in hyper-visors because many hyper-visors do not support NetFlow.
6. On routers and switches, NetFlow must be set up for every segment. If some segments are not set up, the application interactions will not be found.

To overcome these limitations, it is better to use NetFlow and Nmap in conjunction with point-in-time discovery.
