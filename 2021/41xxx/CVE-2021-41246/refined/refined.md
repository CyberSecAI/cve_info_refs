{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The express-openid-connect library, in versions 2.3.0 through 2.5.1, does not regenerate the session ID and session cookie upon user login, when a custom session store is used.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Session fixation vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can exploit this to potentially hijack user sessions if they can obtain a valid session ID before the user logs in.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker can obtain a session ID before a user logs in to a vulnerable application. After the user logs in, the attacker can use the original session ID to impersonate the victim."
