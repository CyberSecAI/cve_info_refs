Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41221:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation in the shape inference code for `Cudnn*` operations within TensorFlow. Specifically, the code doesn't check the ranks (number of dimensions) of the `input`, `input_h`, and `input_c` parameters. It assumes these inputs have specific ranks (at least 2 for `input`, and at least 3 for `input_h` and `input_c`), leading to out-of-bounds memory access when these assumptions are violated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap Buffer Overflow:** By providing inputs with incorrect ranks, the shape inference logic attempts to access memory locations beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer, resulting in a heap buffer overflow.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The core issue is the absence of proper rank validation on the input tensors. The code directly accesses dimensions based on assumed ranks without prior verification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Access to Invalid Memory:** Exploitation can lead to reading and potentially writing to arbitrary memory locations within the TensorFlow process. This can cause a crash, data corruption, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided example triggers a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Input Tensors:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by crafting specific input tensors with incorrect ranks for the `Cudnn*` operations.
*   **TensorFlow API:** The vulnerability is accessible through the TensorFlow API by constructing a computational graph with `Cudnn*` operations and providing malicious inputs. The provided code shows how to trigger this via the Python API using `tf.raw_ops.CudnnRNNV3`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to construct and execute TensorFlow graphs:** The attacker needs to be able to construct and execute TensorFlow graphs with crafted input tensors. They need access to the TensorFlow API and be able to influence the input data fed to the model.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `cudnn_rnn_ops.cc` file in the TensorFlow source code.
*   The fix involves adding rank checks for the input tensors in the shape inference functions to prevent out-of-bounds memory accesses.
*   The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.7.0. Patches were applied to versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2 and 2.6.1
