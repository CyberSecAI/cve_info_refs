Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-41105

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how FreeSWITCH handles Secure Real-time Transport Protocol (SRTP) packets. Specifically, when a media port processing SRTP traffic receives a flood of specially crafted SRTP packets, the software terminates the call instead of ignoring them.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Lack of Proper SRTP Error Handling:** FreeSWITCH has a hard-coded threshold for SRTP errors. When this threshold is reached, the call is terminated. The system does not have logic to handle a flood of invalid packets.
- **Vulnerable to DoS:** By sending a continuous stream of malformed packets, an attacker can force call disconnections, leading to a Denial-of-Service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Attackers can disrupt ongoing calls that use SRTP.
- **Call Termination:** Legitimate calls using SRTP are forcefully disconnected when the crafted packets are sent to the server.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attack can be performed without any form of authentication or prior access to the target network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based Attack:** An attacker can send malicious SRTP packets over the network to the FreeSWITCH server.
- **Targeted Packet Flooding:** The attacker sends a high volume of specially crafted SRTP packets to the media port handling the SRTP traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be able to send network packets to the FreeSWITCH server's public IP address and port ranges where the server is listening for media.
- **Basic Network Knowledge:** The attacker needs to have some understanding of network protocols and how to send packets to specific ports.
- **No Authentication:** The attacker does not require any credentials or prior access to the system. They can be external from the network.

**Additional Details:**
- **Vulnerable Versions:** FreeSWITCH versions up to and including 1.10.6 are vulnerable.
- **Fixed Version:** FreeSWITCH version 1.10.7 and later are not vulnerable.
- **Key Exchange Mechanisms:** The vulnerability can be exploited when using both SDES (in SIP) and DTLS (in WebRTC) key exchange mechanisms.
- **Exploit Code:** A sample Go program is provided that demonstrates how to send the crafted SRTP packets.
- **Fix Recommendation:** The suggested fix was to have FreeSWITCH ignore the invalid packets rather than terminate the calls.

The vulnerability is described as high severity, with a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5. The vulnerability can result in a denial-of-service condition but does not lead to any compromise in confidentiality or integrity.
