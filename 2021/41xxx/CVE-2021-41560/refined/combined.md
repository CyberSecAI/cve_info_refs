[@Nickguitar](https://github.com/Nickguitar) , [@RussH](https://github.com/RussH)

It doesn't work for me as expected.

With this change each uploaded files (even with extension from the whitelist) gets "txt" extension appended at the end of the filename

I'm currently applying such workaround for this commit

@Alt37 thank you - verified your findings and am applying your revision. Sorry - had verified the original fix caught 'bad' extensions, but hadn't checked it actually permitted 'good' extensions to pass!
