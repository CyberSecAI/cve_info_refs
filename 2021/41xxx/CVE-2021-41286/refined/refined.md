- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MultiCash application uses a client-side authentication mechanism where the password validity is checked locally, and all communication to the database uses the same technical account.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Client-Side Enforcement of Server-Side Security (CWE-602). The application does not properly validate credentials on the server-side, relying on client-side checks which can be manipulated.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can bypass authentication and gain administrative privileges over the application by manipulating the login function. This can lead to full control of the application and access to all its data and functionalities.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the machine running the MultiCash application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to attach a debugger to the MultiCash process or create a patch to manipulate the login function. They require the ability to modify the application's behavior on the client-side. The attacker doesn't need a valid password; they only need to manipulate the login process.
