# Segfault while copying constant resource tensor

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-786j-5qwq-r36x
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

During TensorFlow's Grappler optimizer phase, constant folding might attempt to deep copy a resource tensor. This results in a segfault, as these tensors are supposed to not change.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [7731e8dfbe4a56773be5dc94d631611211156659](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/7731e8dfbe4a56773be5dc94d631611211156659).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41204

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
