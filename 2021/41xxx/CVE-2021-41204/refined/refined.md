Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-41204.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the constant folding optimization within TensorFlow's Grappler optimizer, which attempts to deep copy resource tensors. These tensors are not designed to be copied and doing so results in a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness lies in the improper handling of `DT_RESOURCE` type tensors during constant folding. The optimizer was not designed to avoid deep copying these types, which causes a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a denial of service (DoS) via a segmentation fault, which will terminate the TensorFlow process.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered during the graph optimization phase of TensorFlow execution. The vulnerability can be triggered if a TensorFlow model contains resource tensors that are handled by the constant folding optimization.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to provide a TensorFlow model that would cause the constant folding optimization to attempt to deep copy a resource tensor. This doesn't require any special position and can be achieved through normal use of the library.
