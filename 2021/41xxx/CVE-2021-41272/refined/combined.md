# SHL, SHR, and SAR operations trigger native exception at key values

High

[shemnon](/shemnon)
published
GHSA-7pg2-p5vj-xp5h
Dec 10, 2021

## Package

org.hyperledger.besu:evm
(java)

## Affected versions

21.10.0,21.10.1

## Patched versions

21.10.2

## Description

### Impact

Changes in the implementation of the SHL, SHR, and SAR operations resulted in the introduction of a signed type coercion error in values that represent negative values for 32 bit signed integers. Smart contracts that ask for shifts between approximately 2 billion and 4 billion bits (nonsensical but valid values for the operation) will fail to execute and hence fail to validate.

* In networks where vulnerable versions are mining with other clients or non-vulnerable versions this will result in a fork and the relevant transactions will not be included in the fork.
* In networks where vulnerable versions are not mining (such as Rinkeby) no fork will result and the validator nodes will stop accepting blocks.
* In networks where only vulnerable versions are mining the relevant transaction will not be included in any blocks. When the network adds a non-vulnerable version the network will act as in the first case.

### Patches

Besu 21.10.2 fixes this (PR [#3039](https://github.com/hyperledger/besu/pull/3039)). Besu 21.7.4 is not vulnerable and clients can roll back to that version.

### Workarounds

Once a transaction with the relevant shift operations is included in the canonical chain the only remediation is to make sure all nodes are on non-vulnerable versions.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
