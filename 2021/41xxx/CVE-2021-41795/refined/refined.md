Specifically, Login and Password items (if matching the website's domain or not associated with any domain), Identity items, and Credit card items.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could gain access to sensitive information such as login credentials, personal identity information, and credit card details.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious JavaScript into a site that specifically targets the 1Password extension for Safari. This could be achieved through cross-site scripting attacks or by tricking a user into visiting a malicious website.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious javascript into a website that the victim visits. The 1Password application must be unlocked to be vulnerable.
