Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is a bug in the Telegram application's implementation of the auto-delete feature for media files on Android devices. While the chat window visually clears messages as intended, the corresponding media files (images) were not being deleted from the device's cache. This occurred specifically with the auto-delete feature and after multiple uses of the auto-delete timer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Inconsistent Data Deletion:** The primary vulnerability is the inconsistency between the visual deletion of messages in the chat and the actual deletion of media files from the device's storage. This leads to a false sense of security and violates the expected behavior of the auto-delete feature.
- **Data Residue in Cache:** Media files, which should be deleted according to the auto-delete settings, remain in the `/Storage/Emulated/0/Telegram/Telegram Image` directory. This creates a privacy vulnerability, as these files could be accessed by anyone with access to the device's file system.
- **Broken manual deletion:** The bug also extended to manual deletion, where visually deleted messages/files in the client application were not actually removed from the device cache, as initially intended.
- **Inconsistent auto-delete behavior:** The auto-delete feature would sometimes fail to delete cached files and would start working again after re-enabling the auto-delete feature after disabling it.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Privacy Breach:** The most significant impact is the potential privacy breach. Sensitive images shared in private or group chats, that users believe are deleted, could still be recovered from the device's cache.
- **Misleading Functionality:** Users are misled by the visual deletion of messages, believing that their media is also deleted when it is not.
- **Potential for Data Recovery:** Malicious actors or even regular users with access to the device could recover "deleted" media files.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Direct access to device's file system:** An attacker with physical or remote access to the device could navigate to the Telegram cache directory and recover media files that were intended to be deleted using auto-delete.
- **Exploiting the inconsistent behavior:** The inconsistent behavior of the auto-delete feature means that the vulnerability can be exploited without requiring special privileges or sophisticated tools by simply enabling auto-delete, sending/receiving images and then accessing the cache folder.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Access to device:** An attacker would need either physical access to the user's Android device or some form of remote access that allows them to browse the device's file system.
- **Basic file navigation knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of navigating the Android file system to locate the Telegram cache folder.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in Telegram for Android versions prior to the fix.
- The researcher reported the vulnerability to Telegram in March 2021 but encountered difficulties getting the issue addressed and a bounty awarded.
- The article mentions a similar bug that was previously assigned CVE-2019-16248
