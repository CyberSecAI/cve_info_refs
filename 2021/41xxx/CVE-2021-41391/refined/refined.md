- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input sanitization in the "Preference Definition" feature of the Ericsson ECM (Enterprise Content Management) solution. Specifically, the "label" field within the "User Profile Management" section allows the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Session hijacking, potentially leading to full account takeover.
    - Exploitation of admin's browsers using frameworks like BeEF.
    - Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected user's session.
- **Attack vectors:**
    -  A malicious script is inserted into the "label" field of a new or edited "Preference Definition" within the "User Profile Management" section.
    - When a user accesses the page displaying this preference, the stored script is executed in their browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be a logged-in user in ECM (no special privilege is mentioned).
    - The attacker needs access to the "User Profile Management" section of the application.
