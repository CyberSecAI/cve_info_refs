Dear Reader,

I was able to identify stored XSS in **Ericsson ECM (Enterprise Content Management) solution Version: 18.0 (0331) R1E**

**CVE ID: CVE-2021-41391**

Below are its details:

**# Software description:**Ericsson Catalog Manager allows customers to rapidly launch and enable new innovative offerings with simple user experience and enterprise product, service & resource catalog capabilities.
**# Technical Details & Impact:**
It was observed that **Security Management**Endpoint in **User Profile Management** Section is vulnerable to stored XSS, In most test cases session hijacking was also possible by utilizing the XSS vulnerability. This potentially allows for full account takeover, or exploiting admin's browsers using beef framework.
**# POC**

1. Login as normal user in ECM
2. Click on **User Profile Management** and click on **Preference Definition** or just visit this URL **"https://host:port/ecm/securityManagement "** change the host/port to your ECM host/port
3. Edit or create new Preference Definition
4. In Name field write anything, in label field write your malicious script. For test case we used only **alert('XSS')** as show below
