Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `saved_model_cli` tool in TensorFlow used the `eval` function to evaluate user-supplied strings passed via the `--input_exprs` argument.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Code Injection:**  Using `eval` on user-provided input allowed arbitrary Python code execution. This is because the `eval` function interprets the string as Python code and executes it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers could execute any Python code on the machine where `saved_model_cli` was run, potentially leading to data breaches, system compromise, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`--input_exprs` argument:** The vulnerability is triggered through the command-line argument `--input_exprs`, where users can supply strings that are then evaluated by the `eval` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute the `saved_model_cli` tool with the malicious `--input_exprs` argument. This implies that the attacker has access to the machine where the tool is used.

**Additional Information**

*   The fix involved replacing the usage of `eval` with `ast.literal_eval` which safely evaluates only literal expressions (and not arbitrary code) and adding a "safe" flag which defaults to True.
*   The vulnerability is considered "moderate" severity because it requires manual execution of the tool, reducing the likelihood of large-scale automated exploitation.
*   Patched versions include 2.4.4, 2.5.2, and 2.6.1. The fix will be included in version 2.7.0.
