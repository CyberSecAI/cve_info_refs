Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41490:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `LazyPRM.cpp` file of the OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library) v1.5.0. Memory was allocated within the `solve` method of the `LazyPRM` class (specifically at lines 368/343/324), but not consistently freed up. The `freeMemory()` function was not being called in the destructor of the class which was causing the memory leak.
- The issue arises because memory is allocated for states during the `solve()` method of the `LazyPRM` class. The memory should be released by the `freeMemory()` function. However, the program continues to allocate memory for states even after the last call to the `freeMemory()` function, leading to the leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Memory Leak:**  The core vulnerability is a memory leak due to improper memory management. Specifically, allocated memory for planner states within the `LazyPRM::solve` function was not being freed under certain conditions, particularly when the destructor was not properly releasing memory.
- **Improper Resource Management:** The issue highlights a failure to consistently release resources. The destructor of the `LazyPRM` class was not calling the `freeMemory()` function resulting in resource leakage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unexpected behavior:** Memory leaks can cause unexpected behavior, potentially leading to degraded performance.
- **Resource exhaustion:** If the memory leak is severe or prolonged, it could lead to resource exhaustion, potentially causing the program to crash or become unstable.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** In severe cases of resource exhaustion the program can crash leading to a DoS.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through normal usage of the vulnerable functionality within the OMPL library. An attacker would need to trigger the `LazyPRM::solve()` function.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker would need to utilize the OMPL library and call the `LazyPRM::solve` method in a way that exposes the memory leak. No special privileges are required.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability is addressed by modifying the destructor of the `LazyPRM` class to call `freeMemory()`.
- The vulnerability is present in OMPL version 1.5.0.
- The issue was reported and fixed as described in issue #833 in the ompl/ompl repository on GitHub.
- The vulnerability has a high severity rating with a CVSS score of 7.5 and a CVSS vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H
- The CWE associated with this vulnerability is CWE-401 (Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime).
