Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-41072:

**Root Cause:**

- The `unsquashfs` utility in squashfs-tools does not properly check for duplicate filenames within a directory during the extraction process of a Squashfs image.
- This flaw can be exploited by crafting a malicious Squashfs image that contains both a symbolic link and a regular file with the same name within the same directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows writing files outside of the intended destination directory.
- **Unvalidated Filenames:** The `unsquashfs` tool doesn't validate filenames, allowing an attacker to craft filepaths that point outside the extraction destination.
- **Duplicate Filenames:** Squashfs allows two files with the same name within a directory, leading to a vulnerability when unsquashfs attempts to create them.
- **Symlink following**: unsquashfs follows the symlink when creating the regular file with the same name as the symlink, leading to writing the file to the symlink target location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can overwrite arbitrary files on the filesystem where `unsquashfs` is executed.
- **Potential Code Execution:** By overwriting critical system files (e.g., `/etc/crontab`, `/etc/hostname`), an attacker can potentially achieve code execution on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malformed Squashfs Image:** An attacker crafts a malicious Squashfs image containing duplicate filenames and symbolic links.
- **Processing of Malicious Image:** When `unsquashfs` is used to extract the crafted Squashfs image, it writes files outside of the destination directory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious Squashfs image.
- The attacker needs to convince a user or system to process the malicious Squashfs image using `unsquashfs`.
-  For the most severe impacts, the unsquashfs process needs to run with sufficient permissions, usually root.

**Additional Details:**

-  The vulnerability was initially identified as a directory traversal issue using "..", but was later found to be exploitable using symlinks and duplicate filenames as well.
-  The fix involves checking for duplicate filenames within a directory during extraction and validating directory entries to ensure they are sorted.
- Patches were made to `unsquash-1.c`, `unsquash-2.c`, `unsquash-3.c`, `unsquash-4.c`, `unsquash-12.c`, `unsquash-1234.c` and `unsquashfs.h` to address this issue.
-  The vulnerability is addressed in squashfs-tools versions 4.5\_p20210914 and later.
