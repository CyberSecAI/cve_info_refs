Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41767:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from Apache Guacamole incorrectly including a private tunnel identifier in the non-private details of certain REST responses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper information exposure: The system exposes a private tunnel identifier in a context where it should not be revealed.
- Insufficient access control: The system fails to adequately protect the private identifier, allowing unauthorized access by users with permissions to use the same connection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An authenticated user, already authorized to access a specific connection, can potentially:
- Read data from another user's active session of that same connection.
- Interact with another user's active session of that same connection. This may involve interfering with their work, injecting commands, or disrupting the connection.

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited through REST API requests. An attacker leverages their existing access rights to a connection to gain information that should remain private to other users sharing that same connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user within the Apache Guacamole environment.
- The attacker must have permission to access a specific connection.
- The attacker must know the presence and availability of other users' active connections for the same target.
