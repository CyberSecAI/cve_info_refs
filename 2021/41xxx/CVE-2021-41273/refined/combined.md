# Cross-Site Request Forgery allowing sending of test emails and generation of node auto-deployment keys

Moderate

[DaneEveritt](/DaneEveritt)
published
GHSA-wwgq-9jhf-qgw6
Nov 17, 2021

## Package

pterodactyl
(php)

## Affected versions

< 1.6.5

## Patched versions

1.6.6

## Description

### Impact

Due to improperly configured CSRF protections on two routes, a malicious user could execute a CSRF-based attack against the following endpoints:

* Sending a test email.
* Generating a node auto-deployment token.

At no point would any data be exposed to the malicious user, this would simply trigger email spam to an administrative user, or generate a single auto-deployment token unexpectedly. This token is not revealed to the malicious user, it is simply created unexpectedly in the system.

### Patches

This has been addressed in [bf9cbe2](https://github.com/pterodactyl/panel/commit/bf9cbe2c6d5266c6914223e067c56175de7fc3a5) which will be released as `1.6.6`.

### Workarounds

Users may optionally manually apply the fixes released in v1.6.6 to patch their own systems.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
