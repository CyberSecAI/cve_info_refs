The provided content relates to CVE-2021-41198.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `tf.tile` operation when calculating the output tensor's size. The number of elements in the output tensor becomes too large to be represented by an `int64_t`, leading to an overflow and a subsequent `CHECK` failure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The core issue is the lack of proper bounds checking when calculating the size of the output tensor, which can lead to an integer overflow if the resulting size exceeds the capacity of the `int64_t` data type.
- Crash: Instead of throwing an exception the overflow triggers a `CHECK` statement that aborts the process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability can cause the TensorFlow process to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- By calling `tf.tile` with a large input argument for the number of tiles, an attacker can trigger the integer overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to call `tf.tile` with a carefully crafted input (a large number of tiles) to cause the overflow. This could be via a model that uses the `tf.tile` operation or through other code that directly invokes the `tf.tile` function.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reported externally via a GitHub issue.
- The fix involves adding a check to the `AddDimWithStatus` function in `tile_ops.cc` to prevent the integer overflow and prevent the process from aborting by returning an error.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity and affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.7.0, with patches backported to 2.4.4, 2.5.2, and 2.6.1.
