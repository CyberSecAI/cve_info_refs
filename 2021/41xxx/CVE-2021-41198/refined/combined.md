# Overflow/crash in `tf.tile` when tiling tensor is large

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-2p25-55c9-h58q
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

If `tf.tile` is called with a large input argument then the TensorFlow process will crash due to a `CHECK`-failure caused by an overflow.

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
tf.keras.backend.tile(x=np.ones((1,1,1)), n=[100000000,100000000, 100000000])
```

The number of elements in the output tensor is too much for the `int64_t` type and the overflow is detected via a `CHECK` statement. This aborts the process.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [9294094df6fea79271778eb7e7ae1bad8b5ef98f](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/9294094df6fea79271778eb7e7ae1bad8b5ef98f) (merging [#51138](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51138)).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported externally via a [GitHub issue](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46911).

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41198

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
