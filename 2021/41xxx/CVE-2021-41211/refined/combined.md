# Heap OOB in shape inference for `QuantizeV2`

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-cvgx-3v3q-m36c
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

The [shape inference code for `QuantizeV2`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/framework/common_shape_fns.cc#L2509-L2530) can trigger a read outside of bounds of heap allocated array:

```
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def test():
  data=tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2(
    input=[1.0,1.0],
    min_range=[1.0,10.0],
    max_range=[1.0,10.0],
    T=tf.qint32,
    mode='MIN_COMBINED',
    round_mode='HALF_TO_EVEN',
    narrow_range=False,
    axis=-100,
    ensure_minimum_range=10)
  return data

test()
```

This occurs whenever `axis` is a negative value less than `-1`. In this case, we are accessing data before the start of a heap buffer:

```
int axis = -1;
Status s = c->GetAttr("axis", &axis);
if (!s.ok() && s.code() != error::NOT_FOUND) {
  return s;
}
...
if (axis != -1) {
  ...
  TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(
      c->Merge(c->Dim(minmax, 0), c->Dim(input, axis), &depth));
}
```

The code allows `axis` to be an optional argument (`s` would contain an `error::NOT_FOUND` error code). Otherwise, it assumes that `axis` is a valid index into the dimensions of the `input` tensor. If `axis` is less than `-1` then this results in a heap OOB read.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a0d64445116c43cf46a5666bd4eee28e7a82f244](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a0d64445116c43cf46a5666bd4eee28e7a82f244).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, as this version is the only one that is also affected.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
