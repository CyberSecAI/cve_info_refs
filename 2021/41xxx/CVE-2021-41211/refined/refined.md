Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41211:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the shape inference code for the `QuantizeV2` TensorFlow operation. Specifically, the `axis` parameter, when set to a negative value less than -1, leads to accessing memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Out-of-Bounds Read:** The primary vulnerability is a heap-based out-of-bounds read. The code retrieves the `axis` attribute of a tensor and uses it as an index into the dimensions of the input tensor. If `axis` is less than -1, it reads data before the beginning of the allocated buffer.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the `axis` input, leading to the possibility of negative indices causing the OOB read. It handles the case where `axis` is not provided, but doesn't prevent invalid values if it's present.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially cause a crash or denial of service by triggering the out-of-bounds read. It might be possible to use this read to leak sensitive information from the heap.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `axis` parameter of the `QuantizeV2` TensorFlow operation.
- By crafting a specific TensorFlow program that calls `tf.raw_ops.QuantizeV2` with a negative `axis` value less than -1, an attacker can trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify TensorFlow graphs/code that uses the `QuantizeV2` operation.
- The attacker also needs to control the `axis` argument of the `QuantizeV2` operation.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `tensorflow/core/framework/common_shape_fns.cc` in the TensorFlow repository.
- The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions 2.6.0.
- The fix was introduced in commit `a0d64445116c43cf46a5666bd4eee28e7a82f244`, and will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0 and backported to 2.6.1.
- The fix adds a check to make sure `axis` is at least -1, returning an error message when the condition is not met.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
