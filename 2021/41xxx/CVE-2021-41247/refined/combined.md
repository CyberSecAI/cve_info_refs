# incomplete JupyterHub logout with simultaneous JupyterLab sessions

Moderate

[minrk](/minrk)
published
GHSA-cw7p-q79f-m2v7
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

jupyterhub
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

1.0.0 - 1.4.2

## Patched versions

1.5.0

jupyterhub
(helm)

<= 1.1.4

1.2.0

## Description

### Impact

Users of JupyterLab with JupyterHub who have multiple JupyterLab tabs open in the same browser session, may see incomplete logout from the single-user server, as fresh credentials (for the single-user server only, not the Hub) reinstated after logout, if another active JupyterLab session is open while the logout takes place.

### Patches

Upgrade to JupyterHub 1.5. For distributed deployments, it is jupyterhub in the *user* environment that needs patching. There are no patches necessary in the Hub environment.

### Workarounds

The only workaround is to make sure that only one JupyterLab tab is open when you log out.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41247

### Weaknesses

[CWE-613](/advisories?query=cwe%3A613)
