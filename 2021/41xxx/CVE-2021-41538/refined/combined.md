SSA-728618: Multiple Vulnerabilities in Solid Edge before SE2021MP8

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2021-09-28

SUMMARY

Siemens has released a new version for Solid Edge that ﬁxes multiple ﬁle parsing vulnerabilities which
could be triggered when the application reads ﬁles in IFC, JT or OBJ formats.

If a user is tricked to opening a malicious ﬁle using the affected application this could lead the application
to crash, or potentially arbitrary code execution on the target host system.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest version and to limit opening of ﬁles from unknown sources
in the affected products.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid opening ﬁles from unknown sources in Solid Edge

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Solid Edge is a portfolio of software tools that addresses various product development processes : 3D
design, simulation, manufacturing and design management.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-37202

The IFC adapter in affected application contains a use-after-free vulnerability that could be triggered
while parsing user-supplied IFC ﬁles. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in
the context of the current process.

SUMMARY

Siemens NX is affected by two vulnerabilities that could be triggered when the application reads OBJ
ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected application, this could lead to an access

## Siemens Solid Edge Viewer OBJ File Parsing Uninitialized Pointer Information Disclosure Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-1122ZDI-CAN-13770

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-41538](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-41538) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 3.3, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Solid Edge Viewer |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to disclose sensitive information on affected installations of Siemens Solid Edge Viewer. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of OBJ files. The issue results from the lack of proper initialization of a pointer prior to accessing it. An attacker can leverage this in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process. |
