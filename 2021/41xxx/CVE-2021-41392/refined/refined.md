The provided content relates to CVE-2021-41392.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `static/main-preload.js` file in BoostNote-App introduced a dangerous API, `openShellExternal`, which allowed arbitrary access on the unsafe renderer process. This was due to the lack of URL validation for the `openShellExternal` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsafe usage of the `openShellExternal` API which lacked proper URL filtering.
- Arbitrary command execution vulnerability in the renderer process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote command execution. An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary commands on a user's system by crafting malicious links.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious links in markdown previewer. An attacker could insert malicious links into a Boostnote document.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to introduce a malicious link into a markdown preview.
- User interaction with the malicious link is required for exploitation.
