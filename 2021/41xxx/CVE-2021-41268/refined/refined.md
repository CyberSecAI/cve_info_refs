  "cveId": "CVE-2021-41268",
  "description": "The 'Remember me' cookie in Symfony versions >=5.3.0 and <5.3.12 is not invalidated when a user changes their password. This allows attackers to maintain access to an account even after a password change, provided they obtained a valid 'remember me' cookie prior to the password update.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The remember me cookie signature did not include the user's password. Thus, changing the password didn't invalidate the cookie.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The remember-me cookie mechanism did not include the user's password in the cookie signature."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could maintain unauthorized access to an account even after a user's password change. An attacker who has obtained a valid remember-me cookie can continue to bypass authentication even if the user changes their password.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "An attacker obtains a valid remember-me cookie through a legitimate login.",
      "The user changes their password."
    ],
    "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to have had a valid login session at some point and obtained a remember-me cookie."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The fix includes the user's password in the cookie signature, so a password change invalidates the cookie.  The patch is available at https://github.com/symfony/symfony/commit/36a808b857cd3240244f4b224452fb1e70dc6dfc"
