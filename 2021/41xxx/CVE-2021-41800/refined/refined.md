  "CVE-2021-41800": {
    "description": "MediaWiki before 1.36.2 allows a denial of service (resource consumption because of lengthy query processing time). Visiting Special:Contributions can sometimes result in a long running SQL query because PoolCounter protection is mishandled.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a mishandling of PoolCounter protection in the Special:Contributions page. Specifically, the database query backing the page was executed outside the callback function given to PoolCounterWorkViaCallback, leading to a long-running SQL query in some cases.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS)",
       "Resource consumption",
        "Improper access restrictions"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to denial of service by causing a long-running SQL query, thus consuming resources and potentially making the affected page unavailable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "No special privileges or user interaction are needed to trigger this vulnerability. Any user visiting the Special:Contributions page could potentially trigger the long-running query.",
    "patch": "The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring that the call to getNumRows() (which triggers the database query) is made inside the callback function provided to PoolCounterWorkViaCallback.",
    "affected_versions": "< 1.36.2",
    "patched_versions": "1.36.2"
