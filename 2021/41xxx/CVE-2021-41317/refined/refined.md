Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41317:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an improper authentication implementation in XSS Hunter Express. Specifically, the application's route authentication logic was flawed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **CWE-287: Improper Authentication:** The core issue is that the authentication mechanism could be bypassed with a crafted request. The code was checking if a route was present in `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED_ROUTES` using `includes` method, but then it would check if request path started with any of the authenticated routes in that array. These checks are not the same and allow for bypass.
-   **Insufficient path checking:** The code uses `startsWith` for path matching against authenticated routes which can be bypassed by adding characters after a valid path, e.g. `/settings` would be authenticated, but `/settings/` would not.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could bypass authentication and potentially access sensitive information or perform unauthorized actions within the application. The provided data doesn't specify the full extent of the potential impact but implies a significant security risk.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Crafted HTTP Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted request that exploits the flawed route authentication. Specifically, a request to a protected path, like `/settings` with extra characters appended (e.g. `/settings/`), would not be considered an authenticated route as long as it didn't match any paths in the `AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED_ROUTES` array.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the XSS Hunter Express application. No other specific capabilities or position are mentioned.

**Additional Information:**
-   The vulnerability was fixed in commit `56bb44e` on September 17, 2021, by implementing better path checking.
-   The patch adds an extra check for `!requires_authentication` inside the `if(!AUTHENTICATION_REQUIRED_ROUTES.includes(req.path))`.
