| Code snippet ``` Server_start_rec_internal(Server *self, char *filename) {        .................        Server_debug(self, "Recording filename path = %s\n", filename);   ----> filename comes from external module, the length is indeterminate         if (! (self->recfile = sf_open(filename, SFM_WRITE, &self->recinfo)))         {             Server_error(self, "Not able to open output file %s.\n", filename);  ----> filename comes from external module, the length is indeterminate              Server_debug(self, "%s\n", sf_strerror(self->recfile));             return -1;         }         ................. }  Server_debug(Server *self, char * format, ...) {     if (self->verbosity & 8)     {         char buffer[256];         va_list args;         va_start (args, format);         vsprintf (buffer, format, args);    -----> Variable parameters may lead to write overflow in buffer         va_end (args);         PySys_WriteStdout("Pyo debug: %s", buffer);     } }  ``` Description **Function**: Server\_debug **File**: servermodule.c **Call-path**: recstart (Python) -> Server\_start\_rec -> Server\_start\_rec\_internal -> Server\_debug **WarningType**: Write-overflow. Our analysis tool reported a warning at vsprintf in Server\_debug. As buffer is a fixed size stack variable, when the debug mode is open, vsprintf may cause write overflow with no boundary check especially when the inputs depended on external modules (e.g., Python).
