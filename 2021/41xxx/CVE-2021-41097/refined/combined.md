# Prototype pollution

High

[bigopon](/bigopon)
published
GHSA-3c9c-2p65-qvwv
Sep 26, 2021

## Package

npm

aurelia-path
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 1.1.6

## Patched versions

1.1.7

## Description

### Impact

The vulnerability exposes Aurelia application that uses `aurelia-path` package to parse a string. The majority of this will be Aurelia applications that employ the `aurelia-router` package. An example is this could allow an attacker to change the prototype of base object class `Object` by tricking an application to parse the following URL: `https://aurelia.io/blog/?__proto__[asdf]=asdf`

### Patches

The problem should be patched in version `1.1.7`. Any version earlier than this is vulnerable.

### Workarounds

A partial work around is to free the Object prototype:

```
Object.freeze(Object.prototype)
```
### References

[#44](https://github.com/aurelia/path/issues/44)

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/aurelia/path/issues>

### Severity

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41097

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

| **I'm submitting a bug report**  parseQueryString of aurelia path is vulnerable to prototype pollution.  **POC** aurelia blog is using parseQueryString to parse location.search, so it is vulnerable to prototype pollution   1. Open the following URL: [https://aurelia.io/blog/?\_\_proto\_\_[asdf]=asdf](https://aurelia.io/blog/?__proto__%5Basdf%5D=asdf) 2. Open Devtools Console, and check the Object.prototype 3. You can notice Object being polluted with the "asdf" property. |

| Hi [@bigopon](https://github.com/bigopon) ,  Awesome, thanks. By the way, I read in GitHub docs you can request for CVE, can you please do that?  If you don't already have a CVE identification number for the security vulnerability in your project, you can request a CVE identification number from GitHub. GitHub usually reviews the request within 72 hours. Requesting a CVE identification number doesn't make your security advisory public. If your security advisory is eligible for a CVE, GitHub will reserve a CVE identification number for your advisory. We'll then publish the CVE details after you publish the security advisory.  More details are available here <https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/publishing-a-security-advisory>  Thanks and Regards, s1r1us |
