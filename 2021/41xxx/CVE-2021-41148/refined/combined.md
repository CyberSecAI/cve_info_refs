# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41148

| Summary \*The update of the CI job targeted by a widget is vulnerable to blind SQL injections |
| --- |

Original Submission

Tuleap does not sanitize properly user inputs when constructing the SQL query to update the continuous integration job targeted by one of the widgets.

### Impact

An attacker with the ability to add one the CI widget to its personal dashboard could execute arbitrary SQL queries.

CVSSv3.1 score: 8.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)

### Exploitation

Issue can be demonstrated by adding one the CI widget to a personal dashboard, edit it, set the value to submit to something like *(SELECT BENCHMARK(50000000,ENCODE('MSG','Slow')))* and submit. You will notice a unexpected slowness.
