# Introduction

The goal was to achieve remote code execution on a TP-LINK TL-WR840N EU (V5) router. According to its papers, this version came out in 2017.

![1](./cve-2021-41653/01.jpg)

TP-Link TL-WR840N EU v5

![2](./cve-2021-41653/02.png)
```

Model: TP-Link TL-WR840N EU v5
Note: There are newer hardware versions 6.0 and 6.20.
Vulnerable Firmware version: TL-WR840N(EU)_V5_171211 / 0.9.1 3.16 v0001.0 Build 171211 Rel.58800n

Authentication required: Yes
LAN exploit: Yes
POC: Yes
Reverse shell obtained: Yes
Patch is available: Yes

```

I highly recommend upgrading the firmware to the latest version "TL-WR840N(EU)\_V5\_211109". It can be downloaded from the vendor homepage.

I would like to say thank you to the TP-Link Security Team.

# Additional Notes:

I found a similar vulnerability on the TPLINK TL-WR840N v4 hardware, but it is different. It is related to the Traceroute function and telnet is available on that case.

The relevant CVE is the following:

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-15060>

There is another vulnerability on the TPLINK TL-WR840N v6 version that vulnerability is also an input validation problem, but it is not related to the diagnostic page.

More information can be found here:

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-36178>

I tested the vulnerability with a v6.20 device and it is not vulnerable.

# Technical Details

## Easy root via UART

I used my FT232 device to obtain root access to the device. This console was really useful during exploit development.

![3](./cve-2021-41653/03.png)
```

	# check serial port
	screen /dev/tty.usbserial-AB0LR7NH 115200

```
![4](./cve-2021-41653/04.png)

I used the UART console for debugging only and it is not necessary to exploit the vulnerability.

## The vulnerability

The following screenshot contains the relevant input parameter on the GUI. The user-provided input parameter is not sanitized on the server-side and it is used to execute a PING command.

Note: The WAN cable must be plugged in. The router IP Address is 192.168.1.1.

![5](./cve-2021-41653/05.png)

The vendor uses client-side JavaScript protection, but it can be bypassed easily with a proxy.

The protection:

![6](./cve-2021-41653/06.png)

The exact command is visible on the serial console when the command is executed.

![22](./cve-2021-41653/22.png)

Of course, I used ghidra and other reverse engineering tools to check
what is happening, but now it is enough the parameters are not sanitized on the server-side.

To execute code on the router, the following two requests must be sent:

Note:There are other requests, but they are not mandatory to achieve code execution.

Request 1 (the host parameter is vulnerable)

![7](./cve-2021-41653/07.png)

Request 2:

![8](./cve-2021-41653/08.png)
## Simple Code Execution

The following picture contains the content of the /var/tmp folder (via UART). This folder is writeable.

![9](./cve-2021-41653/09.png)

The host parameter modified to create a file:

Request 1:

![10](./cve-2021-41653/10.png)

Request 2:

![11](./cve-2021-41653/11.png)

The /var/tmp/k44 file content is the following:

![12](./cve-2021-41653/12.png)
## Reverse shell

The vendor provided programs are limited. For a successful attack multiple steps are necessary. The TFTP client can be used to copy files from the attacker to the router.

![13](./cve-2021-41653/13.png)

Note: The username and password are necessary.

1. Generate meterpreter shell (IP, PORT)
2. Prepare the TFTP server
3. Copy the shell to the TFTP server
4. Open Meterpreter listener
5. Send requests to the router
6. Download the shell via TFTP
7. Execute the binary and connect back to the attacker

The important part of the code execution does the following:

1. Upload the shell
2. Change permission of the shell
3. Execute the shell

![14](./cve-2021-41653/14.png)
## POC + DEMO

Notes:

1. I used my standard kali vm and the msfvenom tool to generate a reverse shell binary. The architecture is MIPSLE.
2. I used atfpd server as a TFTP server

Use multi handler:

![15](./cve-2021-41653/15.png)

Execute the script:

![15](./cve-2021-41653/16.png)

Reverse shell:

![17](./cve-2021-41653/17.png)

POC

```

# TP-Link Product Security Advisory

Protecting our customers from threats to their security is always an important task for TP-Link. As a key player in global Networking and Smart Home markets, we will do our utmost to provide our users with secure stable products and services, and to strictly protect the privacy and security of their data.

We welcome and encourage all reports related to product security or user privacy. We will follow established processes to address them and provide timely feedback.

## Report Vulnerabilities to TP-Link

We strongly encourage organizations and individuals to contact TP-Link’s security team to report any potential security issue.

| Contact way | |
| --- | --- |
| Email address | security@tp-link.com |
| Template | [Potential vulnerability report template](https://static.tp-link.com/document/excel/potential%20vulnerability%20report%20template%20v1.0.xlsx) |
| Hours | TP-Link will endeavor to respond to the report within five working days. |
| PGP Public Key | [Click to download](https://static.tp-link.com/upload/beta/2023/202312/20231214/PublicPGPKey.zip) |

TP-Link will need to obtain detailed information about the reported vulnerability to more accurately and quickly begin the verification process. We strongly recommend submitting a vulnerability report according to the template we provide above.

TP-Link supports encrypted messages using Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software.

## Responsible Reporting Guidelines

1. All parties to a vulnerability disclosure should comply with the laws of their country or region.

2. Vulnerability reports should be based on the latest released firmware, and preferably written in English.

3. Report vulnerabilities through the dedicated communication channel. TP-Link may receive reports from other channels but does not guarantee that the report will be acknowledged.

4. Adhere to data protection principles at all times and do not violate the privacy and data security of TP-Link's users, employees, agents, services or systems during the vulnerability discovery process.

5. Maintain communication and cooperation during the disclosure process and avoid disclosing information about the vulnerability prior to the negotiated disclosure date.

6. TP-Link is not currently operating a vulnerability bounty program.

## How TP-Link Deals with Vulnerabilities

* Awareness & Receipt
* ![](https://static.tp-link.com/handling-vulnerability-process-arrow.png)
* Verification
* ![](https://static.tp-link.com/handling-vulnerability-process-arrow.png)
* Remediation
* ![](https://static.tp-link.com/handling-vulnerability-process-arrow.png)
* Notification

TP-Link encourages customers, vendors, independent researchers, security organizations, etc. to proactively report any potential vulnerabilities to the security team. At the same time, TP-Link will proactively obtain information about vulnerabilities in TP-Link products from the community, vulnerability repositories and various security websites. In order to be aware of vulnerabilities as soon as they are discovered.

TP-Link will respond to vulnerability reports as soon as possible, usually within five business days.

TP-Link Security will work with the product team to perform a preliminary analysis and validation of the report to determine the validity, severity and impact of the vulnerability. We may contact you if we need more information about the reported vulnerability.

Once the vulnerability has been identified, we will develop and implement a remediation plan to provide a solution for all affected customers.

Remediation typically takes up to 90 days and in some cases may take longer.

You can keep up to date with our progress and the completion of any remediation activities.

TP-Link will issue a security advisory when one or more of the following conditions are met:

1. The severity of the vulnerability is rated CRITICAL by the TP-Link security team and TP-Link has completed the vulnerability response process and sufficient mitigation solutions are available to assist customers in eliminating all security risks.

2. If the vulnerability has been actively exploited and is likely to increase the security risk to TP-Link customers, or if the vulnerability is likely to increase public concern about the security of TP-Link products, TP-Link will expedite the release of a security bulletin about the vulnerability, which may or may not include a full firmware patch or emergency fix.
