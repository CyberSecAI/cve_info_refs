Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-41573

**Description:** Information Disclosure Vulnerability in Hitachi Content Platform Anywhere

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability arises from a flaw in how Hitachi Content Platform Anywhere (HCP-AW) handles shared links after the original files or folders have been deleted. Specifically, if a user created a link to a file or folder in a version prior to 4.4.5 and then the system is upgraded to 4.4.5 or higher, the link will still be active, even after the original file/folder was deleted and before the link expired.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The system does not properly invalidate or restrict access via shared links after the original resource is deleted, allowing access to other resources that should be restricted.
*   **Information Disclosure:** A malicious user with a valid, but stale, link to deleted content can browse and download all files of the authenticated user who originally created the link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access to Files:** Attackers can gain access to files and folders of other users that they should not be able to.
*   **Data Breach:** Sensitive information can be exposed to unauthorized parties.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network.
*   **Requires a Link:** An attacker needs a valid shared link that was created before the system was upgraded, and the content it pointed to must have been deleted after the upgrade.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Knowledge of a Valid Link:**  The attacker needs to possess a valid shared link to a file or folder that existed on the system before it was upgraded and was deleted after the upgrade. The link must have been created by a user on a system running version 4.3.x or earlier, and the system must now be running version 4.4.5 or 4.5.0.
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker must be able to communicate with the affected HCP-AW instance.

**Affected Systems:**
*   Hitachi Content Platform Anywhere (HCP-AW) versions 4.4.5 and later

**Mitigation:**
Upgrade to a patched version of Hitachi Content Platform Anywhere.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered by the combination of link creation in older versions, the subsequent upgrade of the platform to newer versions, and deletion of the original resource without deleting the link.
* The issue is due to how the system handles shared links after deletion of the original content.
