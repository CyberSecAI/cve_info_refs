      "is_related": true,
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The `FileController.php` in craft-seomatic plugin did not properly validate allowed file extensions, specifically not excluding SVG files which can be malicious.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper file extension validation",
           "Potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) or other attacks via malicious SVG files."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could upload or link to a malicious SVG file which, if accessed, could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the user's browser.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Uploading a malicious SVG file through the SEO File Link functionality.",
          "Crafting a URL that references a malicious SVG file via SEO File Link"

     "cve": "CVE-2021-41750",
     "is_related": true,
     "details": {
      "root_cause": "The fix for the vulnerability is implemented by explicitly disallowing SVG file extensions in the `FileController.php`",
      "weaknesses": [
       "Previous vulnerability was due to missing explicit block of SVG files"
      ],
      "impact": "The vulnerability is mitigated by not allowing SVG file extensions which are more susceptible to containing malicious code.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Attempting to load or link to an SVG file via the SEO File Link controller will now result in an error."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker is now unable to exploit the vulnerability by loading an SVG file via SEO File Link"
