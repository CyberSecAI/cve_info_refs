{
  "cve": "CVE-2021-41229",
  "description": "Multiple NetApp products incorporate BlueZ. BlueZ version 5.58 is susceptible to a vulnerability which when successfully exploited could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).",
  "affected_products": [
    "None"
  ],
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `sdp_cstate_alloc_buf` function in BlueZ allocates memory which will always be hung in the singly linked list of cstates and will not be freed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS). An attacker can cause the service of the target device to crash by continuously sending sdp packets leading to resource exhaustion.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by continuously sending SDP packets to the vulnerable service.",
     "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send SDP packets to the vulnerable service. This suggests a network proximity or the ability to send packets to the target device, but no authentication or user interaction is required."
