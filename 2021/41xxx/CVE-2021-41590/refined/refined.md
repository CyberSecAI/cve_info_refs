Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41590:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the SMTP server settings test function in the Gradle Enterprise administrative user interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The SMTP configuration test function can be abused to probe the server-side network environment.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   By using the test function, an attacker can identify the listening TCP ports that are accessible to the server.
*   This reveals information about the internal network environment, which can be leveraged for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the administrative user interface, specifically the SMTP server settings test function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have access to the administrative interface of Gradle Enterprise.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability allows an attacker with access to the Gradle Enterprise admin interface to probe the server's network by testing arbitrary SMTP server configurations. This can expose information about the internal network environment by revealing listening TCP ports.
