Based on the provided information, this content relates to CVE-2021-41149.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `tough` library did not properly sanitize target names when caching a repository or saving specific targets to an output directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper sanitization of target names, specifically not handling path traversal characters in target names.
- Allows writing files to arbitrary locations

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Files could be overwritten with arbitrary content anywhere on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting malicious target names within the TUF repository metadata.
- During caching or saving of the targets, unsanitized target names could lead to writing files outside of the intended directories.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the content of a TUF repository, which could mean being a malicious maintainer of the repo or having compromised the maintainers keys.
