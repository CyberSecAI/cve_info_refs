Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified SQL injection vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerability 1**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `GetStuListFnc.php` file. Specifically, the `Grade` parameter from the request is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper filtering.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL commands into the application's database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or denial of service.
*  **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted POST request to `/Modules.php?modname=students/AdvancedReport.php&modfunc=&search_modfunc=list&next_modname=students/AdvancedReport.php` with a malicious SQL payload in the `grade` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Vulnerability 2**

*   **Root Cause:** Insufficient input sanitization in `EditHistoryMarkingPeriods.php`. The `values[new][MP_TYPE]` parameter is vulnerable.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection.
*   **Impact:** Similar to the first vulnerability, attackers can execute malicious SQL queries.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to `/Modules.php?modname=grades/EditHistoryMarkingPeriods.php&modfunc=update&tab_id=&mp_id=` with a malicious payload in the `values[new][MP_TYPE]` parameter.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Vulnerability 3**

*   **Root Cause:** Lack of sanitization in `EntryTimes.php`, specifically the `values[STAR'T_DAY]` parameter.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection.
*  **Impact:** Allows attackers to inject SQL commands into the database.
*   **Attack Vector:** By crafting a POST request to `/Modules.php?modname=eligibility/EntryTimes.php` with malicious SQL code in the `values[STAR'T_DAY]` parameter.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.

**Mitigation:**
The provided content suggests using the `sqlSecurityFilter()` function before using user-supplied parameters in SQL queries. This function would sanitize the input to prevent SQL injection attacks. The fix for all three vulnerabilities is to use `sqlSecurityFilter()` on the vulnerable input parameters.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was initially reported on September 22, 2021, and was addressed in a subsequent release.
*   The vulnerable application is openSIS-Classic version 8.0, with MySQL or MariaDB as the database.
*  The provided content also contains code snippets demonstrating how to reproduce the vulnerabilities and how to fix them.
