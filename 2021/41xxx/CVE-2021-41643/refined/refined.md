```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not check for an authenticated user session when accessing the 'classes/Users.php' file and saving user details. This allows an unauthenticated user to upload a malicious PHP file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unauthenticated File Upload",
    "Remote Code Execution (RCE)",
    "Inadequate access control",
  "Insufficient input validation on file uploads"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the hosting webserver by uploading a maliciously crafted PHP file that bypasses the image upload filters, allowing them to execute arbitrary commands on the server.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable 'classes/Users.php' file, with the 'f' parameter set to 'save', and a malicious PHP file uploaded as an image.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can execute this attack remotely. They need to craft a malicious PHP file and send a specific POST request to the vulnerable endpoint."
