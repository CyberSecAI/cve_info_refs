Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41535:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error that occurs while parsing OBJ files. The application does not properly validate the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free (CWE-416): The software attempts to use memory after it has been freed, leading to potential corruption or unexpected behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could potentially execute code within the context of the current process. This could lead to complete compromise of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- File parsing: The vulnerability is triggered when the application processes a specially crafted OBJ file.
- User interaction: Exploitation requires the user to open a malicious OBJ file using the affected application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to deliver a malicious OBJ file to the target user.
- The attacker has no specific privilege requirements, but the user must interact with the malicious file to trigger the vulnerability

**Affected Products:**
- Siemens Solid Edge Viewer
- Siemens NX

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is identified as ZDI-CAN-13771 by the Zero Day Initiative.
- Siemens released updates to address this vulnerability in Solid Edge (SE2021MP8 or later) and NX (V1973.3700 or later for NX 1953 series, V1988 or later for NX 1980 series).
- Siemens advises users to avoid opening files from untrusted sources as a mitigation.
