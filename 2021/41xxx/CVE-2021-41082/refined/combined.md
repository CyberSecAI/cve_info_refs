This partially reverts commit [ddb4583](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/commit/ddb458343dc39a7a8c99467dcd809b444514fe2c).

Seeing performance degrade on larger sites so back to drawing board on
this one. Instead of the DISTINCT LEFT JOIN, we switch back to
IN(subquery).

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

PERF: Improve query performance all inbox private messages. ([#14304](https://github.com/discourse/discourse/pull/14304))

```
First reported in <https://meta.discourse.org/t/-/202482/19>

There are two optimizations being applied here:

1. Fetch a user's group ids in a seperate query instead of including it
   as a sub-query. When I tried a subquery, the query plan becomes very
inefficient.

1. Join against the `topic_allowed_users` and `topic_allowed_groups`
   table instead of doing an IN against a subquery where we UNION the
`topic_id`s from the two tables. From my profiling, this enables PG to
do a backwards index scan on the `index_topics_on_timestamps_private`
index.

This commit fixes a bug where listing all messages was incorrectly
excluding topics if a topic has been archived by a group even if the
user did not belong to the group.

This commit also fixes another bug where dismissing private messages
selectively was subjected to the default limit of 30.

# Group private messages title and participating users are leaked to users that do not have access.

High

[tgxworld](/tgxworld)
published
GHSA-vm3x-w6jm-j9vv
Sep 20, 2021

## Package

Discourse
(Discourse)

## Affected versions

tests-passed = ddb4583

## Patched versions

tests-passed > 27bad28

## Description

### Impact

This affects Discourse instances running against the `tests-passed` branch and deployed between 15 September 2021 02:44 AM UTC to 15 September 2021 05:16 AM UTC.

Any private message that includes a group had its title and participating user exposed to users that do not have access to the private messages. However, access control for the private messages was not compromised as users were not able to view the posts in the leaked private message despite seeing it in their inbox.

### Patches

The problematic commit was reverted around 32 minutes after it was made. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest commit if they are running Discourse against the `tests-passed` branch.

### Severity

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
