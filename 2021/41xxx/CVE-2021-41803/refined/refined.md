{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Missing input validation in Consul's auto-config feature when processing JSON Web Tokens (JWTs) in auto-config requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Authenticated denial of service"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can craft a malicious auto-config request to generate TLS certificates and ACL tokens for node names not intended by the operator. This forces the Consul server to store unintended information, which can then be repeatedly abused to cause a denial-of-service attack.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious actor sends a specially crafted auto-config request with a modified node name through the auto-config mechanism using a JSON web token.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft and send an auto-config request. The attacker would need to be an authenticated operator capable of sending such requests."
