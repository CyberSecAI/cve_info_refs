Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-41672

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries in the `utilisateurs.php` file. Specifically, the `id_utilisateur` POST parameter is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper escaping or the use of prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, which allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the database query through the `id_utilisateur` parameter.
- **Lack of Prepared Statements:** The absence of prepared statements or parameterized queries makes the application susceptible to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the database. This includes user credentials, personal details, and other confidential data.
- **Data Modification:** Besides reading, the attacker can modify data within the database, potentially leading to data corruption or further compromise.
- **Application Logic Manipulation:** Through SQL injection, an attacker can manipulate the application's logic, allowing them to execute arbitrary database commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is via a malicious POST request to the `/peel-shopping_9_4_0/administrer/utilisateurs.php` endpoint.
- **`id_utilisateur` Parameter:** The payload is injected via the `id_utilisateur` POST parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with some administrative privileges to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP POST requests with a malicious payload in the `id_utilisateur` parameter.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The content from github.com_0d1d4317_20250115_182206.html provides a clear description of the vulnerability, along with links to proof-of-concept screenshots.
- The content from github.com_c41fe897_20250115_182207.html confirms the vulnerability with CVE and GHSA IDs and provides a CVSS score with a severity level of "Moderate". It specifies the attack vector as Network and Privileges required as High.
- The content from github.com_0d1d4317_20250115_182206.html also mentions that multiple PHP files are affected by the same issue, implying a systemic weakness in the application's SQL handling.
- The content from github.com_c41fe897_20250115_182207.html identifies CWE-89 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command) as the weakness.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is an authenticated SQL injection in the PEEL Shopping CMS, specifically within the `utilisateurs.php` file. The `id_utilisateur` POST parameter is not properly handled, allowing attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code, leading to data breaches and data manipulation. The lack of prepared statements in the application is highlighted as the root cause with multiple PHP files affected by the same issue.
