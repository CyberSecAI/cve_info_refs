The provided content relates to CVE-2021-41276.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Tuleap application does not properly sanitize the search filter built from the `ldap_id` attribute of a user during the daily LDAP synchronization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- LDAP Injection: The application is vulnerable to LDAP injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided input (`ldap_id` attribute) when constructing LDAP queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Account suspension: A malicious user could manipulate the `ldap_id` attribute to force the suspension of other user accounts.
- Account takeover: By injecting malicious code into the `ldap_id`, a user could potentially take over another account by forcing the update of the `ldap_uid` attribute.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to have network access to the Tuleap instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have either site administrator privileges on the Tuleap instance or be an LDAP operator with the capability to create/modify accounts.
- The Tuleap instance needs to have the LDAP plugin activated and enabled for this vulnerability to be exploitable.
