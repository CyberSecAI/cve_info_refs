* + The actual transfer speed of USB 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and/or Type-C will vary depending on many factors including the processing speed of the host device, file attributes and other factors related to system configuration and your operating environment.
  + Actual data throughput and WiFi coverage will vary from network conditions and environmental factors, including the volume of network traffic, building material and construction, and network overhead, result in lower actual data throughput and wireless coverage.
  + Quoted network speeds and bandwidth based on current IEEE 802.11ac specifications. Actual performance may be affected by network and service provider factors, interface type, and other conditions. Connected devices must be 802.11ac-compatible for best results.
  + WPA/WPA2 enterprise is only available on single router, is not available under AiMesh mode.
  + When traditional QoS is enabled, there will be limitations due to the actual Internet service bandwidth and different environment, and there may be a risk of speed reduction.
  + Due to the different power supply requirements on USB external hard disk and 4G/5G Modem device, to ensure that the external device can be used stably, if the USB external device exceeds the standard USB 2.0 (5V/500mA) and USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5V/900mA) power supply requirements, you need to use it with an independent external power supply.

* All specifications are subject to change without notice. Please check with your supplier for exact offers. Products may not be available in all markets.
* Specifications and features vary by model, and all images are illustrative. Please refer to specification pages for full details.
* PCB color and bundled software versions are subject to change without notice.
* Brand and product names mentioned are trademarks of their respective companies.
* The terms HDMI and HDMI High-Definition Multimedia Interface, HDMI trade dress and the HDMI Logos are trademarks or registered trademarks of HDMI Licensing Administrator, Inc. in the United States and other countries.

* + The actual transfer speed of USB 3.0, 3.1, 3.2, and/or Type-C will vary depending on many factors including the processing speed of the host device, file attributes and other factors related to system configuration and your operating environment.
  + Actual data throughput and WiFi coverage will vary from network conditions and environmental factors, including the volume of network traffic, building material and construction, and network overhead, result in lower actual data throughput and wireless coverage.
  + Quoted network speeds and bandwidth based on current IEEE 802.11ac/802.11ax specifications. Actual performance may be affected by network and service provider factors, interface type, and other conditions. Connected devices must be 802.11ac/802.11ax compatible for best results.
  + WPA/WPA2 enterprise is only available on single router, is not available under AiMesh mode.
  + When traditional QoS is enabled, there will be limitations due to the actual Internet service bandwidth and different environment, and there may be a risk of speed reduction.
  + Due to the different power supply requirements on USB external hard disk and 4G/5G Modem device, to ensure that the external device can be used stably, if the USB external device exceeds the standard USB 2.0 (5V/500mA) and USB 3.1 Gen 1 (5V/900mA) power supply requirements, you need to use it with an independent external power supply.
  + If you use the product in conjunction with a third party service, you are responsible for complying with the third party provider's terms and conditions and privacy policy and are also at the risk of such use.
