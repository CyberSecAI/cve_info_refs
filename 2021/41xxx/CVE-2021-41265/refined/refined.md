Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-41265

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper authentication within the REST API of Flask-AppBuilder. Specifically, the API login logic failed to properly validate authentication requests when using non-database authentication providers (like LDAP), and also for newly created REST API endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Authentication (CWE-287):** The core issue is that the authentication process for non-database authentication types in the REST API was flawed, allowing attackers to bypass it.
- The vulnerability is present specifically in the API login logic. It also affects new REST API endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows a malicious actor to bypass authentication, gaining unauthorized access to protected REST API endpoints. This can lead to a wide range of impacts, including data breaches, unauthorized modification of resources, and potential disruption of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests to the REST API's login endpoint.
- The attacker needs to send requests with specific parameters to exploit the authentication bypass.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Flask-AppBuilder instance's API.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP POST requests with specific parameters to target the API's login endpoint.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability only affects non-database authentication types (like LDAP) and new REST API endpoints.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.3.4 of Flask-AppBuilder.
- The commit `eba517aab121afa3f3f2edb011ec6bc4efd61fbc` includes changes related to schema validation and introduces a fix to `flask_appbuilder/security/api.py` and `flask_appbuilder/security/schemas.py` . The schema validation appears to be the main focus of the fix for the login API endpoint.
- The security advisory GHSA-m3rf-7m4w-r66q corresponds to this CVE.
