Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   Lack of input validation for the `EID`, `EN_tyid`, and `theID` parameters when editing events or event types. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries into the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is susceptible to SQL injection due to the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input before being used in database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database.
*   This can lead to the extraction of sensitive information, modification of data, or potentially gaining full control of the database server, depending on the database user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending malicious SQL code via POST requests in the following parameters:
    *   `EID` parameter in `EventEditor.php`
    *   `EN_tyid` parameter in `EditEventTypes.php`
    *  `theID` parameter in `EventNames.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable functionality within the ChurchCRM application.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs the ability to craft or modify HTTP requests to inject malicious SQL code in the vulnerable parameters.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited using techniques like boolean-based blind SQL injection and time-based blind SQL injection.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates the use of `sqlmap` to exploit the `EN_tyid` parameter, which successfully lists the available databases.
*   The vulnerability was reported to the vendor on 2021-09-16, but there was no response.
*   The affected versions are ChurchCRM 2.0.0 to 4.4.5.
