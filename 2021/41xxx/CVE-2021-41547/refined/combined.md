PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Teamcenter Active Workspace is a web application for accessing the Teamcenter system that provides
an identical and seamless experience on any computer or smart device.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-41547

The application contains an unsafe unzipping pattern that could lead to a zip path traversal attack.
This could allow and attacker to execute a remote shell with admin rights.
