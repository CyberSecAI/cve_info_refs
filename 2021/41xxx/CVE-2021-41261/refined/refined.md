Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41261:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input in multiple areas of the Galette application. Specifically, the `pref_footer` preference, the `Entitled` labels, `Title` labels and `Transaction` descriptions were not being sanitized before being stored in the database and displayed to users.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the application that are then executed in the browsers of other users.
- Lack of input sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the application.
- This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- The attacker could also perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying data or redirecting the user to a malicious site.
- Requires administrator rights to inject.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker would need to have admin rights.
- The attack would involve injecting malicious scripts via the following fields:
  - `pref_footer` preference in the application's settings.
  - `Entitled` labels.
  - `Title` labels.
  - `Transaction` descriptions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker must have administrative privileges within the Galette application.

**Additional details:**

The provided commit `0d55bc7` addresses the vulnerability by:
- Adding the `ezyang/htmlpurifier` library to sanitize HTML input.
- Using the HTML purifier to sanitize the `pref_footer` preference before storing it.
- Stripping HTML tags from the `Entitled` labels, `Title` labels and `Transaction` descriptions before storage.
- Adding escaping to various templates to ensure that user supplied values are not rendered as code, but rather displayed as text in the UI.

This commit also adds the library to composer.json and composer.lock, and updates copyright notices.
