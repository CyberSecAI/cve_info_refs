- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure deserialization of Java objects from client-side cookies. The application session data is stored as client-side cookies after being encrypted and signed with installation-specific keys.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure deserialization vulnerability. An attacker with the encryption and signing keys can craft a malicious HTTP request to deserialize unsafe objects.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Maliciously crafted HTTP request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must obtain the encryption and signing keys used by Gradle Enterprise.
