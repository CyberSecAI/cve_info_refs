{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input when creating header names, header values, status reason phrases, URI paths, or URI authority registered names.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of user-controlled input",
      "HTTP Response Splitting vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious data into HTTP response headers, allowing them to control the remaining headers and body of the response, and create additional responses, leading to Cross-User Defacement, Cache Poisoning, Cross-site Scripting (XSS) and Page Hijacking attacks.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Injecting CR (carriage return, %0d or \\r) and LF (line feed, %0a or \\n) characters into headers through untrusted user input."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request containing CR and LF characters to the vulnerable server."
    ,
    "additional_details": "This vulnerability exists in various implementations of `org:http4s::http4s-server` and `org:http4s::http4s-client`. The following backends render invalid carriage return, newline, or null characters in an unsafe fashion: blaze-server, ember-server, blaze-client, and ember-client. The vulnerability was fixed by sanitizing header values by replacing null, carriage return, and newline with space characters, and dropping header names, status reason phrases, URI paths, or URI registered names if invalid.  The fix also involves raising an IllegalArgumentException if a URI path or registered name is invalid."
