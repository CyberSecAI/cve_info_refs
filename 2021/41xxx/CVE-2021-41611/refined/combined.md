Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-15d2f70a07
2021-10-29 22:48:33.390217
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : squid
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 5.2
Release : 1.fc35
URL : <http://www.squid-cache.org>
Summary : The Squid proxy caching server
Description :
Squid is a high-performance proxy caching server for Web clients,
supporting FTP, gopher, and HTTP data objects. Unlike traditional
caching software, Squid handles all requests in a single,
non-blocking, I/O-driven process. Squid keeps meta data and especially
hot objects cached in RAM, caches DNS lookups, supports non-blocking
DNS lookups, and implements negative caching of failed requests.

Squid consists of a main server program squid, a Domain Name System
lookup program (dnsserver), a program for retrieving FTP data
(ftpget), and some management and client tools.

Subject: CVE-2021-44273: e2guardian did not validate TLS hostnames

Hello!

Some time ago I was trying to make a certain Arch Linux system compliant
with CyberEssentials security requirements from the UK [1], and this
includes the requirement for anti-virus scanning of all web browser
traffic. I interpreted this literally: break TLS using MITM on the
(transparent) proxy, scan everything with ClamAV. Note: I may be
mis-interpreting and over-complying, there is an unverified opinion that
anti-malware browser extensions are enough and that it is not needed to
break TLS. I don't know.

Anyway, I have decided to try e2guardian 5.4.3r and later a 5.5 git
snapshot, in the standalone mode (where it functions as a transparent
proxy, as opposed to an ICAP server), because of the apparent simplicity of
its setup. While testing it, I found that it significantly lowered the
security of the system it purported to protect: I was able to access,
through this transparent proxy, a significant amount of badssl.com
subdomains that should not be accessible.

In particular, I was able to access wrong.host.badssl.com, which meant that
SSL certificate hostname validation was not working, and an attacker could
trivially MITM the connection from the origin server to e2guardian. I have
reported this [2], and it is now fixed in the v5.4 branch [3]. There is
still no formal release with the fix.

I do not see anything relevant on the v5.5dev branch, though, and I have
not tested any other branches. The issue exists only if e2guardian is
compiled against OpenSSL 1.1.x, and is operating in the standalone mode.
Builds using OpenSSL 1.0.2 or operating as ICAP servers (as opposed to
standalone transparent proxies) are not affected.

This issue with missing TLS hostname validation is now known as
CVE-2021-44273. Distribution package maintainers, please see if your
e2guardian package is vulnerable.

I have also reported [4] another issue, that certain badssl.com subdomains
that implement bad crypto (dh2048, dh-small-subgroup, dh-composite,
tls-v1-0, tls-v1-1), normally rejected by browsers, are still accessible
through the e2guardian transparent proxy. However, we have agreed that it
is not a bug in e2guardian, but just insecure OpenSSL defaults (and no
user-oriented documentation how to change them via openssl.cnf), because
the same subdomains can be accessed via curl. Interestingly, Squid (with
ssl-bump enabled) does disallow such bad crypto.

In my personal opinion (which may be different from the official opinion of
any company that I work or worked for), the incident described above, plus
a similar recent incident with Squid (CVE-2021-41611), should be treated as
an evidence that such "please MITM all SSL traffic" requirements actually
lower the security and should be abandoned, merely because browsers
de-facto have the best available quality of TLS implementations.

# SQUID-2021:6 Improper Certificate Validation of TLS server certificates

High

[yadij](/yadij)
published
GHSA-47m4-g3mv-9q5r
Oct 4, 2021

## Package

squid
(Squid)

## Affected versions

5.0.6-5.1

## Patched versions

5.2

## Description

When validating an origin server or peer certificate, Squid may

incorrectly classify certain certificates as trusted.

---

### Severity:

This problem allows a remote server to obtain security trust

when the trust is not valid. This indication of trust may be

passed along to clients allowing access to unsafe or hijacked

services.

This problem is guaranteed to occur when multiple CA have

signed the TLS server certificate. It may also occur in cases

of broken server certificate chains.

CVSS Score of 8.4

---

### Updated Packages:

#### This bug is fixed by Squid version 5.2.

In addition, patches addressing this problem for the stable

releases can be found in our patch archives:

#### Squid 5:

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Versions/v5/SQUID-2021_6.patch>

If you are using a prepackaged version of Squid then please

refer to the package vendor for availability information on

updated packages.

---

### Determining if your version is vulnerable:

All Squid-4 and older are not vulnerable.

All Squid-5.0.1 up to and including 5.0.5 are not vulnerable.

All Squid-5.0.6 up to and including 5.1 are vulnerable.

---

### Workaround:

The only workaround is complete denial to TLS and HTTPS servers

publishing affected certificate chains. The set of affected

servers varies over time and is left out of this document.

acl vulnerableDomains dstdomain .example.net

http\_access deny vulnerableDomains

### Contact details for the Squid project:

For installation / upgrade support on binary packaged versions

of Squid: Your first point of contact should be your binary

package vendor.

If you install and build Squid from the original Squid sources

then the squid-users@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list is

your primary support point. For subscription details see

<http://www.squid-cache.org/Support/mailing-lists.html>.

For reporting of non-security bugs in the latest STABLE release

the squid bugzilla database should be used

<https://bugs.squid-cache.org/>.

For reporting of security sensitive bugs send an email to the

squid-bugs@lists.squid-cache.org mailing list. It's a closed

list (though anyone can post) and security related bug reports

are treated in confidence until the impact has been established.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
