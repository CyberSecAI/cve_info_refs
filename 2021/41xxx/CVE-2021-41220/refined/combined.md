# Use after free / memory leak in `CollectiveReduceV2`

High

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-gpfh-jvf9-7wg5
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

The [async implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/kernels/collective_ops.cc#L604-L615) of `CollectiveReduceV2` suffers from a memory leak and a use after free:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.CollectiveReduceV2(
  input=[],
  group_size=[-10, -10, -10],
  group_key=[-10, -10],
  instance_key=[-10],
  ordering_token=[],
  merge_op='Mul',
  final_op='Div')
```

This occurs due to the asynchronous computation and the fact that objects that have been `std::move()`d from are still accessed:

```
auto done_with_cleanup = [col_params, done = std::move(done)]() {
  done();
  col_params->Unref();
};
OP_REQUIRES_OK_ASYNC(c,
                     FillCollectiveParams(col_params, REDUCTION_COLLECTIVE,
                                          /*group_size*/ c->input(1),
                                          /*group_key*/ c->input(2),
                                          /*instance_key*/ c->input(3)),
                     done);
```

Here, `done` is already moved from by the time `OP_REQUIRES_OK_ASYNC` macro needs to invoke it in case of errors. In this case, we get an undefined behavior, which can manifest via crashes, `std::bad_alloc` throws or just memory leaks.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [ca38dab9d3ee66c5de06f11af9a4b1200da5ef75](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/ca38dab9d3ee66c5de06f11af9a4b1200da5ef75).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, as this version is the only one that is also affected.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.
