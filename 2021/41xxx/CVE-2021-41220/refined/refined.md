Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-41220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a use-after-free and memory leak in the asynchronous implementation of `CollectiveReduceV2` in TensorFlow. This occurs because the `done` callback is moved from using `std::move()`, but it is still accessed later. Specifically, the `OP_REQUIRES_OK_ASYNC` macro might try to invoke the moved-from `done` in case of errors leading to undefined behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: Accessing memory that has been deallocated or moved, which leads to undefined behavior.
- Memory leak: Failure to release allocated memory which can lead to memory exhaustion.
- Incorrect handling of asynchronous operations: The asynchronous operation uses `std::move()` on a callback which is subsequently used again.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Exploitation can lead to:
- Crashes
- `std::bad_alloc` exceptions.
- Memory leaks
- Undefined behavior due to accessing freed memory.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `CollectiveReduceV2` operation in TensorFlow with specific parameters which are listed in the Description section. The operation is exposed through the `tf.raw_ops.CollectiveReduceV2` call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to execute TensorFlow code, using the vulnerable function (`CollectiveReduceV2`) with the listed parameters or causing error within the `OP_REQUIRES_OK_ASYNC` macro.
- No special privileges are needed beyond the ability to run TensorFlow code.
