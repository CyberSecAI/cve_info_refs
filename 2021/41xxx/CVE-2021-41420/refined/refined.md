Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-41420 (though the description is a placeholder and needs to be updated).

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization within the Maian Affiliate v.1.0 application. Specifically, when adding a new product via the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Code Execution:** The provided text mentions "code execution" vulnerability, this might indicate that the application could be vulnerable to command injection or similar issues that could allow execution of arbitrary code. More context is required to confirm the specifics.
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability detailed is a stored XSS. When an admin adds a new product, a malicious payload can be injected into a field (likely the product name or description). This injected script is then stored in the database and reflected back to users on the affiliate main page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution (Potential):** If code execution is possible, an attacker can gain full control over the server or the application itself. This allows for data theft, complete system compromise, or other malicious activities.
*   **Stored XSS:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of users who visit the affiliate page. This allows an attacker to:
    *   Steal user session cookies, potentially gaining access to their accounts.
    *   Redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   Deface the website.
    *   Perform other actions on behalf of the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Admin Panel:** The attack vector is through the authenticated admin panel of the Maian Affiliate application.
*   **Product Creation:** The vulnerability is triggered when a new product is added, and a malicious payload is entered in one of the product information fields.
*   **Affiliate Main Page:** The injected payload is reflected on the affiliate main page which is visible to both authenticated and unauthenticated users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Access:** The attacker needs to have valid administrative login credentials to access the Maian Affiliate admin panel.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Field:** The attacker needs to know which field is vulnerable to XSS, specifically where the payload needs to be inserted during the product creation process.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information focuses on Maian Affiliate v.1.0. There's no information about other versions.
*   The Github repo provides a demonstration of the stored XSS vulnerability, including a GIF showing the exploit.

In summary, Maian Affiliate v.1.0 has a stored XSS vulnerability that allows an attacker with admin access to inject malicious scripts, potentially compromising the application and its users. There is also a mention of a potential code execution vulnerability, but the exact details need to be confirmed.
