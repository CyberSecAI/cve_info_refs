| Code snippet ``` Server_jack_init(Server *self) {     int i = 0;     char client_name[32];  -----------> No initialization     char name[16];      .........     strncpy(client_name, self->serverName, 31);  -------------> when length of self->serverName is 31,  client_name may has no terminator. It is a risk of read-overflow.      ......... }  ``` Description **Function**: Server\_jack\_init **File**: ad\_jack.c **Call-path**: boot (Python) -> Server\_boot -> Server\_jack\_init **WarningType**: read-overflow. Our analysis tool reported a warning at the call-site of strncpy. As client\_name is not initialized, it may has no terminator after strncpy hence to cases read-overflow.
