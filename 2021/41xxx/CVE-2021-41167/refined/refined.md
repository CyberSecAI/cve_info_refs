Based on the provided information, this content is related to CVE-2021-41167.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `forEachLimit` and `forEachSeries` functions in the `modern-async` library did not correctly limit the concurrency of actions, which means that the functions did not respect the specified concurrency limits and would execute all the asynchronous operations concurrently, rather than the intended limited concurrent execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing `await` keyword in the implementation of `forEachLimit` function. Specifically, the `iteratee` function (which represents an async action) was not being awaited in the `mapLimit` function call, causing the concurrency limit to be effectively ignored.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The lack of concurrency control could lead to potential security issues in applications using this library. For example, if the functions were used to perform database writes or make external API calls, an excessive number of concurrent operations could overwhelm the server, resulting in denial of service or other performance issues. The reporter specifically mentions "security issue for servers to handle too many requests at the same time".

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered by calling the vulnerable functions `forEachLimit` or `forEachSeries` with an iterable and an async function as iteratee, with the assumption that the specified concurrency limit will be respected. Any code that calls these functions expecting a certain degree of concurrency control is vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker does not need special capabilities or position; they only need to invoke the vulnerable function `forEachLimit` or `forEachSeries` of the affected library. An attacker can exploit this by calling the vulnerable function in a way that creates more concurrent operations than expected, leading to a resource exhaustion of the target application that uses the `modern-async` library.

The provided content gives more detail than the official CVE description by explaining the root cause of the issue, the exact code change needed to fix the issue (adding `await` before calling the iteratee function), and providing a practical example of how the vulnerability manifests.
