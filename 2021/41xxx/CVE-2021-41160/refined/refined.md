Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-41160:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper region checks within the FreeRDP client when handling graphics updates sent by the server. Specifically, a malicious server can send graphics update commands with zero width/height or out-of-bounds rectangles.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The lack of proper bounds checks when processing the width and height of the region to be updated leads to an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. When the width or height is zero, memory allocation might be zero, however, the code doesn't prevent writes to the pointer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
A malicious RDP server can exploit this vulnerability to cause an out-of-bounds write on the client. This can lead to crashes, denial-of-service, or potentially arbitrary code execution on the client machine.

**Attack vectors:**
A malicious RDP server sends crafted graphics updates with zero or out of bound width/height values during a connection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to control or be acting as the RDP server that the vulnerable FreeRDP client connects to.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all FreeRDP clients.
- The fix is included in FreeRDP version 2.4.1.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when the client uses GDI or SurfaceCommands to receive graphics updates.
- This issue is also mentioned in the context of the freerdp2 package in Debian LTS advisory DLA-3654-1.
