Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect permission setting in the `DiskLruImageCacheFileProvider` of the Nextcloud Android application. The provider was using `android:readPermission` instead of `android:permission`, which allowed read access to files without requiring the intended `MANAGE_DOCUMENTS` permission.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Permission:** The primary weakness is the use of `readPermission` which grants read access without enforcing the stricter `MANAGE_DOCUMENTS` permission.
- **Permission Bypass:** This allows an attacker to bypass the intended permission check, potentially accessing sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially access cached thumbnail files which may contain sensitive data, even without having the `MANAGE_DOCUMENTS` permission. The likelihood of sensitive data being present in thumbnails is considered low.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious application could exploit this vulnerability by directly accessing the content provided by `DiskLruImageCacheFileProvider`, bypassing the intended permission requirements.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the user's device.
- **No Special Permissions:** The attacker doesn't require any special permissions except for the standard permissions to install and run an application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involved changing `android:readPermission` to `android:permission` within the `AndroidManifest.xml` file.
- The vulnerability was identified by an analyst (@atorralba) and reported through HackerOne.
- The issue is tracked as GHSL-2021-1008.
- This vulnerability is specific to Nextcloud Android application versions prior to 3.17.1.
