# Permission bypass in DiskLruImageCacheFileProvider (GHSL-2021-1008)

Low

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-wrwg-jwpg-r3c4
Jan 26, 2022

## Package

Android
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 3.17.1

## Patched versions

3.17.1

## Description

### Impact

This issue may lead to sensitive information disclosure, in the case a thumbnail contains sensitive data (although the chances are low), even if the attacker app does not have the otherwise required `MANAGE_DOCUMENTS` permission.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Android App is upgraded to 3.17.1.

### Workarounds

None.
