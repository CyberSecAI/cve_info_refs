  "CVE-2021-41184": {
    "Description": "jQuery-UI is the official jQuery user interface library. Prior to version 1.13.0, accepting the value of the `of` option of the `.position()` util from untrusted sources may execute untrusted code. The issue is fixed in jQuery UI 1.13.0. Any string value passed to the `of` option is now treated as a CSS selector. A workaround is to not accept the value of the `of` option from untrusted sources.",
    "Root cause": "The `of` option of the `.position()` utility in jQuery-UI was not properly sanitizing input, allowing it to be interpreted as HTML rather than a CSS selector.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Input Handling"
    ],
    "Impact": "Execution of arbitrary Javascript code within the application by an attacker, potentially leading to information disclosure, session hijacking or other malicious activities.",
    "Attack vectors": "By supplying a malicious string to the `of` option of the `.position()` utility.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be able to control the input to the `of` option of the `.position()` function. This can occur if the input is derived from an untrusted source, such as user input or data from a remote server."
