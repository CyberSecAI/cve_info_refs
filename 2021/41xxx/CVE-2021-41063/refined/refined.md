Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the CVE-2021-41063 vulnerability:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2021-41063, confirming it's relevant.

**2. Root Cause:**

The root cause is an **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements used in an SQL Command ('SQL Injection')** vulnerability (CWE-89). This means the application fails to properly sanitize user inputs when constructing SQL queries, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input validation or sanitization, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This allows an attacker to insert arbitrary SQL commands into the application's queries.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Manipulation:** Successful exploitation could allow an unauthenticated attacker to manipulate the Aanderaa GeoView database server. This includes potentially reading sensitive data, modifying data, or even deleting data.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** The attack is considered to have low complexity.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need authentication to exploit the vulnerability

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the affected Aanderaa GeoView instance.
