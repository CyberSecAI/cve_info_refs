# Groupfolders advanced permissions is not obeyed for subfolders

Moderate

[nickvergessen](/nickvergessen)
published
GHSA-m4wp-r357-4q94
Mar 8, 2022

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 20.0.14, < 21.0.6 , < 22.2.1

## Patched versions

20.0.14, 21.0.6 , 22.2.1

## Description

### Impact

The groupfolders application for Nextcloud allows sharing a folder with a group of people. In addition, it allows setting "advanced permissions" on subfolders, for example, a user could be granted access to the groupfolder but not specific subfolders.

Due to a lacking permission check, a user could still access these subfolders by copying the groupfolder to another location.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.14, 21.0.6 or 22.2.1.

### Workarounds

Disable the "groupfolders" application in the admin settings.

## Description

![@Dejagenkidama](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/40664180?v=4&size=48)[Dejagenkidama](https://github.com/Dejagenkidama)opened [on Oct 11, 2021](https://github.com/nextcloud/groupfolders/issues/1692#issue-1022729010)

Example:

Employee list / NC users:

MA1 site manager

MA2 accountant

MA3 project employee Lisa

MA4 project employee Hans

NC folder structure (group folder):

Group folder company location Berlin

...├── Administration

..........├── accounting

...├── projects

..........├── Project A

..........├── Project B

The following should be set via “Advanced Permissions”:

Write and read rights to all folders should have: MA1 site manager

Write and read rights to accounting folders should have: only MA2 accountant

Write and read rights to project folder A should have: only MA3 project employee Lisa

Write and read rights to project folder B should have: only MA4 project employee Hans

All of this is easy to set using the “Advanced Permissions” in the “Groupfolder”.

However…

For the root folder “Group folder company location Berlin”, all NC-users must have at least reading rights, otherwise you won’t see a folder at all…

“MA4 Projektmitarbeiter Hans” does not initially see the “Administration-Accounting” folder.

However, if he copies the complete root directory “Group folder company location Berlin” and inserts it into another of his own folders, all directories and their contents are visible to him.

Can this copying of the “invisible” folder or in general be prevented somehow?

How would you solve this problem?

Thank’s for the Tipps. Matthias

### @CarlSchwan **[CarlSchwan](/CarlSchwan)** commented [Oct 21, 2021](#issue-1032607440)

Using advanced ACL, it is possible that an user has access to a

directory but not to a subdirectory, so the copying use

Common::copyFromStorage instead of Local::copyFromStorage.

We might want to create a new interface instead of using directly

OCA\GroupFolder\ACLStorageWrapper
