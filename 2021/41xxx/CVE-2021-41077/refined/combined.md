Agree with other comments, people should get off Travis-CI immediately.

# [Security Bulletin](/t/security-bulletin/12081)

[Announcements](/c/announcements/15)

[Montana](https://travis-ci.community/u/Montana)

September 13, 2021, 8:36pm

Hey all,

According to a received report, a Public repository forked from another one could file a pull request (standard functionality e.g. in GitHub, BitBucket, Assembla) and while doing it, obtain unauthorized access to secret from the original Public repository with a condition of printing some of the files during the build process. \*\*In this scenario secrets are still encrypted in the Travis CI database.

*The issue is valid only for **public** repositories not Private repositories. (In case of Private repository, Repository Owner has a full control on ability of someone to fork the repository. )*

*Travis CI implemented a series of security patches starting on Sept 3rd that resolves this issue.*

*As a reminder, cycling your secrets is something that all users should do on a regular basis. If you are unsure how to do this please contact Support.*

**Does this bulletin effect me:**

* **This Security Bulletin does NOT affect any Private Repositories**
* **This Security Bulletin does NOT affect any Public Repositories that were NOT forked**
* If you have a Public Repository that was forked, then there was a possibility that someone from the forked (copied) project might have been able to have seen the original project’s Secret ONLY for a short time while doing a build.
* The Secret would not have the potential of being seen outside of a build process running given it is encrypted when not in use.
* Our competitors design and operate similarly with Public Repositories given industry standard 3rd party usage.
* We updated our servers on Sept 3rd to resolve this potential issue.
* To date, we found no evidence of unauthorized parties leveraging the potential exposure.
* We continue to recommend that both Public and Private Repository customers rotate their secrets on a regular basis.

**For more information on GitHub secrets rotation please visit the following links:**

* To create or rotate a token <https://github.com/settings/tokens>
* Use travis gem <https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb> to encrypt the secret for the repo (<https://github.com/travis-ci/travis.rb#encrypt>)
* Visit repo settings on [Travis CI - Test and Deploy with Confidence](https://app.travis-ci.com/github/qasimabdullah404/travis-slack-notifications-test/settings) and create environment variable
* GitHub docs on refreshing token ([Refreshing user-to-server access tokens - GitHub Docs](https://docs.github.com/en/developers/apps/building-github-apps/refreshing-user-to-server-access-tokens))

*Travis CI Team.*
