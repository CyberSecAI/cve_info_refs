| The application accepts a user-controlled input that specifies a link to an external site, and uses that link in a Redirect. This simplifies phishing attacks. ` Log off ``` def destroy   remove_session    # do we want to redirect externally?   path = params.permit(:continue)[:continue] || '/'    if path.include?("://")       authority = current_authority       uri = Addressable::URI.parse(path)        if uri.domain == authority.domain         path = "#{uri.request_uri}#{uri.fragment ? "##{uri.fragment}" : nil}"       else         path = authority.logout_url         if path.include?("continue=")           path = URI.decode_www_form_component(path.split("continue=", 2)[-1])         end       end   end    redirect_to path end  ```  `  [oredirect](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/91553733/135121169-6256b5b9-20a2-483d-93a4-50f6a24e1aee.png)  Payload: https:///auth/logout?continue=//<external\_domain> |

| The fix [395d1c5](https://github.com/PlaceOS/auth/commit/395d1c574e4cf292e62d28fe645812eb65022253) also vulnerable to open redirection.  For the payload "<https://test.com.au/auth/logout?continue=.attacker.com>" , the user will be redirected to "<https://test.com.au.attacker.com>" |
