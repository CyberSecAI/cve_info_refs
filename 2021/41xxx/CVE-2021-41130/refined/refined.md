Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-41130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Extensible Service Proxy (ESPv1) for Google Cloud Endpoints, when configured to authenticate JWT tokens, passes the verified JWT claims to the backend application via the `X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo` HTTP header.
- ESPv1 was vulnerable to header injection: if a client sends multiple `X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo` headers, ESPv1 would only replace the *first* occurrence with the validated JWT info and pass subsequent headers to the backend application without modification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Header Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for an attacker to inject a malicious `X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo` header that bypasses ESP's authentication.
- **Improper Input Handling:** ESPv1 did not properly sanitize or handle multiple occurrences of the `X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo` header.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Spoofed User Identity:** By sending a second crafted `X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo` header, an attacker can potentially spoof user identity and bypass authorization checks in the backend application.
- **Unauthorized Access:** If the backend application relies on the `X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo` header for authorization, a successful spoof can lead to unauthorized access to resources or functionalities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Multiple HTTP Headers:** The attack vector involves sending a request with multiple `X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo` headers. The first one will be replaced by ESP with correct info. The second one will be kept and forwarded to backend without checking.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Valid JWT Token:** The attacker needs to obtain or generate a valid JWT token that can be successfully verified by ESPv1. Generating a token can be easy for Google ID or Firebase, but difficult for tokens using JWKS with specific public keys.
-   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker must know that the target backend application uses the `X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo` header for authorization and does not use the first header deterministically. They would also need to be able to send the request with multiple headers to the backend service.

**Additional Notes from the Provided Content:**

-   **Affected Versions:**  ESPv1 versions prior to `v1.58.0` are affected.
-   **Patched Versions:**  The vulnerability is fixed in `v1.58.0`.
-   **Patching:** Users are advised to update their ESP docker images to `v1.58.0` or later. If they use the `:1` tag they need to restart their containers. If they are using a specific minor version such as `:1.57`, they need to update to `:1.58` and restart the container.
-   **Workarounds:** The advisory states that there are no workarounds.
-   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate."
-   The fix implemented was to remove all occurrences of the `X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo` header before adding the correct one. This prevents the backend from seeing multiple headers.
-   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-290, which is "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing."

In summary, this CVE describes a header injection vulnerability in ESPv1 that could lead to authorization bypass via manipulation of the `X-Endpoint-API-UserInfo` header when multiple such headers are present.
