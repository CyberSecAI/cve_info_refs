- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A missing optional stanza within a job specification was not correctly handled by Nomad when a job was configured to use a Consul mesh gateway and host networking mode.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Incomplete job specification handling leading to Nomad client agent crashes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service due to Nomad client agent crashes. Crashed clients can become lost, leading to reallocation and further crashes, potentially impacting the entire cluster.
- **Attack vectors:** Submitting incomplete job specifications to Nomad.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Authenticated users with job submission capabilities.
