Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper replay protection within the SAML SSO implementation in FortiClient EMS. This allows an attacker to intercept and reuse valid SAML authentication messages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass through SAML message replay: The system does not adequately validate the freshness or uniqueness of SAML messages, making it possible to reuse intercepted messages to gain unauthorized access.
- Insufficient replay protection: The system lacks mechanisms to detect and prevent the reuse of previously seen authentication messages.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Impersonation of existing users: A successful attack enables an unauthenticated attacker to impersonate any valid user.
- Privilege escalation: By impersonating a user, the attacker gains the privileges associated with that user.
- Unauthorized access to the system: An attacker can bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to the FortiClient EMS system and its resources.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network interception: The attacker needs to be positioned in the network to intercept SAML messages during the authentication process.
- Replay of intercepted messages: After capturing a valid SAML message, the attacker sends it again to the system, bypassing the intended authentication flow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the victim or be able to intercept network traffic to/from the FortiClient EMS server.
- Ability to intercept network traffic: This might involve techniques like ARP poisoning, man-in-the-middle attacks, or access to network devices with mirroring capabilities.
- Technical understanding of SAML protocol: The attacker needs to be able to intercept and potentially manipulate or replay SAML messages.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a medium severity issue.
- The vulnerability was internally discovered and reported by Fortinet.
- The affected product is FortiClientEMS version 7.0.1 and below.
- The fix for this vulnerability is upgrading to FortiClientEMS version 6.4.7 or above or 7.0.2 or above.
