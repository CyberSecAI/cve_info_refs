- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Inadequate file type validation on the client-side.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file upload vulnerability. The client-side file type check is easily bypassed.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can upload a malicious file, such as a PHP webshell, leading to potential remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability exists in the firmware upload section of the Socomec Remote View Pro application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have access to the firmware upload section of the application. They also need the ability to modify client-side checks or intercept the upload process to change file types.
