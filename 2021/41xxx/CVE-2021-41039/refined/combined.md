Package        : mosquitto
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-34434 CVE-2023-0809 CVE-2023-3592 CVE-2023-28366
                 CVE-2021-41039
Debian Bug     : 993400 1001028

Several security vulnerabilities have been discovered in mosquitto, a MQTT
compatible message broker, which may be abused for a denial of service attack.

CVE-2021-34434

    In Eclipse Mosquitto when using the dynamic security plugin, if the ability
    for a client to make subscriptions on a topic is revoked when a durable
    client is offline, then existing subscriptions for that client are not
    revoked.

CVE-2023-0809

    Fix excessive memory being allocated based on malicious initial packets
    that are not CONNECT packets.

CVE-2023-3592

    Fix memory leak when clients send v5 CONNECT packets with a will message
    that contains invalid property types.

CVE-2023-28366

    The broker in Eclipse Mosquitto has a memory leak that can be abused
    remotely when a client sends many QoS 2 messages with duplicate message
    IDs, and fails to respond to PUBREC commands. This occurs because of
    mishandling of EAGAIN from the libc send function.

Additionally CVE-2021-41039 has been fixed for Debian 11 "Bullseye".

CVE-2021-41039

    An MQTT v5 client connecting with a large number of user-property
    properties could cause excessive CPU usage, leading to a loss of
    performance and possible denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.0.11-1+deb11u1.

For the stable distribution (bookworm), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.0.11-1.2+deb12u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your mosquitto packages.

For the detailed security status of mosquitto please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/mosquitto>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Then broker will parse all of them and store in a linked list. When checking for the uniqueness of “properties” in CONNECT packet, the linked list will traverse with O(n^2) complexity,  In our tests, it takes only 64KB per package to have an impact in our cloud server with 1 core(20 processes sending packages simultaneously). So it's only limited by max packet size.   # lib\property_mosq.c:186(property__read_all)  In this function, broker parse and store the properties include "user properties".  # lib\property_mosq.c:963(mosquitto_property_check_all)  int mosquitto_property_check_all(int command, const mosquitto_property *properties) {        ...       ...  	while(p){  		...                 ...  		tail = p->next; 		while(tail){ 			if(p->identifier == tail->identifier 					&& p->identifier != MQTT_PROP_USER_PROPERTY){  				return MOSQ_ERR_DUPLICATE_PROPERTY; 			} 			tail = tail->next; 		}  		p = p->next; 	}  	return MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS; } ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=575314#c1)  Wayne Beaton [CLA](https://wiki.eclipse.org/ECA)    2021-08-09 13:27:12 EDT  ``` /cc project lead.

# [Bug 575314] Possible DoS Attack caused by unlimited number of "user properties" in Mosquitto Broker

|  |  |
| --- | --- |
| Bugzilla Link | [575314](https://bugs.eclipse.org/bugs/show_bug.cgi?id=575314) |
| Status | ASSIGNED |
| Importance | P3 normal |
| Reported | Aug 09, 2021 09:47 EDT |

## Description

We have found a DOS attack which can be triggered by CONNECT packets which contain lots of "user properties". Then broker will parse all of them and store in a linked list. When checking for the uniqueness of “properties” in CONNECT packet, the linked list will traverse with O(n^2) complexity,

In our tests, it takes only 64KB per package to have an impact in our cloud server with 1 core(20 processes sending packages simultaneously). So it's only limited by max packet size.

# lib\property\_mosq.c:186(property\_\_read\_all)

In this function, broker parse and store the properties include "user properties".

# lib\property\_mosq.c:963(mosquitto\_property\_check\_all)

int mosquitto\_property\_check\_all(int command, const mosquitto\_property \*properties)

{

```
  ...\
  ...

while(p){

	...\
            ...

	tail = p->next;\
	while(tail){\
		if(p->identifier == tail->identifier\
				&& p->identifier != MQTT_PROP_USER_PROPERTY){

			return MOSQ_ERR_DUPLICATE_PROPERTY;\
		}\
		tail = tail->next;\
	}

	p = p->next;\
}

return MOSQ_ERR_SUCCESS;\
```

}
