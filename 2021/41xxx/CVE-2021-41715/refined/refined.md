The content relates to CVE-2021-41715.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free in `libsixel/src/dither.c`. It occurs when the code attempts to access a memory region that has already been freed. The specific trigger is when a 0-entry table is requested. This happens during image processing, specifically in the dithering stage.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free vulnerability in `sixel_dither_unref` at `dither.c:388`
- Uninitialized values are used in `sixel_quant_make_palette`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to accessing freed memory (heap-use-after-free)
- Undefined behavior from use of uninitialized values

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted image file that causes a zero-entry table to be requested during the dithering process.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a malicious image file to be processed by the vulnerable `libsixel` library.
