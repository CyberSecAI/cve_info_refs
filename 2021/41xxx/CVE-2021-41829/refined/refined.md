Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41829:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The ManageEngine Remote Access Plus application uses the build number of the application to calculate a password/key.
*   This credential derivation method is hardcoded within the source code (specifically in the `DCBackupRestore.jar` file).
*   The hardcoded key is used to encrypt backup files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Statically derived encryption key:** The encryption key is not generated randomly or securely, but is derived from the application's build number. This makes it predictable and the same for all installations of a specific build.
*   **Hardcoded value:** The key derivation logic is hardcoded and can be easily reverse engineered from the application's JAR file.
*    **Improper file permissions:**  The backup files are also subject to improper file permission vulnerabilities, enabling attackers to easily steal the encrypted backup files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Decryption of backup files:** An attacker can obtain the static key by reverse engineering the application and then use it to decrypt backup files.
*   **Exposure of sensitive information:** The backup files contain sensitive data, including:
    *   Server configurations
    *   Database contents
    *   Enterprise system/user details
    *   System information
    *   Vulnerability and patch status

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Reverse engineering:** An attacker can reverse engineer the `DCBackupRestore.jar` file to extract the hardcoded key derivation method.
*   **File access:** With improper file permissions, attackers can access the encrypted backup files.
*   **Offline attack:** Since the key is statically derived and the backup files can be accessed, the attack can be performed offline without needing active access to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Access to the application's JAR file:** The attacker needs to be able to obtain the `DCBackupRestore.jar` file to reverse engineer the key derivation method.
*  **Access to encrypted backup files:** Attackers need access to the backup files. This can be obtained through improper file permissions.
*   **Reverse engineering skills:** The attacker needs to have the ability to reverse engineer Java code to understand the key derivation logic.

**Additional notes:**

* The vulnerability is described as having a "High Severity" with a CVSS score of 7.1
* The vulnerability was fixed in version 10.1.2121.1 of ManageEngine Remote Access Plus.
* The vendor's release notes state: "From now on, the database backup password will be newly generated and randomized (CVE-2021-41827)." which indicates the method of key generation was changed to mitigate this issue.

This vulnerability allowed attackers to decrypt sensitive information contained in the application's backup files.
