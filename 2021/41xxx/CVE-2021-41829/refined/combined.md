# Status: Fixed (As on 27-Aug-2021)

Fixed version: **10.1.2121.1 (**[**Change log**](https://www.manageengine.com/remote-desktop-management/hotfix-readme.html)**)**

CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N = 7.1 (**High Severity**)

CVE-2021–41829

**Impacted Component**: Remote Access Plus (RAP) Server (Desktop App)

**Vulnerability Description**: It was observed that the Zoho remote access plus application makes use of build number of the application to calculate password/key. Credential derivation method is hardcoded within the source code, which can be reverse engineered very easily (DCBackupRestore Jar file present within lib). The product is also vulnerable to [Improper file permission](/%40kartiklalan/vulnerability-disclosure-improper-filesystem-permission-misconfigured-acls-zoho-r-a-p-56e195464b51), due to which the encrypted backup can be stolen very easily and can be decrypted via making use of this vulnerability.

**Impact rational**: This static key was used for encryption of the Backup files, which consists of all other sensitive info like server config, DB, entire enterprise system/user detail, all other system info., their vulnerability/patch status, and many other details.

**Exploitability rational**:

Since it is statically derived value, which remains same across all installations for a build, finding password/key doesn’t need system access and can be harvested from anywhere (and the app is easily downloadable over the internet). Moreover, [static/hardcoded values are one of the most hazardous vulnerabilities](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Use_of_hard-coded_password) which can be found via R.E. in managed/unmanaged code.

**Steps to Reproduce & Supportive Evidence**:

RE of the un-obfuscated code gives you the details. (DCBackupRestore Jar file present within lib, can be opened in tools like JDGui)

**Recommendation**:

1. SecureRandom function can be used to generate credentials on the first time of installation to have different creds. across all installations.
2. For storage prefer vault / seek user input there by via PBKDF2 encrypt / Leveraging on Windows Auth. For connection string rely on filesystem ACL in worst case.
