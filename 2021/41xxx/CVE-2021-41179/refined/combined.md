# Two-Factor Authentication not enforced for pages marked as public

High

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-7hvh-rc6f-px23
Oct 25, 2021

## Package

Server
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 20.0.13, < 21.0.5 , < 22.2.0

## Patched versions

20.0.13, 21.0.5, 22.2.0

## Description

### Impact

The Two-Factor Authentication wasn't enforced for pages marked as public. Any page marked as `@PublicPage` could thus be accessed with a valid user session that isn't authenticated.

This particularly affects the Nextcloud Talk application, as this could be leveraged to gain access to any private chat channel without going through the Two-Factor flow.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.13, 21.0.5 or 22.2.0.

### Workarounds

None.

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/1322865)

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41179

### Weaknesses

[CWE-304](/advisories?query=cwe%3A304)
