Adding a check for negative sizes prevents this.

# Segfault due to negative splits in `SplitV`

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-cpf4-wx82-gxp6
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e71b86d47f8bc1816bf54d7bddc4170e47670b97/tensorflow/core/kernels/split_v_op.cc#L49-L205) of `SplitV` can trigger a segfault is an attacker supplies negative arguments:

```
import tensorflow as tf

tf.raw_ops.SplitV(
  value=tf.constant([]),
  size_splits=[-1, -2]
  ,axis=0,
  num_split=2)
```

This occurs whenever `size_splits` contains more than one value and at least one value is negative.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [25d622ffc432acc736b14ca3904177579e733cc6](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/25d622ffc432acc736b14ca3904177579e733cc6).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41222

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
