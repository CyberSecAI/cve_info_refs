Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41222:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `SplitV` operation in TensorFlow not properly handling negative values in the `size_splits` argument. Specifically, a negative size in one of the split sizes allowed the computed size of another to exceed the total dimension, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The `SplitV` operation failed to validate that the provided split sizes are non-negative which caused out-of-bounds access.
- Integer overflow/underflow:  A negative value in `size_splits` could cause the calculation of the remaining size to underflow, leading to incorrect memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault: By providing negative values in `size_splits`, an attacker can trigger a segmentation fault, potentially crashing the application using the TensorFlow library.
- Denial of Service: The crash can be used to create a denial of service attack against TensorFlow based applications.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious Input: An attacker can provide carefully crafted input to the `SplitV` operation, containing negative values in the `size_splits` argument.
- API call: The `tf.raw_ops.SplitV` function is called with specific crafted arguments to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control input: The attacker must be able to control or influence the input to the `SplitV` operation within a TensorFlow-based system. This could occur through a machine learning model, data processing pipeline, or any application which uses this functionality.
- No special permissions needed: The attacker does not need elevated privileges or local access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding a check for negative sizes to prevent the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is patched in TensorFlow versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2, and 2.6.1.
- This issue was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
- The provided commit `25d622ffc432acc736b14ca3904177579e733cc6` contains the fix.
