Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the implementation of `FusedBatchNorm` kernels in TensorFlow. Specifically, the `FusedBatchNormGrad` operation was found to be susceptible to a heap out-of-bounds (OOB) write due to missing shape validation checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Heap Out-of-Bounds Write:** The core vulnerability is a heap OOB write. This occurs when the code attempts to write data outside the allocated memory region, potentially corrupting other data in the heap, leading to crashes or unexpected behavior.
*   **Missing Shape Validation:** The vulnerability exists due to the absence of proper checks on the shapes of input tensors (`x`, `scale`, `reserve_space_1`, `reserve_space_2`, and `y_backprop`) in the `FusedBatchNormGrad` kernel. The code assumed specific shape compatibility, which could be violated by maliciously crafted inputs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit of this OOB write can lead to a crash of the TensorFlow process, causing a denial of service.
*   **Potential for arbitrary code execution:** Although not explicitly mentioned, heap overflows can sometimes lead to more severe consequences such as arbitrary code execution by overwriting function pointers or other critical data on the heap. The provided information does not specify if this is the case, but it is a potential risk in such scenarios.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the TensorFlow API, specifically by calling the `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNormGrad` operation with carefully crafted input tensors that do not conform to the expected shapes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to execute TensorFlow code. They could be a user of a TensorFlow application or a model builder who can provide a malicious input. They don't necessarily need privileged access to the system but require the ability to control the inputs to the vulnerable TensorFlow operations.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when the input tensors `x`, `scale`, `reserve_space_1` and `reserve_space_2` to `tf.raw_ops.FusedBatchNormGrad` have incompatible shapes.
*   The provided code snippet demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability affects TensorFlow versions prior to 2.7.0. Patches have been applied to versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2, and 2.6.1.
*   The fix includes adding shape validation checks to the `FusedBatchNorm` kernels, as shown in the provided commit diff. These checks ensure that the shapes of the input tensors are compatible, preventing the OOB write.
