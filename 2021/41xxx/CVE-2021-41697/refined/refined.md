Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `assets/sources/instagram.php` file, where the script directly echoes the value of the `error_description` GET parameter without any sanitization or encoding.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, caused by directly outputting user-controlled input within the HTML context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the webpage. This can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Malware Delivery:** Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   **Phishing Attacks:** Displaying fake login forms to steal user credentials.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance of the page.
    *   **Information Theft:** Accessing sensitive information on the page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript code within the `error_description` parameter. The attacker would need to entice a user to click on this malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send this URL to a victim, typically by social engineering, email, or another means of communication.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (POC) clearly shows how to trigger the XSS by inserting a `<script>` tag into the `error_description` parameter.
