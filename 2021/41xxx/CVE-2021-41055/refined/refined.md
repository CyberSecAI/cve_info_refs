{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Gajim does not filter repeating message IDs in Multi-User Chats (MUC), while it does for regular messages. When a message correction is received with an ID that has already been processed and removed from the `corrected_text_list`, a `KeyError` occurs, leading to a crash.  Sending the same correction message again can lead to a crash in GTK and potentially cause a permanent crash, even after restarting Gajim.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Incorrect handling of message correction IDs in MUC.",
     "Missing check for already processed message IDs in `corrected_text_list`"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious or faulty MUC participant can cause Gajim to crash, potentially making the client unusable. The crash can be permanent, requiring a fresh start of the client to resume functionality.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious MUC participant sends a message, and then multiple correction messages with the same id.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a participant in the Multi-User Chat."
