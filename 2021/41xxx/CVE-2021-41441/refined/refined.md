Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details related to CVE-2021-41441:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is an authenticated relative path overwrite, which suggests an issue with how the device handles file paths, potentially allowing an attacker to manipulate them to overwrite existing files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authenticated Relative Path Overwrite:** This is the core vulnerability. The device does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied relative paths, allowing authenticated users to overwrite files, possibly leading to a denial-of-service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability allows overwriting of files, potentially system-critical ones, leading to a denial-of-service situation where the device becomes unstable or unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attack requires the attacker to be authenticated to the device's web interface.
- **Relative Path Manipulation:** The attacker uses relative paths to target specific files for overwriting, by manipulating file path parameters in requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid user credentials to access the device's web interface.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the network where the D-Link router is located.
- **Knowledge of Path Structure:** Some knowledge of the underlying file system path structure on the D-Link router might be necessary to craft specific relative paths for overwriting targeted files.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specifically fixed in firmware version v1.10WWB09_Beta for the DIR-X1860 router.
- The content also states that the patch provided is beta software and to proceed with caution before installing.
- The information provided is more detailed than the CVE description, as it lists the specific vulnerability type and provides context about the affected devices and fixed versions.
