- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize the `browser_today` parameter, which is collected from user browsers and used on multiple pages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can craft a malicious HTML form with JavaScript, and through social engineering, convince logged-in users to submit the form. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request containing malicious JavaScript in the `browser_today` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious HTML form and convince a logged-in user to submit this form. This involves social engineering to trick the user into executing the POST request.
