# Reflected XSS vulnerability - not checking browser\_today parameter for sanity

Low

[anuko](/anuko)
published
GHSA-g9cc-m4p4-6xpc
Oct 18, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.19.30.5601

## Patched versions

 1.19.30.5601

## Description

### Impact

Time Tracker uses browser\_today hidden control on a few pages to collect the today's date from user browsers. Because of not checking this parameter for sanity in versions prior to 1.19.30.5601, it was possible to craft an html form with malicious JavaScript, use social engineering to convince logged on users to execute a POST from such form, and have the attacker-supplied JavaScript to be executed in user's browser.

### Patches

Patched in version 1.19.30.5600.

### Workarounds

Upgrade is recommended. If it is not practical, introduce ttValidDbDateFormatDate function as in the latest version and add a call to it within the access checks block in the following files:

expense\_edit.php

expenses.php

login.php

puncher.php

time.php

time\_edit.php

week.php

For example:

```
if ($request->isPost()) {
  // Validate that browser_today parameter is in correct format.
  $browser_today = $request->getParameter('browser_today');
  if ($browser_today && !ttValidDbDateFormatDate($browser_today)) {
    header('Location: access_denied.php');
    exit();
  }
}
// End of access checks.

```
