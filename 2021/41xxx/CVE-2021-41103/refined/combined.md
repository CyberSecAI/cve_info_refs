# Insufficiently restricted permissions on container root and plugin directories

Moderate

[dmcgowan](/dmcgowan)
published
GHSA-c2h3-6mxw-7mvq
Oct 4, 2021

## Package

gomod

github.com/containerd/containerd
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<1.4.11,<1.5.7

## Patched versions

1.4.11,1.5.7

## Description

### Impact

A bug was found in containerd where container root directories and some plugins had insufficiently restricted permissions, allowing otherwise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the host collided with the file owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host could discover, read, and modify those files.

### Patches

This vulnerability has been fixed in containerd 1.4.11 and containerd 1.5.7. Users should update to these version when they are released and may restart containers or update directory permissions to mitigate the vulnerability.

### Workarounds

Limit access to the host to trusted users. Update directory permission on container bundles directories.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [github.com/containerd/containerd](https://github.com/containerd/containerd/issues/new/choose)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-df975338d4
2021-10-19 00:36:08.674370
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : moby-engine
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 20.10.9
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <https://www.docker.com>
Summary : The open-source application container engine
Description :
Docker is an open source project to build, ship and run any application as a
lightweight container.

Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means
they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and
everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular
language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks
for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without
depending on a particular stack or provider.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Security fixes for moby-engine and containerd containerd: - fixes
CVE-2021-41103 - Fix insufficiently restricted permissions on container root and
plugin directories - update to upstream 1.5.7 moby-engine: - fixes
CVE-2021-41092, CVE-2021-41089 and CVE-2021-41091 - patches seccomp policy to
fix clone3() issue - update to upstream 20.10.9
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
ChangeLog:

\* Fri Oct 8 2021 Maxwell G gotmax@e.email - 20.10.9-1
- Update to 20.10.9 (fixes rhbz#2010508)
- Patch seccomp policy to fix clone3() issue (fixes rhbz#2011523 and rhbz#1988199)
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SCALANCE LPE9000 (Local Processing Engine) extends the SCALANCE family portfolio by a component
that provides computing power for a wide range of applications in the network, close to the process –
Edge Computing.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-27304

The CivetWeb web library does not validate uploaded ﬁlepaths when running on an OS other
than Windows, when using the built-in HTTP form-based ﬁle upload mechanism, via the
mg_handle_form_request API. Web applications that use the ﬁle upload form handler, and use
parts of the user-controlled ﬁlename in the output path, are susceptible to directory traversal

Vulnerability CVE-2021-20317

A corrupted timer tree caused the task wakeup to be missing in the timerqueue_add function in
lib/timerqueue.c. This ﬂaw allows a local attacker with special user privileges to cause a denial of
service, slowing and eventually stopping the system while running OSP.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-41089

A vulnerability was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where attempting to copy ﬁles using docker cp
into a specially-crafted container can result in Unix ﬁle permission changes for existing ﬁles in the
host’s ﬁlesystem, widening access to others. This bug does not directly allow ﬁles to be read, modiﬁed,

Vulnerability CVE-2021-41091

A vulnerability was found in Moby (Docker Engine) where the data directory (typically
/var/lib/docker) contained subdirectories with insufﬁciently restricted permissions, allowing other-
wise unprivileged Linux users to traverse directory contents and execute programs. When containers
included executable programs with extended permission bits (such as setuid), unprivileged Linux
users could discover and execute those programs. When the UID of an unprivileged Linux user on the
host collided with the ﬁle owner or group inside a container, the unprivileged Linux user on the host
could discover, read, and modify those ﬁles.

Debian Security Advisory DSA-5002-1                   security@debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/security/>                     Salvatore Bonaccorso

Package        : containerd
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-41103

A flaw was discovered in containerd, an open and reliable container
runtime. Insufficiently restricted permissions on container root and
plugin directories could result in privilege escalation.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 1.4.5~ds1-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your containerd packages.

For the detailed security status of containerd please refer to its
security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/containerd>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://www.debian.org/security/>

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-b5a9a481a2
2021-10-29 22:48:33.391790
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : moby-engine
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 20.10.9
Release : 1.fc35
URL : <https://www.docker.com>
Summary : The open-source application container engine
Description :
Docker is an open source project to build, ship and run any application as a
lightweight container.

Docker containers are both hardware-agnostic and platform-agnostic. This means
they can run anywhere, from your laptop to the largest EC2 compute instance and
everything in between - and they don't require you to use a particular
language, framework or packaging system. That makes them great building blocks
for deploying and scaling web apps, databases, and backend services without
depending on a particular stack or provider.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Update Information:

Security fixes for moby-engine and containerd containerd: - fixes
CVE-2021-41103 - Fix insufficiently restricted permissions on container root and
