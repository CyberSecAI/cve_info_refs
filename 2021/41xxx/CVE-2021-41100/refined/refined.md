- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to change a user's email address using only a short-lived session token in the `Authorization` header. This token was intended for less critical requests, but it was being used to modify sensitive user information (email address).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation. The short-lived token, meant for authentication of non-critical requests, allowed modification of email addresses, leading to account takeover.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change a user's email address, then change the user's password after setting the email address to an attacker-controlled one, leading to full account takeover.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with access to a user's short-lived token (usually transmitted in an HTTP header) can exploit the vulnerability by sending a request to change the email address.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have access to a user's short-lived session token, which, although meant to be short lived and less critical, might be exposed in transit more often than long-lived cookies.
