Subject: [Lightning-dev] Full Disclosure: CVE-2021-41591/ CVE-2021-41592 /
CVE-2021-41593 "Dust HTLC Exposure Considered Harmful"
Message-ID:
Hi,
I'm writing a report to disclose specification-level vulnerabilities
affecting the Lightning implementations.
The vulnerabilities are expected to be patched in:
\* Eclair: v0.6.2+ (CVE-2021-41591)
\* LND: v0.13.3+ (CVE-2021-41592)
\* LDK: v0.0.102 (not released as production software yet)
The vulnerabilities are also affecting c-lightning (CVE-2021-41593).
Those vulnerabilities can be exploited in a wide range of attacks, going
from fee blackmailing of node operators, burning liquidity of your
competing LSPs or even stealing your counterparty channel balance if you
avail mining capabilities. Exercise of the vulnerability revealed that a
majority of the balance funds can be at loss.
Credit to Eugene Siegel (Crypt-iQ) for reporting the trimmed-to-dust
exploitation and multiple insights about attacks.
Thanks to Bastien Teinturier and Matt Corallo for numerous contributions
about mitigations development.
# Problem
The current BOLT specification only requires Alice's `dust\_limit\_satoshis`
(applied on Alice's commitment) to be under Alice's
`channel\_reserve\_satoshis` (applied on Bob). As those 2 parameters are
selectable by Alice, she can inflate the dust limit until reaching the
implementation-defined max value (e.g LND: 20% of chan capacity, LDK: 100%
of chan capacity).
Any in-flight incoming HTLC under Alice's dust limit will be converted as
miner fees on Alice's commitment. This HTLC is deducted from Bob's balance
and as such they're still owned by Bob, until resolution (i.e a RAA
removing the HTLC from Alice's commitment). This limitation only applies
per-HTLC. No implementation enforces a limit on the sum of in-flight HTLCs
burned as fees. Therefore, Alice is free to inflict a substantial loss to
Bob funds by publishing her commitment on-chain.
In-flight outgoing HTLC are also committed as fees on Bob's commitment if
they're under Bob's threshold. Alice can also exploit from this angle by
circular routing HTLCs until reaching Bob's
`max\_htlc\_value\_in\_flight\_msat`. Alice withholds HTLCs resolution until Bob
goes on-chain to timeout an offered HTLC or claim an accepted HTLC.
Dust HTLC processing can be also exploited at `update\_fee` reception.
As the BOLT3's fees computation encompasses the negotiated feerate from
`update\_fee` for the 2nd-stage HTLC fees to decide if the HTLC must be
trimmed, the amount of balance at risk is a function of current mempool
feerates.
The maximum of funds at risk on a counterparty commitment is:
counterparty's `max\_accepted\_htlcs` \* (`htlc\_success\_tx\_kw` \* opener's
`feerate\_per\_kw` + counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis`) + holder's
`max\_accepted\_htlcs` \* (`htlc\_timeout\_tx\_kw` \* opener's `feerate\_per\_kw` +
counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis`)
If the opener is also the attacker, the negotiated feerate can be
manipulated beyond the "honest" mempool feerates only upper bounded
implementation-defined value (before fixes, LDK: 2 \* high-feerate of our
fee-estimator). If the opener is the victim, the negotiated feerate is
still a safety concern in case of spontaneous mempool spikes.
Note, `anchors\_zero\_htlc\_fee` channels are not affected by the feerate
inflation as the trimmed-to-dust fee computation mechanism for 2nd-stage
HTLC is removed. They're still at risk of the sum of the HTLCs under the
dust limit being maliciously burned.
# Solution
A first mitigation is to verify the counterparty's announced
`dust\_limit\_satoshis` at channel opening (`open\_channel`/`accept\_channel`)
reception and reject if it's estimated too large (see #894)
For LDK, we choose the value of 660 satoshis as it's beyond the highest
dust threshold enforced by Bitcoin Core (p2pkh: 546) with a margin of
safety. Propagation of Lightning time-sensitive transactions shouldn't be
affected.
A second mitigation is to define a new configurable limit
`max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure` and apply this one at incoming and outgoing of
HTLC.
For LDK, we choose the value of 5 000 000 milli-satoshis as we gauged this
value as a substantial loss for our class of users. Setting this too low
may prevent the sending or receipt of low-value HTLCs on high-traffic
nodes. A node operator should fine-tune this value in function of what
qualifies as an acceptable loss.
We would like to ensure that the node isn't suddenly exposed to
significantly more trimmed balance if the feerate increases when we have
several HTLCs pending which are near the dust limit.
To achieve this goal, we introduce a new `dust\_buffer\_feerate` defined as
the maximum of either 2530 sats per kWU or 125% of the current
`feerate\_per\_kw` (implementation-defined values).
Then, upon an incoming HTLC, if the HTLC's `amount\_msat` is inferior to the
counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis` plus the HTLC-timeout fee at the
`dust\_buffer\_feerate`. If the `amount\_msat` plus the
`dust\_balance\_on\_counterparty\_tx` is superior to `max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure`,
the HTLC should be failed once it's committed.
Upon an outgoing HTLC, if the HTLC's `amount\_msat` is inferior to the
counterparty's `dust\_limit\_satoshis` plus the HTLC-success fee at the
`dust\_buffer\_feerate`. If the `amount\_msat` plus the
`dust\_balance\_on\_counterparty\_tx` is superior to `max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure`,
the HTLC should not be sent and fail without forwarding.
The check symmetry must also be applied on holder commitment transactions.
See PR #919 for more details.
A last mitigation is ensuring that at `update\_fee` reception, the pending
`dust\_balance` at the new proposed feerate isn't superior to
`max\_dust\_htlc\_exposure\_msat`.
# Background
The dust limit is a base layer policy stopping the relay of a transaction
if one of its outputs is under a given threshold. The goal of this policy
is to prevent the pollution of the UTXO set with low-value outputs and as
such increase the amount of work done by full-nodes.
Lightning commitment transactions should be able to propagate at any point
during the channel lifetime to unilaterally enforce on-chain a balance. A
Lightning commitment transaction with one of its outputs below the dust
limit would fail to relay and thus jeopardizes funds safety.
To prevent this, BOLT2 requires counterparties to announce a
`dust\_limit\_satoshis` during channel opening (at
`open\_channel`/`accept\_channel` exchange). This `dust\_limit\_satoshis` must
be under the same party's `channel\_reserve\_satoshis`. This value is static
for the channel lifetime.
During commitment signatures exchange, each counterparty's limit is applied
on each counterparty's commitment (e.g A's `dust\_limit\_satoshis` is applied
on A's commitment, though both A and B have to generate and sign the
transaction). An output below this limit is trimmed to fees and won't
materialize on the commitment.
The specification didn't require that the `open\_channel`/`accept\_channel`
receiver verify that the announced `dust\_limit\_satoshis` isn't too large.
The specification didn't require that the sum of the dust HTLC committed as
fees was verified against an upper bound.
# Discovery
Vulnerabilities around our dust HTLC processing have been known for years
by some LN developers/researchers.
During Q1 2019, private discussions on the Rust-Lightning-side (LDK before
marketing rebranding) about potential safety risks around dust HTLC
processing.
In November 2019, Rusty Russell (c-lightning) opened an issue against the
specification mentioning the lack of check of counterparty's dust limit
(#696).
In May 2020, I published a high-level attack scenario "Miners Dust
Inflation attacks on Lightning Network", leveraging this lack.
In February 2021, I did a test of the first vulnerability against LND
software and successfully burnt the majority of the targeted node balance
in fees. As it sounds to me like a check missing in the specification, I
notified CL/LND/Eclair/LDK maintainers. Mitigations started to be developed
on the LDK-side.
In July 2021, in the context of `option\_dusty\_htlcs\_uncounted` discussions,
Eugene Spiegel (LND) reported on how to exploit the trimmed-to-dust
mechanism at `update\_fee` reception. Discussions followed on the best way
to mitigate this new vector.
During August 2021, mitigations were developed and released on the
LDK-side. vulnerabilities were disclosed to other Lightning projects (Muun
wallet, Electrum). From the LDK-side, a public disclosure date was proposed.
Still during August 2021, the Bitcoin Core dust limit was actively
discussed on the mailing list. Changes of this dust limit would have
affected the ongoing development of the mitigations.
While this report highlights the lack of well-defined communication process
across Lightning teams, developers from 3 different implementations have
actively participated in the vulnerabilities diagnostic and mitigations
development of those long-standing specification issues affecting the whole
Lightning ecosystem.
All mistakes and opinions are my own and please verify any information
reported.

# Displaying verification statuses for all of your commits

You can enable vigilant mode for commit signature verification to mark all of your commits and tags with a signature verification status.

## In this article

* [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)
* [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)
## [About vigilant mode](#about-vigilant-mode)

When you work locally on your computer, Git allows you to set the author of your changes and the identity of the committer. This, potentially, makes it difficult for other people to be confident that commits and tags you create were actually created by you. To help solve this problem you can sign your commits and tags. For more information, see [Signing commits](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-commits) and [Signing tags](/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/signing-tags). GitHub marks signed commits and tags with a verification status.

By default commits and tags are marked "Verified" if they are signed with a GPG, SSH, or S/MIME key that was successfully verified. If a commit or tag has a signature that can't be verified by GitHub, we mark the commit or tag "Unverified." In all other cases no verification status is displayed.

However, you can give other users increased confidence in the identity attributed to your commits and tags by enabling vigilant mode in your GitHub settings. With vigilant mode enabled, all of your commits and tags are marked with one of three verification statuses:

| Status | Description |
| --- | --- |
| **Verified** | The commit is signed, the signature was successfully verified, and the committer is the only author who has enabled vigilant mode. |
| **Partially verified** | The commit is signed, and the signature was successfully verified, but the commit has an author who: a) is not the committer and b) has enabled vigilant mode. In this case, the commit signature doesn't guarantee the consent of the author, so the commit is only partially verified. |
| **Unverified** | Any of the following is true:- The commit is signed but the signature could not be verified.- The commit is not signed and the committer has enabled vigilant mode.- The commit is not signed and an author has enabled vigilant mode. |

You should only enable vigilant mode if you sign all of your commits and tags and use an email address that is verified for your account on GitHub as your committer email address. After enabling this mode, any unsigned commits or tags that you generate locally and push to GitHub will be marked "Unverified."

You can check the verification status of your signed commits or tags on GitHub and view why your commit signatures might be unverified. For more information, see [Checking your commit and tag signature verification status](/en/authentication/troubleshooting-commit-signature-verification/checking-your-commit-and-tag-signature-verification-status).

## [Enabling vigilant mode](#enabling-vigilant-mode)

1. In the upper-right corner of any page on GitHub, click your profile photo, then click  **Settings**.
2. In the "Access" section of the sidebar, click  **SSH and GPG keys**.
3. Under "Vigilant mode," select **Flag unsigned commits as unverified**.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.

# Good Griefing: A Lingering Vulnerability On Lightning Network That Still Needs Fixing

The potential for “griefing” attacks on Bitcoin’s Lightning Network is a serious threat. Here’s how they work and why they deserve a fix.

* Author:[Jestopher](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/authors/jestopher)
* Publish date:Jan 18, 2021

![The Lightning Network has unleashed an entirely new set of accounting, audit and tax challenges. But how will they be resolved?](https://bitcoinmagazine.com/.image/t_share/MTc5Mjk3ODA4NjI0Nzg5MTg3/bitcoin-lightning-network-accounting-challenges.jpg)

The Lightning Network has unleashed an entirely new set of accounting, audit and tax challenges. But how will they be resolved?

What happens when your Lightning Network routing node is fed with garbage transactions that never resolve? In short, it causes a lot of grief for routing nodes. What was once a smooth, global payment system can be locked up with trivial effort from a savvy script writer.

Working in a small team of routing nodes, we successfully ran a test of the attack with real funds and demonstrated the "[griefing](https://ethereum.stackexchange.com/questions/62829/what-does-griefing-mean)" attack described by [Joost Jager](https://github.com/lightningequipment/circuitbreaker). The attack is called a grief attack since it is not a theft of funds, but it causes a victim's Lightning funds to be frozen: a major upset. What we found is that griefing is a serious threat to large "wumbo" channels expecting to earn a yield on their bitcoin, only to have their funds frozen for a period of time.

This is mostly a grief attack: no loss of funds, but the victim may be forced to pay for an expensive channel force close. This is a known vulnerability on mainnet Lightning and it needs to be understood and prioritized, especially at this early market stage of Bitcoin's Lightning Network.

Thanks to Clark Burkhardt and Phillip Sheppard for their willingness to participate in this test and to Jager for his tireless work to bring attention and priority to this vulnerability. Jager played the role of the attacker for our demonstration, while Burkhardt and Sheppard joined me as connected victim routing nodes.

## How The Attack Works

The attacker saturates one (or several) channel(s) with Hashed Time Locked Contracts (HTLCs) that don't resolve as a finalized payment. These are a special breed of HTLCs known as HODL invoices. Only 483 of these unresolved HTLCs are required to overwhelm a channel per direction. Once those HTLCs are in the channel, any transactions using that same channel direction are impossible, including a transaction to cooperatively close that channel.

In theory, an attacker could contact the victim (perhaps via a keysend message or in an "onion blob") and demand a ransom be paid to halt the attack. Once the ransom is paid, the attacker could remove the unresolved payments, ending the attack. The attack can be sustained indefinitely, halting all routing and payment activity in that channel. This freezes the funds in the Lightning channel.

Both directions of payments can be stalled in a channel by using 483 HTLCs in each direction, both inbound and outbound.

## Why Would An Attacker Do Something Like This?

The first motive that comes to mind is to demand a ransom. This attack causes pain for the victim and paying a ransom may be attractive to a victim, even without assurance that the attack would stop. Contacting the victim might be risky for an attacker, but a ransom payment might not be the only reason someone would do this.

A secondary incentive for launching a griefing attack would be to disrupt routing competition. Jamming a competitor's route could create more demand for a route owned by an attacker.

As a benchmark, consider that Lightning Labs' Loop node has an ongoing demand for liquidity for which it will sometimes pay a 2,500 parts per million of the payment (ppm) (0.25 percent) fee rate. In my experience, they would normally exhaust 16 million sats’ worth of liquidity in about two weeks (5.2 percent annual percentage rate), but that is with competition present.

If an attacker could disable any competing route with lower fee rates, Loop may be willing to pay a higher fee rate (since the supply of liquidity is now reduced). Let's say Loop would pay 3,000 ppm (0.3 percent), as well as use that liquidity more quickly since no other channels are functioning. Loop might use that liquidity in half the time, say one week. The attacker would more than double their usual yield to 15.6 percent APR in this example. The only cost to the attacker is the cost of running a script on an existing channel and the psychological cost of doing something immoral/damaging to the Lightning Network. With a single attacker channel, a malicious actor could jam about nine channels (see [Jager’s tweets about this](https://twitter.com/joostjgr/status/1309516114628620288?s=19)).

## What Would The Victim Of This Attack Experience?

The victim of this attack wouldn't really know that this attack was happening unless they had some special alerts set for pending HTLCs. For Thunderhub users (a highly recommended tool), the home screen will show a chart of pending HTLCs as well as a warning stating that channels can only hold 483 pending HTLCs.

In practice, my node quickly became unreliable and experienced several app crashes, including Thunderhub, which was the only app to notify me of the problem. Then, thanks to my “Balance of Satoshis” Telegram bot, I got a channel closing notification. The channel under attack force-closed itself! That was not supposed to be part of the experiment. (For more technical information on the involuntary force close, see below for additional force-close data.)

## What Can The Victim Do To Stop A Griefing Attack?

Once an attack starts, a victim essentially can't do anything to stop it. The only alternatives available to halt an ongoing attack would be to force-close the channel being attacked, which means that the terrorists win.

To add insult to injury, force-closing the channel will push the unresolved payments to the on-chain transaction data, triggering secondary on-chain transactions for the initiator of the force close. At 50 sats/vbyte and 483 on-chain transactions, that’s easily a 1 million sat price tag to force close a single channel under attack (a $368 channel close fee at today's prices). The multiple on-chain transactions only occur if the output is above the minimum payment "dust" limit. (See [this example](https://mempool.space/testnet/tx/0be93eff334ecaebc5a2ff783373f96dbc0ef7b3df1a5daa37db96b419eb1305) on testnet.)

## How To Prevent A Griefing Attack

Jager has been working on a proof-of-concept program to help isolate and fight attackers. He's calling his program "[Circuitbreaker](https://github.com/lightningequipment/circuitbreaker)." The Circuitbreaker works at a network level, which unfortunately means that *everyone* has to participate for it to be effective.

Beyond that, this issue needs prioritization and attention from dedicated engineers/developers to find better solutions. There have also been some good discussions on modifying the protocol in the Bitcoin Optech newsletter (issue #122 or #126).

This attack can be executed today. It is a miracle that it hasn't already been used maliciously. It's a reflection of the incentives for those using Lightning today so that it can become an open, universal payment network. Please share this post as you see fit to encourage and inspire more work to fix this problem before it causes real harm.

## Additional Technical Information About The Involuntary Force-Close

Here are the logs from my node running LND 0.11 at the moment that the above mentioned involuntary force-close occured:

> 2020-11-26 21:24:47.374 [ERR] HSWC: ChannelLink(657759:561:0): failing link: ChannelPoint (c37bec006b18df172698a84739ca47128935e0a8666fecd1a843e49b01db207c:0): received error from peer: chan\_id=7c20db019be443a8d1ec6f66a8e035891247ca3947a8982617df186b00ec7bc3, err=rejected commitment: commit\_height=455, invalid\_commit\_sig=3044022076fd65191eb6305b723fa6012be378413b6326e2786c38db58b4c02e1f3999d202207605ca31de8b4c5b1d9cd20dc1581dfa2383e0b4e06c8ad4f718ab5c434d8cf5, commit\_tx=02000000017c20db019be443a8d1ec6f66a8e035891247ca3947a8982617df186b00ec7bc300000000008a792e8002210d0000000000002200201031cf10a1efef261edd3d0a1a6a953b27bc25bd7150bb2b07afdc69805e02157213000000000000160014de650929042bef58b71783ae1a44834a902a8f2d542ca720, sig\_hash=4e0fb804c74376020e4c44a60969b9206eb0aaa9a89b76017d60f23ad5cf63e5 with error: remote error

The logs show an "invalid\_commit\_sig" which is a known issue in LND. Supposedly, this can happen upon reconnecting and isn't a direct result of the channel jamming. The volume of pending HTLCs unfortunately makes it more likely to happen. Jager helped explain the process as channel jamming --> endless payment loop (bug) --> node down --> reconnect --> invalid commit sig (bug) --> channel force-close.

The "endless" loop bug is a known bug that occurs when the HTLC limit is reached and an additional HTLC is sent. Instead of ending in a payment failure, LND will continue to attempt the payment in a loop. To help with this bug, see [LND issue #4656](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/issues/4656).

# Dust Exposure Tool

## Building

* Requires Go 1.16
* Run the following command:

```
$ go build

```

## DustAcceptor mode

* The dust tool can intercept malicious `open_channel` requests with high `dust_limit_satoshis` values.
* Simply run it like so:

```
./dust-tool -network=<mainnet/testnet/etc> -macpath=<path-of-macaroon> -host=<host:port of RPC server>

```

* You should see output like this:

```
2021/09/30 18:06:47 Creating dust acceptor, no output will be recorded unless it errors out.

```

## Channel Close recommendations

* The dust tool can also give channel close recommendations based on a confirmed channel's `dust_limit_satoshis` and `max_accepted_htlcs` values.
* Simply run it like so, optionally specifying `-dustexposure` in satoshis:

```
./dust-tool -network=<mainnet/testnet/etc> -macpath=<path-of-macaroon> -host=<host:port of RPC server> -check-chans -dustexposure=1000000

```

* If a potentially risky channel is found, you should receive output like this:

```
2021/09/30 18:12:59 Evaluating set of channels for dust exposure
2021/09/30 18:12:59 Consider closing chanpoint(e2b43845a099c7ab98345a4604b24d7fbb4c19cec97911a9c1c250b57c762220:0), dust exposure(0.0483 BTC) higher than threshold(0.0049 BTC)

```

* If no output is returned, you are safe for the dust threshold specified!

## Help

```
Usage of ./dust-tool:
  -check-chans
        whether to check existing channels for dust_limit_satoshis exposure
  -dustexposure uint
        sets the dust threshold in satoshis for channel close recommendations - must be specified with checkchans (default 600000)
  -host string
        host of the target lnd node (default "localhost:10009")
  -macpath string
        path of admin.macaroon for the target lnd node (default "/path/admin.macaroon")
  -network string
        the network the lnd node is running on (default "mainnet")
  -tlspath string
        path to the TLS cert of the target lnd node (default "/path/tls.cert")

```

# Security Fixes

This release contains a security fix for [CVE-2021-41593](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41593) which would allow an attacker to cause loss of funds through a griefing vector related to high accepted dust values. This release addresses the issue by enforcing stricter clamps on accepted dust values during channel funding, and also adds `hltcswitch` level dust accounting to limit the total dust exposure (triggered by an instantaneous force close) at any moment. The default allotted fully forwarded dust exposure level is set at `500k sats`, this value can be tweaked with a new config flag: `--dust-threshold=`.

If upgrading is not possible to prevent [CVE-2021-41593](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gjfm-mwrf-wg3p "CVE-2021-41593"), the [`dust-tool`](https://github.com/lightninglabs/dust-tool) can intercept bad `open_channel` parameters and reject them via our `ChannelAcceptor`. In addition, it can also scan your node's current set of confirmed channels and recommend closing potentially risky ones out.

Alternatively, your node's advertised `min_htlc` value can be increased to ensure it is well above all the dust limits of its active channels.

# Database Migrations

This release does not contain any database migrations.

# Verifying the Release

In order to verify the release, you'll need to have `gpg` or `gpg2` installed on your system. Once you've obtained a copy (and hopefully verified that as well), you'll first need to import the keys that have signed this release if you haven't done so already:

```
curl https://keybase.io/bitconner/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import
curl https://keybase.io/roasbeef/pgp_keys.asc | gpg --import

```

Once you have the required PGP keys, you can verify the release (assuming `manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig` and `manifest-v0.13.3-beta.txt` are in the current directory) with:

```
gpg --verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig manifest-v0.13.3-beta.txt

```

You should see the following if the verification was successful:

```
gpg: Signature made Mon Oct  4 08:20:20 2021 PDT
gpg:                using RSA key 60A1FA7DA5BFF08BDCBBE7903BBD59E99B280306
gpg: Good signature from "Olaoluwa Osuntokun <laolu32@gmail.com>" [ultimate]

```

That will verify the signature of the manifest file, which ensures integrity and authenticity of the archive you've downloaded locally containing the binaries. Next, depending on your operating system, you should then re-compute the `sha256` hash of the archive with `shasum -a 256 <filename>`, compare it with the corresponding one in the manifest file, and ensure they match *exactly*.

## Verifying the Release Timestamp

From this new version onwards, in addition time-stamping the *git tag* with [OpenTimeStamps](https://opentimestamps.org/), we'll also now timestamp the manifest file along with its signature. Two new files are now included along with the rest of our release artifacts:  `manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.txt.asc.ots`.

Assuming you have the opentimestamps client installed locally, the timestamps can be verified with the following commands:

```
ots verify manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig.ots -f manifest-roasbeef-v0.13.3-beta.sig

```

Alternatively, [the open timestamps website](https://opentimestamps.org/) can be used to verify timestamps if one doesn't have a `bitcoind` instance accessible locally.

These timestamps should give users confidence in the integrity of this release even after the key that signed the release expires.

## Verifying the Release Binaries

Our release binaries are fully reproducible. Third parties are able to verify that the release binaries were produced properly without having to trust the release manager(s). See our [reproducible builds guide](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/tree/master/build/release) for how this can be achieved.

The release binaries are compiled with `go1.16.3`, which is required by verifiers to arrive at the same ones.

They include the following build tags: `autopilotrpc`, `signrpc`, `walletrpc`, `chainrpc`, `invoicesrpc`, `routerrpc`, `watchtowerrpc` and `monitoring`. Note that these are already included in the release script, so they do not need to be provided.

The `make release` command can be used to ensure one rebuilds with all the same flags used for the release. If one wishes to build for only a single platform, then `make release sys=<OS-ARCH> tag=<tag>` can be used.

Finally, you can also verify the *tag* itself with the following command:

```
$ git verify-tag v0.13.3-beta
gpg: Signature made Mo 04 Okt 2021 16:08:05 CEST
gpg:                using RSA key F4FC70F07310028424EFC20A8E4256593F177720
gpg: Good signature from "Oliver Gugger <gugger@gmail.com>" [unknown]

```
## Verifying the Docker Images

To verify the `lnd` and `lncli` binaries inside the docker images against the signed, reproducible release binaries, there is a verification script in the image that can be called (before starting the container for example):

```
$ docker run --rm --entrypoint="" lightninglabs/lnd:v0.13.3-beta /verify-install.sh v0.13.3-beta
$ OK=$?
$ if [ "$OK" -ne "0" ]; then echo "Verification failed!"; exit 1; done
$ docker run lightninglabs/lnd [command-line options]
```
# Building the Contained Release

Users are able to rebuild the target release themselves without having to fetch any of the dependencies. In order to do so, assuming

that `vendor.tar.gz` and `lnd-source-v0.13.3-beta.tar.gz` are in the current directory, follow these steps:

```
tar -xvzf vendor.tar.gz
tar -xvzf lnd-source-v0.13.3-beta.tar.gz
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags "-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.3-beta" ./cmd/lnd
GO111MODULE=on go install -v -mod=vendor -ldflags "-X github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/build.Commit=v0.13.3-beta" ./cmd/lncli

```

The `-mod=vendor` flag tells the `go build` command that it doesn't need to fetch the dependencies, and instead, they're all enclosed in the local vendor directory.

Additionally, it's now possible to use the [enclosed `release.sh` script to bundle a release for a *specific* system like so](https://github.com/lightningnetwork/lnd/pull/2191):

```
make release sys="linux-arm64 darwin-amd64"

```

Subject: [Lightning-dev] Miners Dust Inflation attacks on Lightning Network
Message-ID:
Lightning protocol supports a floating dust output selection at channel
creation, where each party declares a dust parameter applying to its local
transactions. The current spec doesn't enforce or recommend any bound on
this value, beyond the requirement of being lower that
`channel\_reserve\_satoshis`. When a HTLC is routed through the channel but
its value is under the local party dust limit, it's burned as fees and not
added to the commitment transaction. This rule, which makes LN a good
citizen of the Bitcoin blockchain comes at the price of more trust in your
counterparty..
Let's consider the following scenario. Mallory announces a channel to Alice
with dust-limit-satoshi set to 20% of channel value. Alice should accept
incoming channels as long as its under her implementation-specific
`max\_dust\_limit\_satoshis`. Now Mallory can route 4 dust-HTLCs to Mallet
through Alice claiming ~80% of channel value.
Mallory --> Alice --> Mallet
Mallet, in collusion with Mallory, can claim the whole set of HTLCs by
revealing the corresponding preimage for each. At the exact same time,
Mallory broadcast her latest commitment transaction on which there is \_no\_
HTLCs because all of them are dust. Alice can't claim them onchain but has
already paid Mallet forward.
At first-look, this attack doesn't seem economically rational because
dust-HTLCs are all committed as fees. But if you assume that Mallory can
collude with some mining pool, economics change completely because it's now
a almost zero-cost to add Mallory commitment transaction in a block,
hashrate won't be wasted. Fees are going back to the miner, and Alice is
still robbed. Mallory commitment transaction may stay in miner pool as long
block isn't found, without being announced to the rest of the network, and
HTLCs timelocks don't expire. Attack may still stealth if block isn't
signed. It's almost a zero-cost because if you assume block being full,
commitment transaction is now competing for block space and there is an
opportunity cost.
It's that kind of low-probability-and-hard-to-exploit-vulnerability but you
would prefer not having to think about your big LSP hub being targeted by a
rogue mining pool employee. Even if it's a really small mining pool, you
may batch the attack on multiple channels at once for one block found.
Deployment of Stratum V2 may make the attack easier by giving more leverage
to the local miner.
Mitigating may come by negotiating a new
`max\_dust\_htlc\_value\_in\_flight\_msat` enforced by HTLC recipient, therefore
expressing its maximum trust tolerance with regards to dust. Bearing a cost
on a HTLC holder will also render the attack more expensive, even if for
counter-measure efficiency you likely need a different order of magnitude
that spam-protection.
Cheers,
Antoine
