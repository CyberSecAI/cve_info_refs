# LiveQuery publishes user session tokens

High

[mtrezza](/mtrezza)
published
GHSA-7pr3-p5fm-8r9x
Sep 30, 2021

## Package

npm

parse-server
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 4.10.4

## Patched versions

4.10.4

## Description

### Impact

For regular (non-LiveQuery) queries, the session token is removed from the response, but for LiveQuery payloads it is currently not. If a user has a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups will be broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload.

### Patches

Remove session token from LiveQuery payload.

### Workaround

Set `user.acl(new Parse.ACL())` in a beforeSave trigger to make the user private already on sign-up.

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41109

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

We do not know when these tags have been pushed to the Parse Server repository, but we first became aware of this issue on July 21, 2021. We are not aware of any malicious code or concerns related to privacy, security or legality (e.g. proprietary code). However, it has been reported that some functionality does not work as expected and the introduction of security vulnerabilities cannot be ruled out. |
