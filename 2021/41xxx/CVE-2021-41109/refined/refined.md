Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the fact that `parse-server` did not strip out session tokens when using LiveQuery on `Parse.User` class. Specifically, when a user had a LiveQuery subscription on the `Parse.User` class, all session tokens created during user sign-ups were broadcast as part of the LiveQuery payload. This was in contrast to regular queries, where session tokens were correctly removed from the response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Sensitive Data:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of session tokens through LiveQuery. These tokens are essentially authentication credentials that could be misused if intercepted.
*   **Lack of Consistent Data Handling:** The inconsistency between regular queries and LiveQuery in handling session tokens highlights a flaw in the data sanitization process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Account Hijacking:** If an attacker intercepts a session token, they could potentially impersonate the user and gain unauthorized access to their account.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Depending on the user's permissions, a compromised session could allow the attacker to perform actions they are not normally authorized to do.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker could intercept network traffic to capture the LiveQuery payloads containing the session tokens.
*   **Compromised Subscriber:** An attacker could subscribe to LiveQuery and then receive all session tokens sent as part of the payloads, even for users they do not own the session of.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the client subscribing to LiveQuery and the parse-server instance.
*   **LiveQuery Subscription:** The attacker also needs to be able to subscribe to the LiveQuery.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix implemented in version 4.10.4 of `parse-server` involves stripping the session token from the LiveQuery payload.
*   A workaround was suggested involving setting the user ACL to private in a beforeSave trigger but this is not as complete of a fix as the actual patch.
*   The vulnerability is specific to when LiveQuery is used on the `Parse.User` class and `_Session` class.
*   The fix also included stripping the authData property from the payload in the same scenario.
*  The vulnerability has been assigned the GitHub Security Advisory ID [GHSA-7pr3-p5fm-8r9x](https://github.com/parse-community/parse-server/security/advisories/GHSA-7pr3-p5fm-8r9x).
