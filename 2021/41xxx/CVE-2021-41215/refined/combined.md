# Null pointer exception in `DeserializeSparse`

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-x3v8-c8qx-3j3r
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

The [shape inference code for `DeserializeSparse`](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/8d72537c6abf5a44103b57b9c2e22c14f5f49698/tensorflow/core/ops/sparse_ops.cc#L152-L168) can trigger a null pointer dereference:

```
import tensorflow as tf

dataset = tf.data.Dataset.range(3)

@tf.function
def test():
  y = tf.raw_ops.DeserializeSparse(
    serialized_sparse=tf.data.experimental.to_variant(dataset),
    dtype=tf.int32)

test()
```

This is because the shape inference function assumes that the `serialize_sparse` tensor is a tensor with positive rank (and having `3` as the last dimension). However, in the example above, the argument is a scalar (i.e., rank 0).

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [d3738dd70f1c9ceb547258cbb82d853da8771850](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/d3738dd70f1c9ceb547258cbb82d853da8771850).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41215

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
