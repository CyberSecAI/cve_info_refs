Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2021-41764**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The Streama application lacks CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection when performing actions like uploading local files.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability (CWE-352). Specifically, the application does not implement CSRF checks for the local file upload functionality.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can trick a logged-in administrator into uploading arbitrary local files, which can then be exfiltrated to the attacker. This could lead to exposure of sensitive information stored on the server (e.g., `/etc/passwd`).
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through a CSRF attack, where a malicious web page or email contains crafted requests that are unknowingly executed by the administrator's browser while they are logged into the vulnerable Streama application.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to trick a logged-in administrator of the Streama application into visiting a malicious webpage or email. The administrator must be logged into the Streama instance at the time the crafted request is triggered.

**Additional Details:**

*   The provided "Streama-Exploit.html" file demonstrates the CSRF attack. It uses JavaScript to make requests to the Streama server, first modifying the "Upload Directory" setting to `/var/www/html` and "Local Video Files" to `/etc`, then it adds the `/etc/passwd` file using the `addLocalFile.json` endpoint. Finally, the exploit fetches the content of the uploaded `/etc/passwd` file via the `/video/addLocalFile.json` endpoint.
*   The "Streama Vulnerability" gist explicitly states that all versions up to and including v1.10.3 are vulnerable to this CSRF vulnerability.
