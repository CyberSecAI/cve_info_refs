Prevent username with changed capitalization from taking over an existing username/password combination.

Root cause: jupyterhub lower-cases username, but firstuseauthenticator does not. So alternate capitalization of username gains access to, and creates a parallel path to user files (multiple capitalizations of username have access)

Sorry, something went wrong.

| Thanks! I've updated this to call the `normalize_username` method, which encapsulates whatever JupyterHub does to normalize a username. |

# Improper Access Control in jupyterhub-firstuseauthenticator

Critical

[consideRatio](/consideRatio)
published

Oct 28, 2021

## Package

jupyterhub
(helm)

## Affected versions

< 1.1.4

## Patched versions

1.1.4

pip

jupyterhub-firstuseauthenticator
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

< 1.0

(git repository)

< 2021-10-28 installations

0cdf03afd24db86382c457a0df5c7ff3a3823f6f

## Description

### Impact

When JupyterHub is used with FirstUseAuthenticator, the vulnerability allows unauthorized access to any user's account if `create_users=True` and the username is known or guessed.

### Patches

Upgrade to jupyterhub-firstuseauthenticator to 1.0, or apply patch <https://github.com/jupyterhub/firstuseauthenticator/pull/38.patch>

### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade, there is no complete workaround, but it can be mitigated.

If you cannot upgrade yet, you can disable user creation with `c.FirstUseAuthenticator.create_users = False`, which will only allow login with fully normalized usernames for already existing users prior to jupyterhub-firstuserauthenticator 1.0. If any users have never logged in with their normalized username (i.e. lowercase), they will still be vulnerable until you can patch or upgrade.

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41194

### Weaknesses

[CWE-284](/advisories?query=cwe%3A284)
