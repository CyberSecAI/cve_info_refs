{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Vyper compiler did not properly validate decimal inputs in external functions.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability allows for out-of-bounds inputs which may lead to unexpected behavior or errors. The exact impact isn't specified but could include incorrect calculations or crashes.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by providing out-of-bounds decimal arguments to external functions of a smart contract compiled with vulnerable versions of Vyper.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to call the affected external function of a smart contract with arbitrary decimal arguments."
  },
  "additional_details": "The issue was fixed by adding clampers to abi_decode in commit 1d7d488 which was part of the pull request 2447. Specifically, this ensures that any decimal inputs are within the allowed bounds before further processing."
