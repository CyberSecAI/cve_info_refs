Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of input sanitization in the `add_keyword.php` file, specifically the `k` parameter, which is used as an authorization key for external shares. This unsanitized input is directly passed into a SQL query in the `check_access_key_collection` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind boolean-based SQL injection, caused by the lack of sanitization of the `k` parameter before being used in the SQL query within the `check_access_key_collection` function.
*   **Insecure Cookie Handling:** The application relies on a cookie (`upload_share_active`) to determine the external share to access. The value of this cookie can be set to `1` to access any share, even if no external shares have been set up by the administrator.
*   **Insecure Session Management:**  User session cookies are stored within the database in the `session` column of the `user` table and can be extracted using the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Insecure Plugin Management:** Admin users can upload plugins containing arbitrary PHP files, leading to potential remote code execution. This is an insecure admin feature.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can gain RCE privileges by exploiting the SQL injection to extract an administrator's session cookie. Subsequently, they can log in as an admin and upload malicious plugins containing PHP code to achieve code execution on the server.
*   **Data Breach:** The SQL injection vulnerability allows the attacker to dump the entire contents of the ResourceSpace database, including usernames, password hashes, and session cookies.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The attacker can escalate privileges from unauthenticated user to admin user by stealing the session cookie.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** By achieving RCE, the attacker can gain full control over the server, leading to potential data theft, system manipulation, or further malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector is through a specifically crafted HTTP request to the `pages/edit_fields/9_ajax/add_keyword.php` file including a malicious `k` parameter.
*   **Web Browser:** After gaining admin access, the attacker uses a web browser to upload a malicious plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to trigger the SQL injection vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the ResourceSpace server.

**Additional Details (beyond CVE description):**

*   The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the "external upload shares" feature introduced in ResourceSpace 9.5.
*   The `upload_share_active` cookie can be manipulated to always use share `1` without the need to configure external shares
*   The vulnerable `add_keyword.php` file does not properly sanitize input, leading to SQL injection.
*   The attacker uses the SQL injection to gain admin access by retrieving the admin session cookie.
*   The attacker uses admin access to upload a malicious plugin to get RCE.
*   The vulnerability was found using an autonomous pentesting tool.
