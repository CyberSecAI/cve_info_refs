- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored XSS vulnerability in the system log related to authentication attempts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
    - Lack of HTTP-Only flag on the session cookie.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exfiltrate an administrator's session cookie.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker can inject malicious code into the system log, specifically in the authentication attempt logs. When an administrator views the logs, the injected script executes in the administrator's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to trigger an authentication attempt that can be logged and contain the malicious script.
