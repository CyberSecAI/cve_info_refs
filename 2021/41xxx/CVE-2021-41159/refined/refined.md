Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41159:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper client input validation when handling gateway connections. Specifically, the client does not properly validate data received from the gateway.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- Insufficient input validation, specifically for data received from a gateway during `/gt:rpc` connections.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious gateway can send crafted data to a vulnerable FreeRDP client, causing the client to write data out of bounds, potentially leading to memory corruption. This could allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious or compromised RDP gateway.
- The client must be configured to use the `/gt:rpc` gateway connection method.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must control or be able to manipulate the RDP gateway.
- The attacker does not need to be directly connected to the FreeRDP client.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects FreeRDP clients using gateway connections with the `/gt:rpc` option.
- The vulnerability is addressed in FreeRDP version 2.4.1.
- Workarounds include using `/gt:http` connections, or using a direct connection without gateway.
- The vulnerability was reported by Sunglin from the Knownsec 404 team & 0103 sec team.
