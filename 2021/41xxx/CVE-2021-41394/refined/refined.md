Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-41394:

**Root Cause:**
- A routine security audit of Teleport identified several vulnerabilities across versions 4.4, 5, 6, and 7.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Server Access:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** Incorrect validation of forged SSH host certificates.
    *   **Affected Components:** `tsh` (when used with an identity file) and Teleport agents.
    *   **Specific Code Paths:**
        *   `tsh` with identity files (service accounts).
        *   Teleport agents connecting to a malicious cluster.
2.  **Database Access:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** An attacker could manipulate the connection string by crafting database names or usernames when connecting to a Postgres database.
    *   **Impact:** Ability to probe connections to reachable database servers, alter connection parameters (e.g., disabling TLS, using password authentication).
3.  **Build Infrastructure:**
    *   **Vulnerability:** A vulnerability in Teleport build infrastructure could have been used to alter build artifacts.
    *   **Affected Versions:** Teleport 4.4, 5, 6, and 7.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Server Access:**
    *   **`tsh` with identity file:** Potential leakage of sensitive commands executed by the service account or control of the SSH agent in proxy recording mode.
    *   **Teleport agents:** Agents could connect to a malicious cluster. Although access to resources such as SSH, Kubernetes, Applications or database servers will still be rejected due to missing valid user certificates.
2.  **Database Access:**
    *   Potentially gain access to other database servers by probing.
    *   Ability to alter connection parameters, potentially disabling TLS or using weaker authentication.
3.  **Build Infrastructure:**
    *   Potentially alter build artifacts (no evidence of actual exploitation).

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Server Access:**
    *   **Network Position:** An attacker with a privileged network position could forge SSH host certificates.
2.  **Database Access:**
    *   Crafting malicious database names or usernames when connecting to a Postgres database.
3.  **Build Infrastructure:**
     *   Exploiting a vulnerability within Teleport's build infrastructure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Server Access:**
    *   Privileged network position to forge SSH host certificates.
2.  **Database Access:**
    *   Ability to interact with the Postgres database connection process to inject malicious names or parameters.
3. **Build Infrastructure:**
    *   Exploitation of this vulnerability would require specific knowledge of the build system.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes multiple release notes for Teleport versions 4.4.11, 5.2.4, 6.2.12 and 7.1.1
*   The releases were created to address the vulnerabilities described.
*   The severity of the impact of the build infrastructure vulnerability is uncertain, no evidence of exploitation was found.
*   The vulnerability also affects the ability to connect to OpenSSH nodes that present keys or certificates not signed by Teleport.
