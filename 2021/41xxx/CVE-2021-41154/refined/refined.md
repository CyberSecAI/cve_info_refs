Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41154:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is improper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing SQL queries used to browse and search commits in Subversion (SVN) repositories. Specifically, the `morder` GET parameter, used for ordering commit results, was not properly sanitized before being incorporated into the SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection (CWE-89). An attacker can inject malicious SQL code through the `morder` parameter.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The provided information also states that the fix addresses an XSS vulnerability via the same injection point. This suggests that the unsanitized input might also be reflected in the HTML output, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Query Execution:** An attacker with read access to an SVN repository could execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, potentially leading to data breaches, modification, or other malicious actions.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The XSS vulnerability would enable an attacker to inject client-side scripts into the web pages viewed by other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
- **HTTP GET Parameter:** The attack vector uses the `morder` GET parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Read Access to SVN Repository:** The attacker needs to have at least read access to an SVN repository to be able to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Tuleap instance.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `src/www/svn/svn_utils.php` file, specifically within the `svn_get_revisions` function.
- The `$morder` parameter is used to construct an SQL `ORDER BY` clause.
- The fix involves sanitizing user input before using it in the SQL query.

**More Detail Than CVE Description:**
- The provided content provides significantly more detail than a typical CVE description.
- It includes the specific files affected, code changes that were made, CVSS score, and how to exploit the vulnerability.
- It links to the commit that contains the fix.
- The content specifies the affected versions of Tuleap.
- The content also mentions that an XSS vulnerability was present at the same injection point.
