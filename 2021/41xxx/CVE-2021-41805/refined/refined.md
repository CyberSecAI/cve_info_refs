Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-41805:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authorization logic of HashiCorp Consul Enterprise. Specifically, an ACL token with the default `operator:write` permissions in one namespace could be used to escalate privileges, granting access to any other permissions across all namespaces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to escalate privileges beyond the intended scope of the `operator:write` permission.
- **Insufficient Authorization Logic:** The authorization logic in Consul Enterprise did not properly restrict the use of `operator:write` permissions, leading to the privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to:
- **Disclosure of sensitive information:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data within the Consul environment.
- **Addition or modification of data:** Ability to alter or add data, potentially leading to misconfigurations or other unauthorized actions.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Ability to disrupt the availability of services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the network API of Consul Enterprise.
- An attacker would need an ACL token with `operator:write` permissions in one namespace.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires a valid ACL token with `operator:write` permissions within at least one namespace in a vulnerable Consul Enterprise deployment.
- Network access to the Consul Enterprise API.

**Affected Versions:**
- HashiCorp Consul Enterprise versions prior to 1.8.17
- 1.9.x prior to 1.9.11
- 1.10.x prior to 1.10.4

**Note:**
NetApp products incorporate HashiCorp Consul Enterprise, but according to the NetApp advisory, none of their products are currently affected.
