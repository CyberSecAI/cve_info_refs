This vulnerability, CVE-2021-41805, was fixed in Consul Enterprise 1.8.17, 1.9.11, and 1.10.4.

**Background**

Consul Enterprise uses [namespaces](https://www.consul.io/docs/enterprise/namespaces) and the [ACL system](https://www.consul.io/docs/security/acl) for restricting access to resources such as services and nodes. The [operator ACL rule](https://www.consul.io/docs/security/acl/acl-rules#operator-rules) (such as `operator:read`) is used for cluster-level operations found in the [operator API](https://www.consul.io/api/operator), with the one exception being the [keyring API](https://www.consul.io/api-docs/operator/keyring).

**Details**

During internal testing, it was observed that an ACL token configured with default `operator:write` permissions may be used to escalate privileges into any other permissions across all namespaces.

Consul Enterprise’s authorization logic has been modified to prohibit this.

**Remediation**

Customers should evaluate the risk associated with this issue and consider upgrading to Consul Enterprise 1.10.4, 1.9.11, 1.8.17, or newer. Please refer to [Upgrading Consul](https://www.consul.io/docs/upgrading) for general guidance and version-specific upgrade notes.

**Acknowledgement**

This issue was identified by the Consul engineering team.
