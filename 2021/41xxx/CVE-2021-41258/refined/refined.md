Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41258:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The default snippet for the `image` block in Kirby CMS did not escape HTML special characters in the output of the `source`, `alt`, and `link` fields.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The lack of proper output escaping allows the injection of malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the site frontend or Panel session of other users. This can lead to:
- Privilege escalation by gaining access to the Panel session of an admin user.
-  JavaScript-powered attacks, depending on the website's functionality.
- Defacement of the website.
- Theft of sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with the ability to modify content using the Kirby CMS Panel. Specifically, they need to be able to insert an image block into a page or post. The malicious payload is injected into the source, alt or link field of the image block.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Must be an authenticated user of the Kirby Panel with content creation privileges.
- Ability to create or edit content using the image block.
- Knowledge of XSS payloads

**More details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of Kirby CMS between 3.5.0 and 3.5.7.1.
- The vulnerability was patched in version 3.5.8 by escaping special HTML characters in the output of the image block snippet.
- The vulnerability is triggered when the malicious content is displayed on the site frontend, not the Panel itself.
