Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41088:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper origin checking in the backend of Elvish's experimental web UI. This backend hosts an endpoint that executes code sent from the web UI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Origin Validation:** The web UI backend fails to properly validate the origin of requests, allowing cross-origin requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
- **Remote Code Execution:** The endpoint, designed for communication within the web UI, is vulnerable to arbitrary code injection due to the lack of origin validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine. This could lead to full system compromise, data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.
- **Compromised Machine:** If a user has the vulnerable web UI backend running and visits a malicious website, the attacker can remotely execute code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** An attacker can host a malicious website that sends a crafted request to the vulnerable endpoint on the user's localhost.
- **Cross-Origin Request:** The attack is facilitated by cross-origin requests due to the backend's failure to check the origin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the victim's machine, specifically targeting the localhost port where the web UI backend is running.
- **Victim running the vulnerable web UI:** The attacker relies on the victim having the web UI backend open while visiting the malicious website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The web UI is experimental.
- The vulnerable code has been removed from Elvish version 0.14.0 onwards, mitigating the vulnerability in the default builds.
- Users building Elvish from source can still include the vulnerable code.
- The advisory provides workarounds such as not using the experimental web UI and removing the web UI components.
