Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an inadequate brute-force protection mechanism in eLabFTW versions prior to 4.1.0. The application used the `PHPSESSID` cookie to track failed login attempts. Since this cookie is controlled by the user, an attacker could bypass the lockout by simply using different or no `PHPSESSID` values on each login attempt. This effectively reset the failed attempt counter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Brute-Force Protection:** The primary weakness was the reliance on a client-controlled session ID to track failed login attempts.
*   **Lack of IP or Device Tracking:** The system did not properly track login attempts based on IP address, device, or other identifying factors.
*   **Session Manipulation:** The `PHPSESSID` cookie, being user-controlled, allowed trivial manipulation to circumvent the attempt counter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Bypass of Account Lockout:** An attacker could bypass the intended lockout mechanism by submitting many login attempts without being blocked, thus making brute-force attacks possible.
*   **Potential Unauthorized Access:** Successful brute-force attacks could lead to unauthorized access to user accounts and the application itself.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate the `PHPSESSID` value in the HTTP `Cookie` header of login requests.
*   **Automated Attacks:** An attacker could easily automate this using tools like Burp Suite to send many login attempts with manipulated or missing `PHPSESSID` values.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the eLabFTW login page.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** Understanding how to manipulate HTTP headers, specifically cookies, is needed.
*   **Automated Attack Tools:** Tools like Burp Suite are necessary to automate the attack process.
*   **Valid User Email:** To perform brute-force attacks, the attacker needs to know the email address of the target account.
*   **Password Wordlists:** The attacker would need a password list to make multiple password guesses.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in eLabFTW versions prior to 4.1.0 and was fixed in version 4.1.0.
*   The fix implemented a "device cookie" based brute-force protection, as suggested by OWASP. This involves issuing a unique device cookie after a successful login, making it necessary to login from a trusted device to prevent brute-force attacks.
*   The commit `8e92afe` in the github content shows the code changes that implement the device token based anti brute-force login protection.
*   The exploit-db content details how the vulnerability can be exploited using Burp Suite Intruder, and also describes how to enumerate user accounts by examining password reset form behavior.
*   The advisory also notes that rate limiting at the network level is also a valid option.

In summary, the vulnerability allowed an attacker to bypass the login brute-force protection mechanism by manipulating the session cookie, making brute-force attacks feasible until the fix implemented a more robust device-based authentication system.
