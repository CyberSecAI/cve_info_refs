{
  "CVE-2021-41950": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `provider` and `variant` parameters in `pages/ajax/tiles.php` are not sanitized before being used to construct a directory path. If a file already exists at the directory path, it is deleted.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Path Traversal",
      "Arbitrary File Deletion"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An unauthenticated attacker can delete arbitrary files as the web server user. This includes application source code and configuration files, leading to a denial of service. Deleting `config.php` is especially impactful as it contains sensitive secret keys.",
    "Attack vectors": "By manipulating the `provider` and `variant` parameters in a request to `pages/ajax/tiles.php`, an attacker can specify the path to the file they wish to delete.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable endpoint."
