Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41368:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how Microsoft Access parses ACCDB database files. Specifically, the issue stems from the lack of validation for the existence of an object before performing operations on it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-After-Free: The vulnerability is a use-after-free, which occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has been freed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior or exploitation.
- Improper input validation: The parsing process does not properly check if an object exists before attempting to use it, leading to the use-after-free.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process (the user's Access application). This could lead to a complete compromise of the system if the user has sufficient privileges.
- Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process
- Confidentiality and Integrity impact: Successful exploitation can lead to full data breaches and modifications.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious ACCDB file: An attacker can craft a malicious ACCDB file that triggers the vulnerability when opened by a user.
- Malicious web page: An attacker can embed the exploit in a malicious web page that can exploit the vulnerability if a user views the page with an affected application.
- User interaction is required: The target user needs to open the malicious ACCDB file or visit the malicious web page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to create a malicious ACCDB database file or malicious webpage.
- Ability to deliver the malicious file or page to a target user.
- No special privileges required.

**Additional details:**
-  The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on 2021-07-28, and an update was released to correct the issue.
- The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 7.8.
- The vulnerability has a low attack complexity, no required privileges, and requires user interaction.
