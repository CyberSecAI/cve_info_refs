**Vulnerability:** CVE-2021-41445: Unauthenticated Reflected Cross-Site Scripting

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the web interface of the D-Link DIR-X1860 router.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The web interface is susceptible to injecting malicious scripts via crafted requests.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious script into the user's browser when accessing the vulnerable web interface. This could lead to session hijacking, information theft, or further manipulation of the user's router configuration.
*   **Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious URL containing a script that is then reflected back and executed within the user's browser. The user would need to be lured to click this malicious link or have it loaded into their browser via another attack.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability, so the attacker can be located anywhere on the internet, and needs to entice a victim to visit a crafted URL or similar method to trigger the XSS.

**Affected product:** D-Link DIR-X1860 hardware revision Ax, Firmware v1.03 and below.
**Fix:** Firmware v1.10WWB09_Beta addresses this vulnerability.
