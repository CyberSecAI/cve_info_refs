- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unsanitized user input is passed to the `unlink()` function in PHP, allowing an attacker to control the file path to be deleted.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Arbitrary file deletion. The application does not properly sanitize user input before using it in the `unlink()` function. The code compares user-provided values with previous or default values, but if the user alters the file path, it bypasses the check.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can delete arbitrary files on the server that the PHP process has permissions to access, including files in the web root. This could include deleting important application files and configurations, and potentially circumventing webserver security mechanisms by deleting `.htaccess` files.
- **Attack vectors:** HTTP requests to vulnerable URLs `/user/ppsave.php` and `/user/adv.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the vulnerable endpoints. The attacker must also identify the path of the file they wish to delete. The attacker needs to modify the request to include a malicious file path by manipulating the `img` or `oldimg` attributes in the HTML form.
