Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `SparseFillEmptyRows` implementation within TensorFlow. The code did not validate that the length of the `values` input tensor matched the number of index tuples in the `indices` input tensor.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap out-of-bounds (OOB) read/write: When the lengths of `values` and `indices` do not match, the code could access memory outside the allocated bounds, leading to a heap OOB read/write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The heap OOB access could lead to a crash or potentially allow for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific input to the `SparseFillEmptyRows` operation, where the number of elements in the `values` tensor does not match the number of index tuples in the `indices` tensor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute TensorFlow operations with crafted inputs. This typically requires the ability to control the input data for a TensorFlow model or operation.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided code example demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability:
```python
import tensorflow as tf

data=tf.raw_ops.SparseFillEmptyRows(
  indices=[[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]],
  values=['sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss'],
  dense_shape=[5,3],
  default_value='o')
```
- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a check to ensure that the length of `values` matches the first dimension of `indices`.
- The patch is available in commit `67bfd9feeecfb3c61d80f0e46d89c170fbee682b`.
- The fix is included in TensorFlow versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1, and will be included in 2.7.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.
