Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-41947

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `visual-mode.json` endpoint of the Subrion CMS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the `get` parameter when constructing a SQL query. Specifically, it is vulnerable to a UNION-based SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can potentially extract sensitive data from the database by injecting malicious SQL queries. This includes data such as usernames and passwords from the `sbr421_members` table.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Successful injection can lead to further exploitation, such as modifying or deleting data in the database, depending on the privileges of the database user used by the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the `get` parameter in a crafted HTTP request to the `/panel/visual-mode.json` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the vulnerable endpoint:** An attacker needs access to the `visual-mode.json` endpoint, which appears to be available to administrative users.
- **Understanding of SQL injection techniques:** An attacker needs a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft a malicious payload.
- **Admin Privileges:** The example provided uses an admin login, suggesting that this vulnerability is exploitable by authenticated administrators.

**Technical Details:**

The provided information includes a specific example of an exploit using the following payload injected into the `get` parameter:

```
access&type=blocks' UNION ALL SELECT username, password FROM sbr421_members -- -&object=landing_what_is_this&page=index
```

This injection uses `UNION ALL SELECT` to append results from `sbr421_members` table to legitimate query, revealing usernames and password.
