Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow in the `_sdsMakeRoomFor` function of Redis's string library (SDS). This function is responsible for allocating memory for strings.
*   The integer overflow occurs when calculating the new size for a string buffer, if the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter is set to a very large value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The core issue is an integer overflow during the calculation of the new length for a string, specifically `newlen = (len + addlen);`. A large `addlen`, combined with a large existing `len`, can cause `newlen` to wrap around to a small value.
*   **Heap-based Buffer Overflow:** The integer overflow leads to a heap-based buffer overflow. After the integer overflow occurs, the program calculates the necessary memory based on the smaller, wrapped-around value, causing a heap-based buffer overflow which can lead to memory corruption and potential code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Heap corruption can lead to crashes and denial of service.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** More critically, the heap overflow could potentially be exploited by an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution on the server.
*   **Data Modification/Disclosure:** The heap corruption can also potentially be used to alter or disclose sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Payloads/Commands:**  The vulnerability is triggered by specially crafted network payloads or Redis commands, that trigger an increase in allocated memory beyond what is intended.
*   **Configuration Parameter:** The `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration parameter needs to be manually set to a non-default, very large value to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Network Payloads/Commands:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Redis server to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Ability to Modify Configuration (in some attack scenarios):** While not strictly required in all scenarios (if an admin has already set this config), to trigger the vulnerability the attacker will often need the ability to influence or change the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration setting to a very large value. This could be achieved by compromising an account with permission to change this setting.
*   **Low Privilege:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a low privileged user who has been granted access to send commands to the redis server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.6, 6.0.16 and 5.0.14.
*   A workaround is to restrict the ability of unprivileged users to modify the `proto-max-bulk-len` configuration using Redis ACLs (Access Control Lists).
*   The vulnerability was reported by `yiyuaner`.

In summary, CVE-2021-41099 is a serious vulnerability caused by an integer overflow that leads to a heap-based buffer overflow in Redis. Attackers can potentially achieve remote code execution or cause denial of service by sending specially crafted commands and network payloads, specifically when a non-default, very large `proto-max-bulk-len` setting is in place.
