{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `Lcobucci\\JWT\\Signer\\Key\\LocalFileReference` class, designed to hold a reference to a key file, was incorrectly used by HMAC-based algorithms. Instead of loading the file's content, these algorithms were using the file path as the key for signing and verification.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect use of file path instead of file content as key for HMAC algorithms."
    ],
    "impact": "Tokens are issued and validated using the file path as the hashing key, instead of the actual key content, leading to incorrect signature generation and validation. This means that an attacker could potentially forge tokens if they are aware of the file path being used as key.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker knowing the file path can use it to forge valid tokens, since the file path itself is being used as the key instead of the file contents.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the file path that is being used as a key. No other specific attacker position or capabilities are mentioned."
