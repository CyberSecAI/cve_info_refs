A fast and easy to configure HTML Sanitizer written in Java which lets
you include HTML authored by third-parties in your web application while
protecting against XSS.

The existing dependency is on JSR 305. The other jars
are only needed by the test suite. The JSR 305 dependency is a
compile-only dependency, only needed for annotations.

This code was written with security best practices in mind, has an
extensive test suite, and has undergone
[adversarial security review](/OWASP/java-html-sanitizer/blob/main/docs/attack_review_ground_rules.md).

## Getting Started

[Getting Started](/OWASP/java-html-sanitizer/blob/main/docs/getting_started.md) includes instructions on
how to get started with or without Maven.

## Prepackaged Policies

You can use
[prepackaged policies](https://static.javadoc.io/com.googlecode.owasp-java-html-sanitizer/owasp-java-html-sanitizer/20240325.1/org/owasp/html/Sanitizers.html):

```
PolicyFactory policy = Sanitizers.FORMATTING.and(Sanitizers.LINKS);
String safeHTML = policy.sanitize(untrustedHTML);
```

## Crafting a policy

The
[tests](https://github.com/OWASP/java-html-sanitizer/blob/main/src/test/java/org/owasp/html/HtmlPolicyBuilderTest.java)
show how to configure your own
[policy](https://static.javadoc.io/com.googlecode.owasp-java-html-sanitizer/owasp-java-html-sanitizer/20240325.1/org/owasp/html/HtmlPolicyBuilder.html):

```
PolicyFactory policy = new HtmlPolicyBuilder()
    .allowElements("a")
    .allowUrlProtocols("https")
    .allowAttributes("href").onElements("a")
    .requireRelNofollowOnLinks()
    .toFactory();
String safeHTML = policy.sanitize(untrustedHTML);
```

## Custom Policies

You can write
[custom policies](https://static.javadoc.io/com.googlecode.owasp-java-html-sanitizer/owasp-java-html-sanitizer/20240325.1/org/owasp/html/ElementPolicy.html)
to do things like changing `h1`s to `div`s with a certain class:

```
PolicyFactory policy = new HtmlPolicyBuilder()
    .allowElements("p")
    .allowElements(
        (String elementName, List<String> attrs) -> {
          // Add a class attribute.
          attrs.add("class");
          attrs.add("header-" + elementName);
          // Return elementName to include, null to drop.
          return "div";
        }, "h1", "h2", "h3", "h4", "h5", "h6")
    .toFactory();
String safeHTML = policy.sanitize(untrustedHTML);
```

Please note that the elements "a", "font", "img", "input" and "span"
need to be explicitly whitelisted using the `allowWithoutAttributes()`
method if you want them to be allowed through the filter when these
elements do not include any attributes.

[Attribute policies](https://static.javadoc.io/com.googlecode.owasp-java-html-sanitizer/owasp-java-html-sanitizer/20240325.1/org/owasp/html/AttributePolicy.html) allow running custom code too. Adding an attribute policy will not water down any default policy like `style` or URL attribute checks.

```
new HtmlPolicyBuilder = new HtmlPolicyBuilder()
    .allowElement("div", "span")
    .allowAttributes("data-foo")
        .matching(
            (String elementName, String attributeName, String value) -> {
              // Return value for the attribute or null to drop.
            })
        .onElements("div", "span")
    .build()
```

## Preprocessors

Preprocessors allow inserting text and large scale structural changes.

```
new HtmlPolicyBuilder = new HtmlPolicyBuilder()
    // Use a preprocessor to be backwards compatible with the
    // <plaintext> element which
    .withPreprocessor(
        (HtmlStreamEventReceiver r) -> {
          // Provide user with info about links before they click.
          // Before:                       <a href="https://example.com/...">
          // After:  (https://example.com) <a href="https://example.com/...">
          return new HtmlStreamEventReceiverWrapper(r) {
            @Override public void openTag(String elementName, List<String> attrs) {
              if ("a".equals(elementName)) {
                for (int i = 0, n = attrs.size(); i < n; i += 2) {
                  if ("href".equals(attrs.get(i)) {
                    String url = attrs.get(i + 1);
                    String origin;
                    try {
                      URI uri = new URI(url);
                      String scheme = uri.getScheme();
                      String authority = uri.getRawAuthority();
                      if (scheme == null && authority == null) {
                        origin = null;
                      } else {
                        origin = (scheme != null ? scheme + ":" : "")
                               + (authority != null ? "//" + authority : "");
                      }
                    } catch (URISyntaxException ex) {
                      origin = "about:invalid";
                    }
                    if (origin != null) {
                      text(" (" + origin + ") ");
                    }
                  }
                }
              }
              super.openTag(elementName, attrs);
            }
          };
        }
    .allowElement("a")
    ...
    .build()
```

Preprocessing happens before a policy is applied, so cannot affect the security
of the output.

## Telemetry

When a policy rejects an element or attribute it notifies an [HtmlChangeListener](https://static.javadoc.io/com.googlecode.owasp-java-html-sanitizer/owasp-java-html-sanitizer/20240325.1/org/owasp/html/HtmlChangeListener.html).

You can use this to keep track of policy violation trends and find out when someone
is making an effort to breach your security.

```
PolicyFactory myPolicyFactory = ...;
// If you need to associate reports with some context, you can do so.
MyContextClass myContext = ...;

String sanitizedHtml = myPolicyFactory.sanitize(
    unsanitizedHtml,
    new HtmlChangeListener<MyContextClass>() {
      @Override
      public void discardedTag(MyContextClass context, String elementName) {
        // ...
      }
      @Override
      public void discardedAttributes(
          MyContextClass context, String elementName, String... attributeNames) {
        // ...
      }
    },
    myContext);
```

**Note**: If a string sanitizes with no change notifications, it is not the case
that the input string is necessarily safe to use. Only use the output of the sanitizer.

The sanitizer ensures that the output is in a sub-set of HTML that commonly
used HTML parsers will agree on the meaning of, but the absence of
notifications does not mean that the input is in such a sub-set,
only that it does not contain elements or attributes that were removed.

See ["Why sanitize when you can validate"](https://github.com/OWASP/java-html-sanitizer/blob/main/docs/html-validation.md) for more on this topic.

### October 2021

The latest releases of Alfresco products alfresco-content-services and Share User Interface contains fixes of three security vulnerabilities, two of them have been reported by external security researchers, see the credits below.

The first issue reported was an evasion in the XSS prevention filter used to validate HTML input coming from the client's browser. The XSS prevention filter have been replaced with the specialized library from OWASP: Java HTML Sanitizer <https://github.com/OWASP/java-html-sanitizer/> likely preventing other possible future evasions being discovered. This issue was assigned provisional number CVE-2021-41791 Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Affected versions include:

* org.alfresco:share - versions from (including) 5.0.x.x up to (including) 5.2.7.11
* org.alfresco:share - versions from (including) 6.0.x.x up to (including) 6.2.2.4
* org.alfresco:community-share - prior to (including) 7.0
* org.alfresco:share - versions from (including) 6.1.x.x up to (including) 6.1.1.2
* org.alfresco:share -versions from (including) 6.0.x.x up to (including) 6.0.1.2
* org.alfresco:share - versions 7.0.1 , 7.0.0.2 , 7.0.0.1 , 7.0

The second issue fixed was in the business logic around script execution. Additional validation was implemented preventing edge cases that could lead to an escalation of privileges in the sanboxed script execution itself. This issue was assigned provisional number CVE-2021-41790. Affected versions include:

* org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services - versions from (including) 5.0.x.x up to (including) 5.2.7.11
* org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services - versions from (including) 6.0.0.x up to (including) 6.0.1.9
* org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services - versions from (including) 6.1.0.x up to (including) 6.1.1.10
* org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services - versions from (including) 6.2.0.x up to (including) 6.2.2.18
* org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services - versions 7.0.0.2 , 7.0.0.1 , 7.0
* org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services - versions from (including) 7.0.1.0 up to (including) 7.0.1.2

The third issue fixed is a Blind SSRF that could be executed through a specific document format transformation. The issue has been fixed by disabling the specific tranformation through configuration. This issue was assigned provisional number CVE-2021-41792. Affected versions include:

* org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services - versions from (including) 5.0.x.x up to (including) 5.2.7.11
* org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services - versions from (including) 6.0.0.x up to (including) 6.0.1.9
* org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services - versions from (including) 6.1.0.x up to (including) 6.1.1.10
* org.alfresco:alfresco-content-services - versions from (including) 6.2.0.x up to (including) 6.2.2.18
* org.alfresco:alfresco-transform-services - prior to (including) 1.3

Credits:

For CVE-2021-41790 and CVE-2021-41791 we want to thank Jack Misiura and Stefano Lanaro at The Missing Link Australia for reporting them and to professionally collaborate in the controlled disclosure. All the above issues were discovered during security testing and so far we do not have any evidence that they have ever been attempted to be exploited in a production environment.
