Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-41771:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds slice operation within the `ImportedSymbols` function of the `debug/macho` package in Go. This occurs when parsing malformed Mach-O binaries (a file format for executables, object code, shared libraries, etc., used in macOS and other Apple OSes).

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The `ImportedSymbols` function attempts to access memory beyond the allocated buffer when processing a malformed dynamic symbol table command, specifically when the encoded number of undefined symbols exceeds the actual number of symbols present in the symbol table.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a panic in the Go application, causing a denial of service. The application will crash when processing a malicious Mach-O file.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Mach-O Binary:** An attacker can craft a malformed Mach-O binary with an invalid dynamic symbol table command that triggers the out-of-bounds access. This malicious file would need to be processed by the vulnerable `debug/macho` package.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply the malicious Mach-O binary to a Go application that uses the vulnerable `debug/macho` package to parse it. There is not any specific requirement about the attacker position relative to the vulnerable application.

**Additional Notes from the Content:**

*   The vulnerability affects Go versions before 1.16.10 and 1.17.x before 1.17.3.
*   The vulnerability is identified as CVE-2021-41771 and tracked as Go issue [golang.org/issue/48990](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48990).
*   Patches have been released to address this vulnerability in Go 1.16.10, 1.17.3, and later versions.
*   Several Linux distributions (Debian, Fedora) also released updates with patches.
*   Some products from other vendors (e.g., Siemens, NetApp) are also affected by this vulnerability.
