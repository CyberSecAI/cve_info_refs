# Release History

This page summarizes the changes between official stable releases of Go.
The [change log](/change) has the full details.

To update to a specific release, use:

```

git fetch --tags

## Release Policy

Each major Go release is supported until there are two newer major releases.
For example, Go 1.5 was supported until the Go 1.7 release, and Go 1.6 was
supported until the Go 1.8 release.
We fix critical problems, including [critical security problems](/security),
in supported releases as needed by issuing minor revisions
(for example, Go 1.6.1, Go 1.6.2, and so on).

Hi gophers,

We have just released Go versions 1.17.3 and 1.16.10, minor point releases.

These minor releases include two security fixes following the [security policy](https://golang.org/security):

* archive/zip: don't panic on (\*Reader).Open

Reader.Open (the API implementing io/fs.FS introduced in Go 1.16) can be made to panic by an attacker providing either a crafted ZIP archive containing completely invalid names or an empty filename argument.

Thank you to Colin Arnott, SiteHost and Noah Santschi-Cooney, Sourcegraph Code Intelligence Team for reporting this issue.

This is CVE-2021-41772 and Go issue [golang.org/issue/48085](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48085).

* debug/macho: invalid dynamic symbol table command can cause panic

Malformed binaries parsed using Open or OpenFat can cause a panic when calling ImportedSymbols, due to an out-of-bounds slice operation.

Thanks to Burak Çarıkçı - Yunus Yıldırım (CT-Zer0 Crypttech) for reporting this issue

This is CVE-2021-41771 and Go issue [golang.org/issue/48990](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48990).

View the release notes for more information:

    <https://golang.org/doc/devel/release.html#go1.17.minor>

You can download binary and source distributions from the Go web site:

    <https://golang.org/dl/>

To compile from source using a Git clone, update to the release with

"git checkout go1.17.3" and build as usual.

Thanks to everyone who contributed to the releases.

Cheers,

Than and Dmitri for the Go team

                 CVE-2021-44716 CVE-2021-44717
Debian Bug     : 989492 991961

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Go programming
language. An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) and
information leak.

CVE-2021-33196

    In archive/zip, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can
    cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.

CVE-2021-36221

    Go has a race condition that can lead to a net/http/httputil
    ReverseProxy panic upon an ErrAbortHandler abort.

CVE-2021-39293

    Follow-up fix to CVE-2021-33196

CVE-2021-41771

    ImportedSymbols in debug/macho (for Open or OpenFat) accesses a
    Memory Location After the End of a Buffer, aka an out-of-bounds
    slice situation.

CVE-2021-44716

    net/http allows uncontrolled memory consumption in the header
    canonicalization cache via HTTP/2 requests.

CVE-2021-44717

    Go on UNIX allows write operations to an unintended file or
    unintended network connection as a consequence of erroneous
    closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.8.1-1+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.8 packages.

For the detailed security status of golang-1.8 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-1.8>

# Go: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202208-02**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in Go, the worst of which could result in remote code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-lang/go** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.18.5** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.18.5** |

### Background

Go is an open source programming language that makes it easy to build simple, reliable, and efficient software.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in Go. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Go users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-lang/go-1.18.5"

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals. Additional information on Industrial Security by

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Brownﬁeld Connectivity – Gateway collects data from the conﬁgured clients and forwards the data to
other connected systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

                 CVE-2021-44716 CVE-2021-44717
Debian Bug     : 989492 991961

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in the Go programming
language. An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS) and
information leak.

CVE-2021-33196

    In archive/zip, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can
    cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.

CVE-2021-36221

    Go has a race condition that can lead to a net/http/httputil
    ReverseProxy panic upon an ErrAbortHandler abort.

CVE-2021-39293

    Follow-up fix to CVE-2021-33196

CVE-2021-41771

    ImportedSymbols in debug/macho (for Open or OpenFat) accesses a
    Memory Location After the End of a Buffer, aka an out-of-bounds
    slice situation.

CVE-2021-44716

    net/http allows uncontrolled memory consumption in the header
    canonicalization cache via HTTP/2 requests.

CVE-2021-44717

    Go on UNIX allows write operations to an unintended file or
    unintended network connection as a consequence of erroneous
    closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.7.4-2+deb9u4.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.7 packages.

For the detailed security status of golang-1.7 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-1.7>

## Description

![@rolandshoemaker](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/5080674?u=c9a1ba53e27929b8d12ab031c053f540a9693db3&v=4&size=48)[rolandshoemaker](https://github.com/rolandshoemaker)opened [on Oct 14, 2021](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/48990#issue-1026771260)

Calling `File.ImportedSymbols` on a loaded file which contains an invalid dynamic symbol table command can cause a panic, in particular if the encoded number of undefined symbols is larger than the number of symbols in the symbol table.

                 CVE-2022-23806 CVE-2022-24921
Debian Bug     : 989492 991961

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in the Go programming
language. An attacker could trigger a denial-of-service (DoS), invalid
cryptographic computation, information leak, or arbitrary code
execution on the developer's computer in specific situations.

CVE-2020-28367

    Code injection in the go command with cgo allows arbitrary code
    execution at build time via malicious gcc flags specified via a
    #cgo directive.

CVE-2021-33196

    In archive/zip, a crafted file count (in an archive's header) can
    cause a NewReader or OpenReader panic.

CVE-2021-36221

    Go has a race condition that can lead to a net/http/httputil
    ReverseProxy panic upon an ErrAbortHandler abort.

CVE-2021-38297

    Go has a Buffer Overflow via large arguments in a function
    invocation from a WASM module, when GOARCH=wasm GOOS=js is used.

CVE-2021-39293

    This issue exists because of an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-33196.

CVE-2021-41771

    ImportedSymbols in debug/macho (for Open or OpenFat) Accesses a
    Memory Location After the End of a Buffer, aka an out-of-bounds
    slice situation.

CVE-2021-44716

    net/http allows uncontrolled memory consumption in the header
    canonicalization cache via HTTP/2 requests.

CVE-2021-44717

    Go on UNIX allows write operations to an unintended file or
    unintended network connection as a consequence of erroneous
    closing of file descriptor 0 after file-descriptor exhaustion.

CVE-2022-23806

    Curve.IsOnCurve in crypto/elliptic can incorrectly return true in
    situations with a big.Int value that is not a valid field element.

CVE-2022-24921

    regexp.Compile allows stack exhaustion via a deeply nested
    expression.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
1.11.6-1+deb10u6.

We recommend that you upgrade your golang-1.11 packages.

For the detailed security status of golang-1.11 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/golang-1.11>

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
