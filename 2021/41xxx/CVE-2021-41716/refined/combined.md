**Vulnerable Software:** Maharashtra State Electricity Board Android Application

**Vulnerability:**Account takeover via OTP Fixation

**Affected Version:** 7.50 and prior

**Patched:** Yes

**Vendor Homepage:** https://www.mahadiscom.in/en/home/

**CVE:** CVE-2021-41716

**CVE Author:** Tejas Nitin Pingulkar

**Exploit Available:** [POC Available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd9b1ouF__A)

**About Affected Software**

The Official App for Consumer by Mahavitaran (MSEDCL). Mahavitaran Consumer App enables consumers to avail Mahavitaran services at his/her fingertips. The app is simple and easy to use. It provides transparency in delivering services to consumers.

►Features :

\*View and Pay bill

\*View Bill and Payment history

\*Manage Multiple Electricity Connections

\*Contact 24 x7 MSEDCL Call Center

\*Apply for New Connection

\* Know the status of New Connection Application and Pay Estimate Charges

\*Estimate your monthly electricity consumption and bill amount

\*Get Information about the Feeder from where the power supply is provided to your connection

\*Apply for the change of name

\*Submit an application for addition/reduction in load

**Exploit**

Authentication bypass using OTP Fixation

OTP reset functions use the id field

An attacker can manipulate the OTP ID field as each OTP id has a fixed OTP code.

Let’s generate OTP for a password reset.

Now as demonstrated in Video POC below OTP ID is 7310828, and Correct OTP for this id is 565449

Now we know that for OTP ID 7310828 Correct OTP is 565449; hence we can use the same OTP ID and OTP pair to reset any user account and take full control.

**Proof Of Concept**

December 27, 2024The app crashes when trying to login. Get unable to connect error while trying to complaint. Also one cannot complaint about power failure if there even one month bill overdue; this is as if mseb would be providing the services for free that month and as if we will never pay the bill! Pathetic app and overall service!2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXR6aEhEgEf3QqKFtkt_DSqw5ZNfFQAg3ZqnJ8dIMZ8b4kZEHSP=s32-rw)Gaurav Gulati*more\_vert*

December 27, 2024The app crashes when trying to login. Get unable to connect error while trying to complaint. Also one cannot complaint about power failure if there even one month bill overdue; this is as if mseb would be providing the services for free that month and as if we will never pay the bill!

December 27, 2024The app crashes when trying to login. Get unable to connect error while trying to complaint. Also one cannot complaint about power failure if there even one month bill overdue; this is as if mseb would be providing the services for free that month and as if we will never pay the bill! Pathetic app and overall service!2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXR6aEhEgEf3QqKFtkt_DSqw5ZNfFQAg3ZqnJ8dIMZ8b4kZEHSP=s32-rw)Gaurav Gulati*more\_vert*

| inveniosoftware — invenio-drafts-resources | Invenio-Drafts-Resources is a submission/deposit module for Invenio, a software framework for research data management. Invenio-Drafts-Resources prior to versions 0.13.7 and 0.14.6 does not properly check permissions when a record is published. The vulnerability is exploitable in a default installation of InvenioRDM. An authenticated a user is able via REST API calls to publish draft records of other users if they know the record identifier and the draft validates (e.g. all require fields filled out). An attacker is not able to modify the data in the record, and thus e.g. \*cannot\* change a record from restricted to public. The problem is patched in Invenio-Drafts-Resources v0.13.7 and 0.14.6, which is part of InvenioRDM v6.0.1 and InvenioRDM v7.0 respectively. | 2021-12-06 | [4](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2021-43781&vector=AV:N/AC:L/Au:S/C:P/I:N/A:N "CVSS V2 Score") | [CVE-2021-43781](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-43781)[MISC](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-drafts-resources/commit/039b0cff1ad4b952000f4d8c3a93f347108b6626)[CONFIRM](https://github.com/inveniosoftware/invenio-drafts-resources/security/advisories/GHSA-xr38-w74q-r8jv) |

| laravel — framework | Laravel is a web application framework. Laravel prior to versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 contain a possible cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the Blade templating engine. A broken HTML element may be clicked and the user taken to another location in their browser due to XSS. This is due to the user being able to guess the parent placeholder SHA-1 hash by trying common names of sections. If the parent template contains an exploitable HTML structure an XSS vulnerability can be exposed. This vulnerability has been patched in versions 8.75.0, 7.30.6, and 6.20.42 by determining the parent placeholder at runtime and using a random hash that is unique to each request. | 2021-12-08 | [4.3](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2021-43808&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:N/C:N/I:P/A:N "CVSS V2 Score") | [CVE-2021-43808](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-43808)[MISC](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v6.20.42)[MISC](https://github.com/laravel/framework/commit/b8174169b1807f36de1837751599e2828ceddb9b)[MISC](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39909)[MISC](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39908)[CONFIRM](https://github.com/laravel/framework/security/advisories/GHSA-66hf-2p6w-jqfw)[MISC](https://github.com/laravel/framework/pull/39906)[MISC](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v7.30.6)[MISC](https://github.com/laravel/framework/releases/tag/v8.75.0) |
| linuxfoundation — runc | runc is a CLI tool for spawning and running containers on Linux according to the OCI specification. In runc, netlink is used internally as a serialization system for specifying the relevant container configuration to the `C` portion of the code (responsible for the based namespace setup of containers). In all versions of runc prior to 1.0.3, the encoder did not handle the possibility of an integer overflow in the 16-bit length field for the byte array attribute type, meaning that a large enough malicious byte array attribute could result in the length overflowing and the attribute contents being parsed as netlink messages for container configuration. This vulnerability requires the attacker to have some control over the configuration of the container and would allow the attacker to bypass the namespace restrictions of the container by simply adding their own netlink payload which disables all namespaces. The main users impacted are those who allow untrusted images with untrusted configurations to run on their machines (such as with shared cloud infrastructure). runc version 1.0.3 contains a fix for this bug. As a workaround, one may try disallowing untrusted namespace paths from your container. It should be noted that untrusted namespace paths would allow the attacker to disable namespace protections entirely even in the absence of this bug. | 2021-12-06 | [6](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2021-43784&vector=AV:N/AC:M/Au:S/C:P/I:P/A:P "CVSS V2 Score") | [CVE-2021-43784](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-43784)[MISC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/d72d057ba794164c3cce9451a00b72a78b25e1ae)[MISC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/9c444070ec7bb83995dbc0185da68284da71c554)[MISC](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/f50369af4b571e358f20b139eea52d612eb55eed)[CONFIRM](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-v95c-p5hm-xq8f)[MISC](https://bugs.chromium.org/p/project-zero/issues/detail?id=2241)[MLIST](https://lists.debian.org/debian-lts-announce/2021/12/msg00005.html) |

| nebulab — solidus | Solidus is a free, open-source ecommerce platform built on Rails. Versions of Solidus prior to 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have a denial of service vulnerability that could be exploited during a guest checkout. The regular expression used to validate a guest order’s email was subject to exponential backtracking through a fragment like `a.a.` Versions 3.1.4, 3.0.4, and 2.11.13 have been patched to use a different regular expression. The maintainers added a check for email addresses that are no longer valid that will print information about any affected orders that exist. If a prompt upgrade is not an option, a workaround is available.

| requarks — wiki.js | Wiki.js is a wiki app built on Node.js. Prior to version 2.5.254, directory traversal outside of Wiki.js context is possible when a storage module with local asset cache fetching is enabled on a Windows host. A malicious user can potentially read any file on the file system by crafting a special URL that allows for directory traversal. This is only possible on a Wiki.js server running on Windows, when a storage module implementing local asset cache (e.g Local File System or Git) is enabled and that no web application firewall solution (e.g. cloudflare) strips potentially malicious URLs. Commit number 414033de9dff66a327e3f3243234852f468a9d85 fixes this vulnerability by sanitizing the path before it is passed on to the storage module. The sanitization step removes any windows directory traversal sequences from the path.

| xen — xen | grant table v2 status pages may remain accessible after de-allocation (take two) Guest get permitted access to certain Xen-owned pages of memory. The majority of such pages remain allocated / associated with a guest for its entire lifetime. Grant table v2 status pages, however, get de-allocated when a guest switched (back) from v2 to v1. The freeing of such pages requires that the hypervisor know where in the guest these pages were mapped. The hypervisor tracks only one use within guest space, but racing requests from the guest to insert mappings of these pages may result in any of them to become mapped in multiple locations. Upon switching back from v2 to v1, the guest would then retain access to a page that was freed and perhaps re-used for other purposes. This bug was fortuitously fixed by code cleanup in Xen 4.14, and backported to security-supported Xen branches as a prerequisite of the fix for XSA-378. | 2021-12-07 | [6.9](https://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?version=2&name=CVE-2021-28703&vector=AV:L/AC:M/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C "CVSS V2 Score") | [CVE-2021-28703](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-28703)[MISC](https://xenbits.xenproject.org/xsa/advisory-387.txt) |

| apache — log4j2 | Apache Log4j2 <=2.14.1 JNDI features used in configuration, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints. An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled. From log4j 2.15.0, this behavior has been disabled by default. In previous releases (>2.10) this behavior can be mitigated by setting system property “log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups” to “true” or by removing the JndiLookup class from the classpath (example: zip -q -d log4j-core-\*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class). Java 8u121 (see https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/8u121-relnotes.html) protects against remote code execution by defaulting “com.sun.jndi.rmi.object.trustURLCodebase” and “com.sun.jndi.cosnaming.object.trustURLCodebase” to “false”. | 2021-12-10 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-44228)[MISC](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html)[MLIST](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/10/1)[MLIST](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/10/2)[MISC](http://packetstormsecurity.com/files/165225/Apache-Log4j2-2.14.1-Remote-Code-Execution.html)[CONFIRM](https://security.netapp.com/advisory/ntap-20211210-0007/)[CISCO](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd)[MLIST](http://www.openwall.com/lists/oss-security/2021/12/10/3)[CONFIRM](https://psirt.global.sonicwall.com/vuln-detail/SNWLID-2021-0032)[CONFIRM](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html) |

| defensify — devise\_masquerade\_gem | The devise\_masquerade gem before 1.3 allows certain attacks when a password’s salt is unknown. An application that uses this gem to let administrators masquerade/impersonate users loses one layer of security protection compared to a situation where Devise (without this extension) is used. If the server-side secret\_key\_base value became publicly known (for instance if it is committed to a public repository by mistake), there are still other protections in place that prevent an attacker from impersonating any user on the site. When masquerading is not used in a plain Devise application, one must know the password salt of the target user if one wants to encrypt and sign a valid session cookie. When devise\_masquerade is used, however, an attacker can decide which user the “back” action will go back to without knowing that user’s password salt and simply knowing the user ID, by manipulating the session cookie and pretending that a user is already masqueraded by an administrator. | 2021-12-07 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-28680](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-28680)[MISC](https://github.com/oivoodoo/devise_masquerade/issues/83)[MISC](https://labanskoller.se/blog/2021/03/23/the-devise-extension-that-peeled-off-one-layer-of-the-security-onion-cve-2021-28680/) |

| ether — etherpad | Etherpad is a real-time collaborative editor. In versions prior to 1.8.16, an attacker can craft an `\*.etherpad` file that, when imported, might allow the attacker to gain admin privileges for the Etherpad instance. This, in turn, can be used to install a malicious Etherpad plugin that can execute arbitrary code (including system commands). To gain privileges, the attacker must be able to trigger deletion of `express-session` state or wait for old `express-session` state to be cleaned up. Core Etherpad does not delete any `express-session` state, so the only known attacks require either a plugin that can delete session state or a custom cleanup process (such as a cron job that deletes old `sessionstorage:\*` records). The problem has been fixed in version 1.8.16. If users cannot upgrade to 1.8.16 or install patches manually, several workarounds are available. Users may configure their reverse proxies to reject requests to `/p/\*/import`, which will block all imports, not just `\*.etherpad` imports; limit all users to read-only access; and/or prevent the reuse of `express\_sid` cookie values that refer to deleted express-session state.

| grafana — grafana | Grafana Agent is a telemetry collector for sending metrics, logs, and trace data to the opinionated Grafana observability stack. Prior to versions 0.20.1 and 0.21.2, inline secrets defined within a metrics instance config are exposed in plaintext over two endpoints: metrics instance configs defined in the base YAML file are exposed at `/-/config` and metrics instance configs defined for the scraping service are exposed at `/agent/api/v1/configs/:key`. Inline secrets will be exposed to anyone being able to reach these endpoints. If HTTPS with client authentication is not configured, these endpoints are accessible to unauthenticated users. Secrets found in these sections are used for delivering metrics to a Prometheus Remote Write system, authenticating against a system for discovering Prometheus targets, and authenticating against a system for collecting metrics. This does not apply for non-inlined secrets, such as `\*\_file` based secrets. This issue is patched in Grafana Agent versions 0.20.1 and 0.21.2. A few workarounds are available. Users who cannot upgrade should use non-inline secrets where possible. Users may also desire to restrict API access to Grafana Agent with some combination of restricting the network interfaces Grafana Agent listens on through `http\_listen\_address` in the `server` block, configuring Grafana Agent to use HTTPS with client authentication, and/or using firewall rules to restrict external access to Grafana Agent’s API. | 2021-12-08 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-41090](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-41090)[MISC](https://github.com/grafana/agent/commit/af7fb01e31fe2d389e5f1c36b399ddc46b412b21)[MISC](https://github.com/grafana/agent/pull/1152)[MISC](https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/tag/v0.21.2)[CONFIRM](https://github.com/grafana/agent/security/advisories/GHSA-9c4x-5hgq-q3wh)[MISC](https://github.com/grafana/agent/releases/tag/v0.20.1) |

| rubygems — rubygems | `Bundler` is a package for managing application dependencies in Ruby. In `bundler` versions before 2.2.33, when working with untrusted and apparently harmless `Gemfile`’s, it is not expected that they lead to execution of external code, unless that’s explicit in the ruby code inside the `Gemfile` itself. However, if the `Gemfile` includes `gem` entries that use the `git` option with invalid, but seemingly harmless, values with a leading dash, this can be false. To handle dependencies that come from a Git repository instead of a registry, Bundler uses various commands, such as `git clone`. These commands are being constructed using user input (e.g. the repository URL). When building the commands, Bundler versions before 2.2.33 correctly avoid Command Injection vulnerabilities by passing an array of arguments instead of a command string. However, there is the possibility that a user input starts with a dash (`-`) and is therefore treated as an optional argument instead of a positional one. This can lead to Code Execution because some of the commands have options that can be leveraged to run arbitrary executables. Since this value comes from the `Gemfile` file, it can contain any character, including a leading dash. To exploit this vulnerability, an attacker has to craft a directory containing a `Gemfile` file that declares a dependency that is located in a Git repository. This dependency has to have a Git URL in the form of `-u./payload`. This URL will be used to construct a Git clone command but will be interpreted as the upload-pack argument. Then this directory needs to be shared with the victim, who then needs to run a command that evaluates the Gemfile, such as `bundle lock`, inside. This vulnerability can lead to Arbitrary Code Execution, which could potentially lead to the takeover of the system. However, the exploitability is very low, because it requires a lot of user interaction. Bundler 2.2.33 has patched this problem by inserting `–` as an argument before any positional arguments to those Git commands that were affected by this issue. Regardless of whether users can upgrade or not, they should review any untrustred `Gemfile`’s before running any `bundler` commands that may read them, since they can contain arbitrary ruby code. | 2021-12-08 | not yet calculated | [CVE-2021-43809](https://nvd.nist.gov/nvd.cfm?cvename=CVE-2021-43809)[MISC](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/a4f2f8ac17e6ce81c689527a8b6f14381060d95f)[CONFIRM](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/security/advisories/GHSA-fj7f-vq84-fh43)[MISC](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/pull/5142)[MISC](https://github.com/rubygems/rubygems/commit/0fad1ccfe9dd7a3c5b82c1496df3c2b4842870d3) |

December 27, 2024The app crashes when trying to login. Get unable to connect error while trying to complaint. Also one cannot complaint about power failure if there even one month bill overdue; this is as if mseb would be providing the services for free that month and as if we will never pay the bill! Pathetic app and overall service!2 people found this review helpfulDid you find this helpful?YesNo![](https://play-lh.googleusercontent.com/a-/ALV-UjXR6aEhEgEf3QqKFtkt_DSqw5ZNfFQAg3ZqnJ8dIMZ8b4kZEHSP=s32-rw)Gaurav Gulati*more\_vert*

**Vulnerable Software:** Maharashtra State Electricity Board Android Application

**Vulnerability:**Account takeover via OTP Fixation

**Affected Version:** 7.50 and prior

**Patched:** Yes

**Vendor Homepage:** https://www.mahadiscom.in/en/home/

**App store link:** https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.msedcl.app&hl=en\_IN&gl=US

**CVE:** CVE-2021-41716

**CVE Author:** Tejas Nitin Pingulkar

**Exploit Available:** [POC Available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jd9b1ouF__A)

**About Affected Software**

The Official App for Consumer by Mahavitaran (MSEDCL). Mahavitaran Consumer App enables consumers to avail Mahavitaran services at his/her fingertips. The app is simple and easy to use. It provides transparency in delivering services to consumers.

►Features :

\*View and Pay bill

\*Register and Track complaints

\*View Bill and Payment history

\*Manage Multiple Electricity Connections

\*Contact 24 x7 MSEDCL Call Center

\*Apply for New Connection

\* Know the status of New Connection Application and Pay Estimate Charges

\*Submit Meter Reading to avoid average billing

\*Provide Feedback about Mahavitaran Services

\*Update Contact Details ( Mobile Number & E-mail ID ) of consumer

\*Find MSEDCL offices and collection centers near you

\*Estimate your monthly electricity consumption and bill amount

\*Get Information about the Feeder from where the power supply is provided to your connection

\*Apply for the change of name

\*Submit an application for addition/reduction in load

**Exploit**

Authentication bypass using OTP Fixation

OTP reset functions use the id field

An attacker can manipulate the OTP ID field as each OTP id has a fixed OTP code.

Let’s generate OTP for a password reset.

Now as demonstrated in Video POC below OTP ID is 7310828, and Correct OTP for this id is 565449

Now we know that for OTP ID 7310828 Correct OTP is 565449; hence we can use the same OTP ID and OTP pair to reset any user account and take full control.

**Proof Of Concept**

### Caution! Ignore Fake/Fraud SMS.

Do not respond to SMS / Calls / WhatsApp messages from unknown sources.

MSEDCL does not ask you to contact any person

MSEDCL sends SMS from the SENDER IDs like **VM-MSEDCL / VK-MSEDCL / AM-MSEDCL / JM-MSEDCL** etc. and not from any personal mobile number.

(The first 2 letters in a sender ID indicates the operator & location from where the message is being sent and it ends with MSEDCL.)

Do not share your Mobile or Desktop Screens or OTP received to you, in any case while online payments.

A consumer can lodge a complaint / FIR to the nearest Cyber police station or register a complaint online at the National Cyber Crime Portal **[“https://cybercrime.gov.in”](https://cybercrime.gov.in)**

For additional information / queries, consumers may call on any of the official toll free numbers **1912 / 19120 / 1800-212-3435 / 1800-233-3435.**
