{
  "cveId": "CVE-2021-41716",
  "vulnerability": {
    "rootCause": "The application's OTP reset function uses the id field without proper validation, allowing an attacker to manipulate it and reuse a fixed OTP code associated with that ID.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "OTP Fixation",
       "Authentication bypass"
    ],
    "impact": "Account takeover, full control of the user account.",
    "attackVectors": [
      "Manipulating the OTP ID field in the password reset function."
    ],
    "requiredCapabilities": "An attacker must be able to generate an OTP, capture the associated OTP ID, and the corresponding OTP value, then replay this combination for other user accounts.",
    "additionalDetails": "The application did not invalidate previously generated OTP codes. Every OTP ID had a corresponding, static, correct OTP code. The attacker can use an OTP ID and its corresponding OTP code to reset any user account."
  }
}
