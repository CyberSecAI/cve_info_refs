## Description

![@DNXie](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/24580222?u=1099f14e707eff0398b4878b0fe5def0af59d337&v=4&size=48)[DNXie](https://github.com/DNXie)opened [on Feb 4, 2021](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/46914#issue-800926370)

**System information**

* Have I written custom code (as opposed to using a stock example script provided in TensorFlow): No
* OS Platform and Distribution (e.g., Linux Ubuntu 16.04): Linux Ubuntu 18.04
* Mobile device (e.g. iPhone 8, Pixel 2, Samsung Galaxy) if the issue happens on mobile device: N/A
* TensorFlow installed from (source or binary): binary
* TensorFlow version (use command below):2.1.0
* Python version:3.7.6
* Bazel version (if compiling from source):N/A
* GCC/Compiler version (if compiling from source):N/A
* CUDA/cuDNN version:N/A
* GPU model and memory:N/A

**Describe the current behavior**

`tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D` crashes(aborts) when `size` is large

**Describe the expected behavior**

expect an exception message if the input unexpected instead of crash.

**Standalone code to reproduce the issue**

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np
tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D(size=1610637938, data_format='channels_first', interpolation='bilinear')(np.ones((5,1,1,1)))
```

Output:

```
2021-02-04 04:44:48.936606: F tensorflow/core/framework/tensor_shape.cc:353] Check failed: 0 <= new_num_elements (0 vs. -5475971237085092396)

# Overflow/crash in `tf.image.resize` when size is large

Low

[mihaimaruseac](/mihaimaruseac)
published
GHSA-5hx2-qx8j-qjqm
Nov 4, 2021

## Package

pip

tensorflow, tensorflow-cpu, tensorflow-gpu
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 2.7.0

## Patched versions

2.4.4, 2.5.2, 2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

If `tf.image.resize` is called with a large input argument then the TensorFlow process will crash due to a `CHECK`-failure caused by an overflow.

```
import tensorflow as tf
import numpy as np

tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D(
  size=1610637938,
  data_format='channels_first',
  interpolation='bilinear')(np.ones((5,1,1,1)))
```

The number of elements in the output tensor is too much for the `int64_t` type and the overflow is detected via a `CHECK` statement. This aborts the process.

### Patches

We have patched the issue in GitHub commit [e5272d4204ff5b46136a1ef1204fc00597e21837](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/commit/e5272d4204ff5b46136a1ef1204fc00597e21837) (merging [#51497](https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/pull/51497)).

The fix will be included in TensorFlow 2.7.0. We will also cherrypick this commit on TensorFlow 2.6.1, TensorFlow 2.5.2, and TensorFlow 2.4.4, as these are also affected and still in supported range.
