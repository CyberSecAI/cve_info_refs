Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41199:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from an integer overflow within the `tf.image.resize` function (specifically `tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D` which uses this). When processing a large `size` input parameter, the calculation of the output tensor's element count results in an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow: The code fails to properly handle or validate very large input parameters for resizing. Specifically, a large size parameter can lead to an integer overflow when calculating the output tensor's dimensions.
- Lack of proper error handling: Instead of throwing a controlled exception, an overflow triggers a `CHECK` failure leading to a program crash (abort).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploitation leads to the crashing of the TensorFlow process, causing a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by calling `tf.image.resize` or `tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D` with a crafted large `size` parameter, which causes integer overflow when calculating the output tensor size.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to control the input parameters to `tf.image.resize` or `tf.keras.layers.UpSampling2D`, specifically the `size` parameter. This could be achieved through various means depending on the context of the application.
- No specific privileges are needed, the attacker only needs the ability to provide input to the function.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in TensorFlow versions prior to 2.7.0.
- Patches have been applied to versions 2.4.4, 2.5.2, and 2.6.1.
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `ValidateAndCreateOutput` function of `image_resizer_state.h`. The fix involves using `TensorShape::AddDimWithStatus` which returns a proper status when there is an overflow.
- A test case was also added to `image_ops_test.py` to catch this specific issue.
