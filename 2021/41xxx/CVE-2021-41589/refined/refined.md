Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-41589:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the default open configuration of the Gradle Enterprise build cache node, which allows anonymous access to both the configuration user interface and the build cache itself. This means that by default, there are no access controls in place.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   **Unrestricted Access to Build Cache:**  The build cache allows anonymous write access, enabling anyone with network access to populate it with manipulated entries.
*   **Unrestricted Access to Configuration UI:** The configuration user interface allows anonymous access, enabling unauthorized modification of settings, including build cache access control.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** A malicious actor can populate the build cache with manipulated entries containing malicious code. When a build process uses the cache, this malicious code can be executed.
*   **Undoing Access Control:**  An attacker can modify the configuration via the UI to remove existing access control settings, then populate the cache with malicious entries, leading to remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is network access to the build cache node.
*   **Direct Manipulation:** Attackers directly interact with the vulnerable services to populate the cache or alter configurations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Gradle Enterprise build cache node.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is needed to exploit the default configuration, as access is anonymous.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects Gradle Enterprise build cache node versions prior to 10.0 and Gradle Enterprise versions prior to 2021.3.
*   The fix involves disabling access to the build cache by default and restricting access to the configuration user interface.
*   Existing installations must be manually updated to restrict access to mitigate the risk.
