Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30521:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap buffer overflow in the Autofill component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap buffer overflow: This occurs when data is written past the allocated buffer in the heap memory, potentially overwriting adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is the potential for arbitrary code execution, which could allow an attacker to gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves the Autofill component in the Chromium browser, meaning that exploitation would require interaction with the browser's autofill functionality.
- The specific method to trigger this overflow is not detailed in the provided context, but it involves how the Autofill feature handles data.
- A remote attacker could potentially exploit this through a crafted website or malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to cause the vulnerable code in the Autofill component to be executed, typically by the user loading a malicious website or interacting with crafted content.
- The attacker would likely need to have knowledge of the specific conditions and input required to trigger the heap overflow.

**Additional Notes:**
