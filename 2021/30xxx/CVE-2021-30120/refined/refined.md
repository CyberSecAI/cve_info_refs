Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-30120:

**CVE-2021-30120: 2FA bypass in Kaseya VSA <= v9.5.6**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the fact that the 2FA requirement is enforced on the client-side rather than server-side.
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** The application relies on client-side checks for 2FA enforcement. This means the client (user's browser) decides whether to prompt for the second authentication factor based on flags received from the server.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who has a valid username and password can bypass the 2FA requirement and gain unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack involves intercepting the server's response during the login process using a proxy (like Burp Suite). The attacker modifies the response by changing the "MFARequired" flag from `True` to `False`, thereby preventing the 2FA prompt from appearing, and gaining access.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must possess a valid username and password and be able to intercept and modify web traffic between the user's browser and the Kaseya VSA server, typically by using a proxy.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content offers more detail than the CVE description, which simply states "Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows attackers to bypass the 2FA requirement."
*   The vulnerability is fixed in Kaseya VSA versions greater than 9.5.6, specifically with the release of version 9.5.7.
*   The vulnerability is part of a series of vulnerabilities discovered by the DIVD and disclosed to Kaseya, as described in their blog post.
