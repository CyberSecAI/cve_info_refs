Based on the provided data, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30890:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A logic issue within WebKit's state management.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Logic error in the handling of web content.
- Lack of proper state management during the processing of web content.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Universal cross-site scripting (UXSS)**: An attacker can execute malicious scripts in the context of another website, bypassing the same-origin policy. This could allow the attacker to steal sensitive information (e.g., cookies, session tokens), perform actions on behalf of the victim user, or deface the target website.
