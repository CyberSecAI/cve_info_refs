Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30503:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the GLSL Linting extension for Visual Studio Code allowing the `glslangValidatorPath` setting to be configured at the workspace level. This allowed a malicious actor to specify a path to an arbitrary executable, which would then be executed by the extension, leading to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The extension lacked proper access control by allowing a user-controlled setting (`glslangValidatorPath`) to specify an executable, and executing it, which should have been restricted to a trusted configuration or machine scope.
- **Remote Code Execution:** By exploiting the above weakness, arbitrary code could be executed on the victim's machine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Workspace Configuration:** The attack vector involves a malicious user crafting a workspace configuration containing a malicious path for the `glslangValidatorPath` setting.
- **Opening Malicious Workspace:** A victim would need to open a workspace containing the malicious configuration in Visual Studio Code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a Visual Studio Code workspace configuration.
- The attacker needs to be able to convince a victim to open this workspace.
- The attacker does not need to have access to the victim's machine before the attack is executed.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.4.0 of the GLSL Linting extension by setting the scope of `glslangValidatorPath` to `machine`, preventing it from being overridden by a workspace configuration.
- The affected versions are prior to 1.4.0 including 1.3.0.
