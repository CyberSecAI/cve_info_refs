Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30463:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability lies in the `v-add-web-domain` shell script, which is called by `/add/web/index.php`. This script creates directories and sets permissions for new web domains. The script fails to check if directories already exist or have content, and uses `chmod` on a directory provided by the user without any validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to create symlinks within a domain directory which point to files and directories outside of the user's web directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Insecure directory creation and permission setting:** The `v-add-web-domain` script uses user-controlled input `$domain` to create directories and change their permissions using `chmod` without proper validation.
2.  **Symlink vulnerability:** The vulnerability enables a malicious user to create symlinks in their web directory to sensitive files or directories outside of their permitted scope.
3.  **Missing input sanitization:** The script does not validate or sanitize the input from the user, which allows for the creation of arbitrary symlinks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An authenticated user can:

1.  **Escalate privileges from user to admin:** By creating symlinks to the admin user's configuration file (`user.conf`), an attacker can read the admin's RKEY. With the RKEY, the attacker can reset the admin password and gain admin access. This is the primary exploit described.
2.  **Read arbitrary files:** An attacker can create symlinks to any file on the server and read its contents.
3.  **Escalate privileges from admin to root:** After gaining admin access, an attacker can use the fact that admins can run certain scripts as root with sudo without a password. By manipulating the `VESTA` environment variable before executing these scripts they can execute their own code with root privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered by using the web interface at `/add/web` to create a domain with symlinks in the directory structure.
2.  **Command Injection (indirect):** Though not direct command injection, the vulnerability is triggered by manipulating the permissions of arbitrary files by using a crafted file structure.
3. **Environment Variable Manipulation:** Using the admin account, an attacker manipulates the `VESTA` environment variable before executing sudo-allowed scripts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs an existing user account on the VestaCP panel.
2.  **Access to Web Interface:** The attacker needs to be able to access the VestaCP web interface to create a web domain.
3.  **(For Root)** Access to an admin account or the ability to escalate privileges to an admin account.
