{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the use of unescaped messages within HTML on ChangesList pages in MediaWiki. Specifically, the labels for rcfilters were being added to the DOM using append, while the messages themselves were unescaped plain text. This allowed for the injection of malicious HTML, resulting in XSS.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper output encoding"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker could inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript into the page, leading to the execution of malicious scripts in the victim's browser. This could allow the attacker to steal cookies, hijack user sessions, or perform other malicious actions within the context of the vulnerable MediaWiki site.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The vulnerability is triggered when a user with the ability to edit MediaWiki messages adds a malicious script to one of the rcfilters-filter-\*-label messages, such as MediaWiki:Rcfilters-filter-humans-label.",
      "Visiting Special:RecentChanges or Special:Watchlist (or other ChangesList pages) will then cause the injected script to be executed."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires administrative privileges to edit MediaWiki messages.",
      "position": "The attacker must be able to modify MediaWiki system messages"
  }
