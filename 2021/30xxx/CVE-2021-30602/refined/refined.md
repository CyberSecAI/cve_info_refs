      "description": "A use after free vulnerability exists in the WebRTC functionality of Google Chrome 91.0.4472.114 (Stable) and 93.0.4575.0 (Canary). A specially-crafted web page can trigger reuse of previously freed memory which can lead to arbitrary code execution. Victim would need to visit a malicious website to trigger this vulnerability.",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Chrome handles Interactive Connection Establishment (ICE) candidates during a WebRTC session setup. When setting up a WebRTC session, the `AddIceCandidate` function is used to add ICE candidates, received from the remote peer, to the browser's ICE agent. The vulnerability occurs when garbage collection is triggered before an ICE candidate is fully processed, marking memory used by a Promise for collection.  Subsequently, the execution of `AddIceCandidate` attempts to access the freed memory, causing a use-after-free condition.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Use after free"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.",
      "attack_vector": "Visiting a specially crafted malicious website.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and host a malicious webpage.  The attacker needs to manipulate a Promise to trigger garbage collection and a use after free.",
        "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be triggered by forcing garbage collection in between the execution of promise and `AddIceCandidate`. The `setLocalDescription` function is used to mark the parts of the memory to be collected by garbage collector."
