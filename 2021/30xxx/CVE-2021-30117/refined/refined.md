Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30117:

**CVE-2021-30117**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the `fldrId` parameter of the `/InstallTab/exportFldr.asp` API endpoint. This allows for SQL injection.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Authenticated Blind SQL Injection:** The `fldrId` parameter is vulnerable to boolean-based blind SQL injection.
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to extract sensitive data from the database, potentially including user credentials, configuration information, and other critical data.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is accessed via a GET request to the `/InstallTab/exportFldr.asp` endpoint.
    *   The attacker injects malicious SQL code into the `fldrId` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be at least semi-authenticated, possessing a valid `sessionId` cookie which can be obtained through a separate vulnerability (CVE-2021-30116)
    *   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Kaseya VSA server.
*   **Additional Details:**
    *   The vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection, where the attacker infers the truth of a condition based on the server's response (HTTP 200 or 500).

**Summary of related CVEs mentioned in the content:**

*   **CVE-2021-30116:** Unauthenticated credential leak and business logic flaw. An attacker can obtain valid session cookies by using leaked credentials.
*   **CVE-2021-30118:** Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution via arbitrary file upload.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided text highlights that DIVD (Dutch Institute for Vulnerability Disclosure) discovered the vulnerability and responsibly disclosed it to Kaseya.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was included in Kaseya VSA version 9.5.6.
