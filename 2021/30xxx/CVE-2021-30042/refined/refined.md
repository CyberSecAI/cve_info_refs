Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30042:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the "New Clinic" form of the RemoteClinic application. Specifically, the "Clinic Name", "Clinic Address", "Clinic City", and "Clinic Contact" fields do not filter out malicious scripts or HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript or HTML injected into the vulnerable fields is stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected clinic profile page. This is a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers who have permissions to view the vulnerable clinic profile page.
- **Account Compromise:** The attacker may potentially steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information by using malicious javascript which could lead to account compromise.
- **Data Manipulation:** Attackers might be able to perform actions on behalf of the victim, like modify data on the page or send data to an external server.
- **Phishing Attacks:** The attacker could potentially use injected JavaScript to redirect users to a malicious website or display fake login forms.
- **Defacement:** The attacker can alter the visual appearance of the web page using injected HTML content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attacker uses the web application interface to access the "New Clinic" creation form after logging in as a doctor.
- **Form Injection:** The attacker injects a malicious payload (JavaScript or HTML code) into the vulnerable input fields during the "New Clinic" creation process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid account with the role of a doctor in the RemoteClinic application to access the "New Clinic" functionality.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable fields within the clinic creation form and the affected clinic profile page URL (`/clinics/profile.php?id={Clinic ID}`).
- **Ability to Submit Form:** The attacker needs to be able to submit the form containing the malicious payload.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability exists in version 2.0 of the RemoteClinic application.
- The vulnerable endpoint is `/clinics/profile.php?id={Clinic ID}`.
- The exploit has been published on Exploit-DB as exploit 49795
