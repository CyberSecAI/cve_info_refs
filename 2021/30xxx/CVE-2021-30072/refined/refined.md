**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is due to a misuse of the `strcat` function in the `prog.cgi` file of the firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

A stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to the improper usage of `strcat`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

An attacker can cause the `prog.cgi` process to crash, leading to device malfunction.

**Attack vectors:**

The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a malicious request to the target device from the LAN-side.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

The attacker must be on the same LAN as the vulnerable device, and no authentication is needed.
