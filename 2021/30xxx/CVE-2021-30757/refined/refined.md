- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists because the iMovie application did not have hardened runtime enabled.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary weakness is the lack of hardened runtime in the iMovie application. This allowed a malicious application to potentially utilize the entitlements and privacy permissions granted to iMovie.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious application could potentially leverage the entitlements and privacy permissions granted to the vulnerable iMovie application.
- **Attack vectors:** A malicious application would be the attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to install and execute a malicious application on the target system.
