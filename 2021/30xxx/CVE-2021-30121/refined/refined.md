      "Local File Inclusion"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can read any file on the server that the webserver process has access to.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending a specially crafted request to the `/KLC/js/Kaseya.SB.JS/js.aspx` endpoint, an attacker can specify the path to a file on the server and have its content returned in the response.",
    "required_capabilities": "A valid session ID is needed to exploit the vulnerability. This can be obtained via other vulnerabilities such as CVE-2021-30118. Therefore, the attacker needs to either be an authenticated user or exploit another vulnerability to get a valid session ID."
