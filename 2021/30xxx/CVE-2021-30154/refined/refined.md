    "CVE-2021-30154": {
      "description": "The provided content contains information related to CVE-2021-30154. The vulnerability is described as an XSS issue within MediaWiki due to unescaped messages used in HTML on the Special:NewFiles page. This is confirmed by multiple sources including the Fedora update notification, Debian security advisory, and the MediaWiki release notes.",
      "vulnerability_details": {
        "root_cause": "The root cause is the use of unescaped messages (`mediastatistics-header-*`) within HTML output on the Special:NewFiles page. The form options are using the `->text()` output format which is not escaped, instead of the `options-messages` which would properly escape the output.",
        "weaknesses": "The weakness is the lack of proper sanitization/escaping of user-controlled data (specifically, MediaWiki messages) before rendering them as HTML.",
        "impact": "The impact of exploitation is Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code by modifying MediaWiki messages, which will then be executed in the browsers of users who visit the Special:NewFiles page.",
        "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through the modification of MediaWiki messages (`mediastatistics-header-*`). An attacker needs to have permissions to edit these messages (typically admin/sysop level permissions).",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have administrative or sysop level privileges to edit MediaWiki system messages. The attack is client-side, meaning the malicious script is executed within the user's browser when they visit the Special:NewFiles page."
      },
    "additional_notes": "The content also indicates the fix involves escaping the messages using `->escaped()` instead of `->text()`. The vulnerability is classified as relatively low risk because it requires admin-level access to modify the MediaWiki messages. The fix was backported to MediaWiki versions 1.31.13 and 1.35.2."
