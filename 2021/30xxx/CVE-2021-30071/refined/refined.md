Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-30071:

**Verification:**

The commit message "Fix XSS issue in list\_key.html" indicates this commit addresses a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which is a common type of security issue. This is likely a fix for a vulnerability that could be associated with the CVE.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the direct output of the `$data[$key]['ID']` variable within the `list_key.html` template. This variable was not properly sanitized before being rendered in the HTML, allowing for the injection of malicious HTML or JavaScript code.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is a **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability. The lack of input sanitization on the `$data[$key]['ID']` variable allows an attacker to inject malicious script through this field.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Data theft.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Defacing the web page.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by injecting malicious script into the `ID` field within the `$data` array. The exact mechanism of injecting this would depend on how the `ID` field is populated.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to influence the `$data` array such that the `ID` field contains malicious input. This likely requires the attacker to be an authorized user (but with compromised data).

**Technical Details:**

```

The fix involves replacing the direct output `<?=$data[$key]['ID'];?>` with `<?=htmlspecialchars($data[$key]['ID']);?>`.  The `htmlspecialchars()` function encodes special characters, preventing them from being interpreted as HTML tags and effectively mitigating the XSS vulnerability.

This change effectively addresses the stored/reflected XSS vulnerability by ensuring that any HTML characters entered into the ID field are rendered as plain text.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides more technical detail than a typical CVE description, illustrating the precise location and mechanism of the fix.

**Summary:**

The provided content clearly relates to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the `list_key.html` template within the Hestia Control Panel. The fix involves sanitizing the output of the ID field using the `htmlspecialchars()` function. The vulnerability is classified as a stored/reflected XSS.
