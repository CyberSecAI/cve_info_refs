| Hi,  While fuzzing samurai 1.2 (and git nightly repo), I found a NULL pointer dereference in the printstatus() function, in build.c.  ``` 262 static void 263 printstatus(struct edge *e, struct string *cmd) 264 { 265         struct string *description; 266         char status[256]; 267  268         description = buildopts.verbose ? NULL : edgevar(e, "description", true); 269         if (!description || description->n == 0) 270                 description = cmd; 271         formatstatus(status, sizeof(status)); 272         fputs(status, stdout); 273         puts(description->s); 274 }   ```  In the code snippet, it seems there are no checks on `cmd` parameter which leads to set the variable `description` to `NULL` on L270 and then on L273 it dereferences the NULL  Attaching a reproducer (gzipped so GitHub accepts it): [test1.gz](https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai/files/6250743/test1.gz)  Issue can be reproduced by running:  `samu -f test1`  ``` ================================================================= ==2291724==ERROR: AddressSanitizer: SEGV on unknown address 0x000000000008 (pc 0x7fa51cd50675 bp 0x7ffdf10454f0 sp 0x7ffdf1044ca8 T0) ==2291724==The signal is caused by a READ memory access. ==2291724==Hint: address points to the zero page.     #0 0x7fa51cd50675  (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x18b675)     #1 0x4355d1 in puts (/src/samurai/samu+0x4355d1)     #2 0x4cb75f in printstatus /src/samurai-1.2/build.c:273:2     #3 0x4cc1f1 in jobstart /src/samurai-1.2/build.c:312:3     #4 0x4ca7c7 in build /src/samurai-1.2/build.c:568:19     #5 0x4dc5aa in main /src/samurai-1.2/samu.c:256:2     #6 0x7fa51cbec0b2 in __libc_start_main (/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu/libc.so.6+0x270b2)     #7 0x41c42d in _start (/src/samurai/samu+0x41c42d)  AddressSanitizer can not provide additional info.

| Thanks for the report! This is something that should've been caught during parsing, but it only checked whether there was any `command = ...` line, even if the value was NULL. ninja errors on both missing on empty command value, so now we do the same. |

This matches ninja behavior and prevents the possibility of a rule
with an empty (NULL) command string.

Fixes [#68](https://github.com/michaelforney/samurai/issues/68).
