The provided content is related to CVE-2021-30139.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanity checks performed by `apk` on tar entries. The code assumes that fields like `uname`, `gname`, `linkname`, `magic`, and `name` within tar entries are null-terminated strings, as per the GNU Tar format specification. However, the code uses string functions like `strlen()` on these fields without verifying the presence of null terminators, which can lead to out-of-bounds reads if the fields are not properly null-terminated.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability due to the lack of null-termination checks in tar entry fields.
- The vulnerability is present before signature verification.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can craft a malicious apk package with tar entries lacking null-termination in string fields and cause the `apk` tool to perform out-of-bounds reads which can cause crashes.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious attacker can craft a specially designed apk package.
- The `apk` tool will try to parse the malicious package.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious apk package.
- The attacker must convince a victim to use the apk tool to parse this crafted package.

**Additional details:**
- The content provides a code snippet demonstrating the vulnerability within the `apk_tar_parse` function, specifically where `strlen()` is used on `buf.uname`.
- A fix is provided which adds a `HAS_NULLTERM` macro to verify if null terminators are present before string functions are used.
- The content also shows how to reproduce the issue using `valgrind` and a specific test file.
- It also lists the affected versions and the commits that fix the issue.
