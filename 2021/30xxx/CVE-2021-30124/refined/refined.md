Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described as CVE-2021-30124:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the `vscode-phpmd` extension for Visual Studio Code allowing the `phpmd.command` setting to be configured through workspace settings. This setting dictates the command used to execute the PHP Mess Detector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The extension did not properly restrict the modification of the `phpmd.command` setting. By allowing workspace-level configuration, a malicious actor could inject an arbitrary command.
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The ability to control the command executed by the extension through workspace settings allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine by crafting a malicious workspace with a manipulated `phpmd.command` setting.
*   **System Compromise:** This RCE can lead to full system compromise, allowing the attacker to potentially steal sensitive data, install malware, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Workspace Folder:** An attacker crafts a workspace folder with a `.vscode/settings.json` file that sets the `phpmd.command` to a malicious executable.
*   **Victim Opens Malicious Workspace:** The victim opens the malicious workspace in Visual Studio Code, and the extension executes the attacker-controlled command when a PHP file is opened in the workspace.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Workspace:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious workspace folder and its `.vscode/settings.json` file.
*   **Victim's Use of vscode-phpmd Extension:** The victim must have the `vscode-phpmd` extension installed in Visual Studio Code.
*   **Victim Opens Malicious Workspace:** The attacker needs the victim to open the malicious workspace in VS Code for the exploit to trigger.
*   **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability is triggered without requiring any further user interaction after opening the folder.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.3.0 of the `vscode-phpmd` extension.
*   The fix disabled the `phpmd.command` setting at the workspace level.
*   A new setting `phpmd.unsafeCommand` and `phpmd.unsafeCommandEnabled` were introduced. This allows users to use a custom command via workspace settings, but only if explicitly enabled. This option is disabled by default and comes with a warning about potential security risks.
*   The vulnerability was reported by RyotaK.
*   The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 9.8, which indicates a Critical severity.
