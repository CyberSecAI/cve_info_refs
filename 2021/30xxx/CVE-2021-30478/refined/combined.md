# Zulip Server 3.4 security release

  [![](/_astro/alex.rLi04l3I_ZS8spS.webp)](author/alex/)  [Alex Vandiver](author/alex/)   Apr 14, 2021 • 2 min read

Zulip Server 3.4 was released today! This is a security release, containing
important security updates for the 3.x series of Zulip Server.

This will likely be the last release in the 3.x stable release series, as we are
getting close to publishing the first release candidate for Zulip 4.0.

## What’s new

This releases fixes multiple important bugs in previous versions of Zulip. It
contains fixes for the following issues:

* CVE-2021-30487: Prevent administrators from moving topics to disallowed
  streams.
* CVE-2021-30479: Prevent guest user access to `all_public_streams` API.
* CVE-2021-30478: Prevent API super users from forging messages to other
  organizations.
* CVE-2021-30477: Prevent outgoing webhook bots from sending arbitrary messages
  to any stream.
* Fixed a potential HTML injection bug in outgoing emails.
* Fixed Postfix configuration error which would prevent outgoing email to any
  email address containing `.`, `+`, or starting with `mm`, when configured to
  use the local Postfix to deliver outgoing email.
* Fixed a backporting error which caused the `manage.py change_user_role` tool
  to not work for `admin`, `member`, or `guest` roles.
* Add support for logout events sent from modern versions of the desktop
  application.
* Upgraded minor python dependencies.
* Minor documentation fixes.

All of the security bugs in this release were discovered by the Zulip core team.
