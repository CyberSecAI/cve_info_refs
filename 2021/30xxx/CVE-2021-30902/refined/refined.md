- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A use-after-free vulnerability exists due to improper memory management in the Voice Control component.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can cause unexpected application termination or achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** A local attacker, potentially a malicious application, can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code locally on the target device.

The vulnerability exists in the Voice Control component and is triggered due to a use-after-free condition. The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution and unexpected application termination.
