Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-30470:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- An uncontrolled recursive call among the `PdfTokenizer::ReadArray()`, `PdfTokenizer::GetNextVariant()`, and `PdfTokenizer::ReadDataType()` functions within the PoDoFo library can lead to a stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled recursion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stack overflow, potentially leading to denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- By providing a crafted PDF file that triggers the recursive call in `PdfTokenizer` functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PDF file that will be processed by PoDoFo.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in PoDoFo version 0.9.7.
- The issue is related to how the PDF tokenizer parses array structures, leading to the stack overflow.
