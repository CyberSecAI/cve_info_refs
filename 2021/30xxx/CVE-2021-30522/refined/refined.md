{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a use-after-free error in the WebAudio functionality of Google Chrome. When garbage collection occurs, the audio rendering thread might still be referencing an already freed AudioNode object.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code by exploiting this use-after-free vulnerability. The crash occurs when a freed memory region is accessed in the `blink::AudioNodeOutput::Pull` function.",
    "attack_vectors": "A specially crafted web page can trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to trick the user into opening this malicious webpage.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to create a malicious web page that utilizes the WebAudio API in a specific way to trigger the garbage collection and use-after-free conditions. The attacker doesn't require any special privileges, only that a user opens the crafted web page in their browser."
  },
  "additional_details": {
    "technical_details": "The vulnerability occurs because after an AudioNode object is allocated through `createGain()`, and connected to the output with `connect()`, a loop allocates contiguous memory with `new Float32Array/Uint8Array` to trigger garbage collection. During this garbage collection, the audio rendering thread continues to use a freed `AudioNodeOutput` object leading to the use-after-free. The vulnerability is triggered by using indirect calling mechanisms such as `setInterval`, `setTimeout`, or meta refresh.",
