### @IdanHo **[IdanHo](/IdanHo)** commented [Mar 27, 2021](#issue-842516165)

We now also check we have enough space in the incoming buffer for the various signatures and optional (length specified) fields. This helps prevents a possible heap overflow read. (This fixes [#5975](https://github.com/SerenityOS/serenity/issues/5975))

Sorry, something went wrong.
