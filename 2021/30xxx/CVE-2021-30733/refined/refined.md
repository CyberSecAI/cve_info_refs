**Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the processing of maliciously crafted fonts by CoreText. Specifically, improper input validation when handling fonts can cause a read beyond the allocated memory bounds.

**Impact of exploitation:** Processing a maliciously crafted font may result in the disclosure of process memory. An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored in the application's memory.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a maliciously crafted font file. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
- Opening a document containing the malicious font.
- Displaying a webpage with the malicious font embedded.
- Any other means that cause the CoreText framework to render a maliciously crafted font.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a crafted font file to the targeted application or user. This can be achieved through malicious files, websites, or other means.
- No specific privileges or elevated access is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker can be local or remote depending on how the malicious file is delivered.
