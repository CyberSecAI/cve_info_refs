Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-30560:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free flaw in the `xsltApplyTemplates` function within libxslt.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to unpredictable behavior and memory corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS): A malicious crafted file could trigger the use-after-free leading to a crash and termination of the service using libxslt.
- Potential arbitrary code execution: In some scenarios, exploitation of use-after-free vulnerabilities can lead to arbitrary code execution, where the attacker gains control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing of a specially crafted XSLT file: An attacker must provide a crafted XSLT file that, when processed by libxslt, triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted XSLT file to be processed by a system using the vulnerable `libxslt` library.
- This could involve local access to the vulnerable system, or in scenarios where the system processes XSLT files received over a network.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was reported by Nick Wellnhofer.
- The vulnerability exists in libxslt, an XSLT processing runtime library.
- The fix involves upgrading libxslt packages to versions that include the fix.
- Debian assigned DSA-5216-1 to this vulnerability.
- Gentoo assigned GLSA 202310-23 to this vulnerability.
- Google Chrome was also impacted by this vulnerability.
