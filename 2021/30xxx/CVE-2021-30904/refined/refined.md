The provided document contains information about security updates in macOS Monterey 12.0.1, including a fix for CVE-2021-30904.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A sync issue in Messages.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper state validation during the synchronization process of messages, specifically when a user signs out of iMessage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A user's messages may continue to sync even after the user has signed out of iMessage. This could lead to unintended disclosure or continued syncing of message data when the user expects it to be stopped.
- **Attack vectors:** This vulnerability is triggered when a user signs out of iMessage, potentially after sending or receiving messages, exploiting a logic flaw in how the Messages app handles the sign-out process related to ongoing sync operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker doesn't need specific capabilities or positions, as this is a logic flaw within the application itself and is triggered by a user action (signing out of iMessage). However, an attacker might exploit the information if they have access to the user's device or iCloud account.
