Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities described, relating to CVE-2021-30462 and CVE-2021-30463:

**Vulnerability 1: Privilege escalation from user to admin (CVE-2021-30462 likely applies here)**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `v-add-web-domain` shell script, which is called by `/add/web/index.php`. This script creates directories for new web domains. Critically, it uses `chmod` commands on the domain directory without properly checking if the directory or its contents already exist. This allows an attacker to manipulate permissions of existing files and directories through symlinks placed before domain creation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure File Operations:** The script blindly applies `chmod` commands which can be used to modify permissions of files and folders outside the web directory of the newly created domain, which the user should not have access to.
    *   **Symlink exploitation:** The lack of checks allows an attacker to create symbolic links that point to sensitive files/directories, and then manipulate their permissions using the flawed chmod operations.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An authenticated VestaCP user can read the `user.conf` file of the admin user, containing the admin's RKEY, which is used for password reset functionality.
    *   The attacker can then change the admin's password and gain admin access to the panel.
    *   The vulnerability allows reading arbitrary files on the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker with access to the VestaCP panel as a regular user.
    *   The attacker needs to create symlinks in their web directory.
    *   The attacker then creates a new domain using the vulnerable functionality which will change the permissions of the symlinks to what they desire.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An authenticated user account on the VestaCP panel.
    *   Ability to create cron jobs, allowing for a reverse shell for easier exploitation (not strictly required but it facilitates the exploitation).

**Vulnerability 2: Privilege escalation from admin to root (CVE-2021-30463 likely applies here)**

*   **Root Cause:** VestaCP relies on bash scripts in `/usr/local/vesta/bin` for various operations. These scripts are owned by root.  The `sudo -l` configuration allows the admin user to execute any of these scripts as root without requiring a password. The vulnerability comes from the fact that the scripts import `/usr/local/vesta/func/main.sh` using the environment variable `$VESTA`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure Environment Variable Usage:** The scripts use the `$VESTA` environment variable to locate `main.sh` which can be overwritten to point to an attacker controlled file.
    *   **Unrestricted Sudo Access:** The admin user has unrestricted sudo access to the scripts.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker with admin access can overwrite the `$VESTA` environment variable before executing any of the scripts with sudo privileges, which allows them to execute arbitrary code as root.
    *   This leads to complete control of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker with access to the VestaCP panel as an admin.
    *   The attacker needs to create a malicious `main.sh` script in a location they control (e.g. `/tmp`).
    *   The attacker needs to overwrite the `$VESTA` variable to point to their malicious script, before executing any of the VestaCP scripts via sudo.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   An authenticated admin account on the VestaCP panel.
    *   Ability to execute commands as admin on the system.

**Relationship to CVE-2021-30462 and CVE-2021-30463:**

The provided content describes two chained vulnerabilities that result in root access. The first vulnerability, allowing a regular user to escalate to admin privileges by manipulating domain creation and reading the admin user's `user.conf` file, is most likely associated with **CVE-2021-30462**. The second vulnerability, where an admin can escalate to root by exploiting the `VESTA` environment variable and the unrestricted sudo access, is most likely associated with **CVE-2021-30463.** The content provides much more specific technical details than the placeholder description in the CVE.
