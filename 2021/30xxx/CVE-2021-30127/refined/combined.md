## Statistics

Google collects statistics about IPv6 adoption in the Internet on an ongoing basis. We
hope that publishing this information will help Internet providers, website owners, and
policy makers as the industry rolls out IPv6.

* [IPv6 Adoption](#ipv6-adoption)
* [Per-Country IPv6 adoption](#per-country-ipv6-adoption)

#### IPv6 Adoption

We are continuously measuring the availability of IPv6 connectivity among Google
users. The graph shows the percentage of users that access Google over IPv6.

#### Per-Country IPv6 adoption

World | Africa | Asia | Europe | Oceania | North America |
Central America | Caribbean | South America

The chart above shows the availability of IPv6 connectivity around the world.

* Regions where IPv6 is more widely deployed (the darker the green, the greater
  the deployment) and users experience infrequent issues connecting to
  IPv6-enabled websites.
* Regions where IPv6 is more widely deployed but users still experience
  significant reliability or latency issues connecting to IPv6-enabled websites.
* Regions where IPv6 is not widely deployed and users experience significant
  reliability or latency issues connecting to IPv6-enabled websites.

# Troubleshooting Issues Related to NAT

Information on how to troubleshoot Nintendo Switch online connectivity issues related to a network's NAT type.

## Important:

While troubleshooting NAT related issues, it is recommended that you [test your internet connection](/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Use-the-Internet-Connection-Test-1497996.html "How to Use the Internet Connection Test") after making any changes to the settings of your network to determine if the change improved your network's NAT type.

## Additional Information:

* Networks with a more strict NAT type may prevent you from performing some online activities, such as connecting with other players online.
* Both your NAT type and the NAT type any player you are attempting to connect with can affect the connection process. If you are having trouble connecting to a specific player, it is possible the issue may be caused by that player's NAT type.

## What to Do:

1. **Determine how your home network is configured, and what type(s) of network device(s) are being used.**

   Most home networks use the following devices:

   * Combined Modem/Router - A device that both connects you directly to your internet service provider, usually through a cable TV or phone service, and allows multiple devices to connect (either wired or wireless). If you only have one network device, it is likely a combined modem/router (also called a "gateway").
   * Modem - A device that connects you directly to your internet service provider, usually through a cable TV or phone service, but only allows one other device to connect (usually a PC or a router).
   * Router - A device that allows multiple devices to connect (either wired or wireless), but does not connect directly to the internet. A router will connect to either a modem or a combined modem/router before it can connect to the internet.If you're not sure what type of devices you have, you may wish to contact your ISP or whomever provided you with the network devices.

## Which of the following best describes your network configuration?

I have router connected to a modemI have combination modem/routerI have router that is connected to a combination modem/router

1. **Power cycle both your router and modem.**

   [Restarting your network devices](/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Power-Cycle-a-Home-Network-1379018.html "How to Power Cycle a Home Network") may resolve this issue. Ensure both devices power back on again prior to performing a connection test on the Nintendo Switch console.
2. **Within your router's settings, place the Nintendo Switch console into a "DMZ."**

   [Setting up a DMZ](/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Place-a-Nintendo-Switch-Console-into-a-Router-s-DMZ-1510343.html "How to Place a Nintendo Switch Console into a Router's DMZ") will allow the Nintendo Switch system to communicate directly to the internet and bypass the network firewall features of your router, which may be blocking some traffic necessary to connect with others.

   * ## Important:

     While Nintendo provides this information for our consumers' use, it is up to each consumer to determine what security needs they have for their own networks, and to decide how best to configure their network settings to meet those needs.
   * ## Important:

     If this does not resolve your issue and you continue to the next step, disable this setting on your router. A DMZ is not needed in combination with port forwarding.
3. **Within your router's settings, forward ports to the Nintendo Switch console.**

   If your network is blocking traffic needed for online communication, [setting up port forwarding](/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Set-Up-a-Router-s-Port-Forwarding-for-a-Nintendo-Switch-Console-1498000.html "How to Set Up a Router's Port Forwarding for a Nintendo Switch Console") may resolve this.

## Situation Not Resolved:

If you are still unable to connect, this may indicate an issue related to the network environment or router being used.

If you would like to continue troubleshooting potential issues related to the router, contact the router's manufacturer for assistance with performing the following steps:

* Updating the router's firmware
* Resetting the router back to its factory default settings

1. **Power cycle your gateway.**

   [Restarting your network device](/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Power-Cycle-a-Home-Network-1379018.html "How to Power Cycle a Home Network") may resolve this issue. Ensure that it powers back on again prior to performing a connection test on the Nintendo Switch console.
2. **Within your gateway's settings, place the Nintendo Switch console into a "DMZ."**

   [Setting up a DMZ](/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Place-a-Nintendo-Switch-Console-into-a-Router-s-DMZ-1510343.html "How to Place a Nintendo Switch Console into a Router's DMZ") will allow the Nintendo Switch system to communicate directly to the internet and bypass the network firewall features of your gateway, which may be blocking some traffic necessary to connect with others.

   If your network is blocking traffic needed for online communication, [setting up port forwarding](/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Set-Up-a-Router-s-Port-Forwarding-for-a-Nintendo-Switch-Console-1498000.html "How to Set Up a Router's Port Forwarding for a Nintendo Switch Console") may resolve this.

## Situation Not Resolved:

If you are still unable to connect, this may indicate an issue related to the network environment or wireless gateway being used.

If you would like to continue troubleshooting potential issues related to the gateway, contact the device's manufacturer for assistance with performing the following steps:

* Updating the gateway's firmware
* Resetting the gateway back to its factory default settings

1. **Place the gateway into bridge mode.**

   Both a router and gateway are designed to let multiple devices connect, and this means they both handle NAT. Connecting online through both devices' when both are attempting to address NAT for the network can cause issues. If you acess the gateway's settings and place it into bridge mode, the gateway will act as a modem, and then let the router handle NAT for the network.

   * If you would like instructions on how to place a gateway into bridge mode, please contact the gateway manufacturer, or your ISP, for additional assistance.
2. **Power cycle both your router and modem.**

   [Restarting your network devices](/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Power-Cycle-a-Home-Network-1379018.html "How to Power Cycle a Home Network") may resolve this issue. Ensure both devices power back on again prior to performing a connection test on the Nintendo Switch console.

   * ## Important:

     If this does not resolve your issue and you continue to the next step, disable this setting on your router. A DMZ is not needed in combination with port forwarding.
4. **Within your router's settings, forward ports to the Nintendo Switch console.**

   If your network is blocking traffic needed for online communication, [setting up port forwarding](/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-to-Set-Up-a-Router-s-Port-Forwarding-for-a-Nintendo-Switch-Console-1498000.html "How to Set Up a Router's Port Forwarding for a Nintendo Switch Console") may resolve this.

## Situation Not Resolved:

If you are still unable to connect, this may indicate an issue related to the network environment or network devices being used.

If you would like to continue troubleshooting potential issues related to the network devices, contact the manufacturers for assistance with performing the following steps:

* Updating the router or gateway firmware
* Resetting the router or gateway to its factory default settings

# pwnat

```

```
## DESCRIPTION

```

    pwnat, pronounced "poe-nat", is a tool that allows any
    number of clients behind NATs to communicate with a
    server behind a separate NAT with *no* port forwarding
    *no* DMZ setup, and *no* 3rd party involvement. The server
    does not need to know anything about the clients trying
    to connect.

    Simply put, this is a proxy server that works behind a NAT,
    even when the client is behind a different NAT, without any
    3rd party or network changes.

    There is no middle man, no proxy, no 3rd party,
    no UPnP/STUN/ICE required, no spoofing, and no DNS tricks.

    More importantly, the client can then connect to any
    host or port on any remote host or to a fixed host and
    port decided by the server.

    Researched and developed by [Samy Kamkar](https://samy.pl).

    Read the paper, "Autonomous NAT Traversal", joint work with
    [Christian Grothoff](http://grothoff.org/christian/), [Nathan S. Evans](http://www.net.in.tum.de/de/mitarbeiter/evans/), and [Andreas Müller](http://www.net.in.tum.de/de/mitarbeiter/mueller/)
    published by [IEEE](http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/5569876/5569954/05569996.pdf%3Farnumber%3D5569996&authDecision=-203) at the [IEEE P2P'10 Conference](http://p2p10.org/) ([bib](pwnat.bib), [pdf](pwnat.pdf))

    pwnat is based off of the UDP tunneling software by
    Daniel Meekins, [udptunnel](http://code.google.com/p/udptunnel/), and my original [chownat](//samy.pl/chownat/).

## FAQ

```

    Ok, so does this really work?
	Yes. Try it!

    I'm confused. This can't work.
	You should be, and it does work.

    But it can't. My NAT blocks incoming packets and so will the other.
	I know.

    But how?!
	Great question! I thought you'd never ask.
	Look below at [HOW DOES IT WORK?](#HOW)

    Does this use DNS for anything?
	No.

    Do I need to setup port forwarding or a DMZ on either end?
	No.

    Is there some sort of proxy or 3rd party that tunnels information between
    the two NATs at any point?
	No. The connection is entirely direct, client to server.

    Will this work behind my corporate NAT and firewall?
	This will work behind many NATs and firewalls, but not all.

    What uses does this have?
	This will allow you to tunnel any service that you want to run (http,
	ssh, VPN, quake server, IRC, ftp, etc.) through your NAT, or proxy
	into other remote servers.

    What if one or both ends aren't behind a NAT?
	Everything will work just as well. You can use pwnat to tunnel TCP
	payload over UDP if you wish; no NATs are necessary.

    Does the server have to specify the client host?
	No! The server doesn't know the client IP address until the client
	attempts to connect, penetrating the NAT using this unique method.
	The server does need to have any unique prior knowledge about the
	client.

```
## HOW DOES IT WORK?

```

    My method of penetrating NATs is two-fold which I will describe below.

    In order for the full tunnel to be established, the client side needs to
    know the public IP address of the server, and the server needs to learn
    the public IP address of the client.

    However, in a true client-server model, the server doesn't know the client IP
    until the client connects, and NATs will normally drop unknown incoming packets.
    In pwnat, the configuration is the same, the server does not need to know the
    client IP address.

    Here is how the pwnat server first learns the IP address of the client:
    I get around this by having the client "pretend" to be a random hop on
    the Internet. I'm essentially using the same technology a traceroute uses
    to detect hops on the Internet, but I'm doing the reverse in order to
    penetrate the NAT exploiting the stateful translation tables.

    Specifically, when the server starts up, it begins sending fixed ICMP echo
    request packets to the fixed address 3.3.3.3. We expect that these packets
    won't be returned.

    Now, 3.3.3.3 is *not* a host we have any access to, nor will we end up spoofing
    it. Instead, when a client wants to connect, the client (which knows the server
    IP address) sends an [ICMP Time Exceeded](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ICMP_Time_Exceeded) packet to the server. The ICMP packet
    includes the "original" fixed packet that the server was sending to 3.3.3.3.
    The packet is INSIDE the computer. This harcoded packet is built into pwnat
    and acts as an identifier for pwnat.

    Why? Well, the client is  pretending to be a hop on the Internet, politely
    telling the server that its original "ICMP echo request" packet couldn't be
    delivered. Your NAT, being the gapingly open device it is, is nice enough to
    notice that the packet *inside* the ICMP time exceeded packet matches the
    packet the server sent out. Your NAT then forwards the ICMP time exceeded
    back to the server behind the NAT, *including* the full IP header from the
    client, thus allowing the server to know what the client IP address is!

    Server (1.2.3.4): ICMP Echo Request -> 3.3.3.3
    ...
    Server (1.2.3.4): ICMP Echo Request -> 3.3.3.3
    ...
    Server (1.2.3.4): ICMP Echo Request -> 3.3.3.3
    ... every 30 seconds ...

	At this stage, a client wishes to connect
    Client (6.7.8.9): ICMP Time Exceeded (includes ICMP Echo Request to 3.3.3.3) -> 1.2.3.4
    Server's NAT: Sees server's Echo Request in client's Time Exceeded packet,
              sends entire packet to server because it matches server's outgoing packet

    Unsure if this works? Just traceroute any host while behind your NAT. You'll
    notice incoming packets coming in from random IP addresses your router knows
    nothing about. Your router knows to send those back to you, rather than another
    client on your network, based off of the data inside the ICMP time exceeded packet.
![](pwnat.png)

    Now, the server has only learned the client IP address. We still have no
    method to send any additional data. For the full communication, we use the
    same method used in my previous software, [chownat](//samy.pl/chownat/), to penetrate both NATs.

    Example of a client behind a NAT talking to a machine NOT behind a NAT:
    Machine A -> NAT A -> net -> quake server

    Machine A sends a UDP packet to quake server, opening a "session".
    NAT A sees this and says:
    "If any UDP packets come back soon with the same host and port info,
    I'm routing it to machine A."
    Quake server sends UDP packets back, hits NAT A, and NAT A seeing the right
    hosts and ports, sends it to machine A. Machine A and quake server are now
    able to communicate without any problem.

    Now here is how pwnat works now that client and server know each others IP.
    Goal is: Machine A (ssh client) -> NAT A -> net -> NAT B -> Machine B (ssh server)

    When you start up the pwnat server on machine B, it slowly fires off
    UDP packets to machine A. Of course, NAT A is not expecting these so it
    drops every one of them. Machine B does not stop.

    Once you begin the pwnat client on machine A, it begins sending UDP
    packets to machine B. Note: pwnat defaults source and destination
    ports to 2222. Any unprivileged user can set UDP source and dest ports.
    Normally the UDP packets that machine A is sending to NAT B would get dropped.
    However, since machine B is sending similar packets OUT, NAT B assumes
    these are responses and lets them back in. Once machine B sees these packets,
    it sends handshake packets back to machine A. These packets will not get
    dropped by NAT A because of the same reason: NAT A sees packets going out, and
    the packets coming back to the NAT look like responses to the ones going out.

    Finally, both sides are fully communicating over UDP, allowing protocols that
    run over TCP to tunnel through.
    Note: There is a keep-alive process on the pwnat server and client that
    always keeps the UDP "session" active. The packets it sends have a 0 byte
    payload and are only sent when the client is not sending data out. Otherwise,
    the fastest it will possibly send the keep-alive packets is one packet every 5
    seconds. If any other type of data is traveling through the tunnel, no
    keep-alive packets will be transmitted.

```
## EXAMPLE USAGE

```

usage: ./pwnat <-s | -c> <args>

  -c    client mode
    <args>: [local ip] <local port> <proxy host> [proxy port (def:2222)] <remote host> <remote port>

  -s    server mode
    <args>: [local ip] [proxy port (def:2222)] [[allowed host]:[allowed port] ...]

    Server side allowing anyone to proxy:
      ./pwnat -s

    Client wanting to connect to google.com:80:
      ./pwnat -c 8000 <pwnat.server.com> google.com 80
    Then, browse to http://localhost:8000 to visit the google!

DNS je Popelkou Internetu. Drží se v pozadí, nikdo o něm moc neví, ale odvede tolik práce, že bez něj by síť nedokázala fungovat tak, jak ji známe. V naší knize je podrobně rozebereme od základních principů až po náročnější partie. Velkou pozornost věnujeme bezpečnosti, a to jak z pohledu poskytovaných dat, tak z hlediska přenosových protokolů. Je rozhodně o čem psát, protože z jednoduchých principů vyrostlo DNS do komplexního, rozsáhlého a mnohostranně využívaného systému, ostatně stejně jako celý Internet. V knize najdete úplný přehled všech existujících typů zdrojových záznamů, do nichž jsou ukládána data. Orientačně také popisujeme vybrané implementace a jejich používání.

Martin Malý

2023

Kniha „Micro:bit krok za krokem“ je určena jak pro naprosté začátečníky, kteří se teprve s Micro:bitem a programováním seznamují, tak i pro pokročilejší uživatele, kteří už mají zkušenosti s elektronikou a programováním. Součástí knihy jsou i příklady, náměty na pokusy a hry, nebo i stručné „taháky“ a metodické listy, takže kniha najde využití nejen doma, ale i při výuce ve školách. V knize jsou popsány i nejpoužívanější kity a rozšiřující moduly, které jsou v České republice dostupné. Autor pro začátečnický výklad využívá převážně programování pomocí začátečnického blokového editoru MakeCode. Kniha ale obsahuje i referenční příručku pro programování v JavaScriptu či Pythonu a věnuje se i pokročilejším tématům, jako je interní fronta zpráv v operačním systému Micro:bitu nebo tvorba vlastních rozšíření (tedy knihoven). Kniha tak představuje první český ucelený materiál o výukové platformě Micro:bit, vhodný jak pro začátečníky, tak pro pokročilé.

Tomáš Holan

2020

Pokud jste o Unity nikdy neslyšeli, tak je to nástroj, který dovoluje vytvářet profesionálně vypadající 2D i 3D počítačové hry běžící na různých platformách, od Windows přes webové aplikace až po mobilní telefony. O Unity existuje na internetu taková záplava informací, návodů a tutoriálů, že může být těžké rozhodnout se, jak a čím začít. V této knize se autor snaží na příkladu vytváření jedné hry představit základní principy, techniky a stavební prvky, a zároveň upozornit na možné problémy a jejich řešení. Kniha nemá formát příručky nebo učebnice, jde spíše o postupné objevování toho, jaké úkoly potřebujeme při vytváření hry řešit a jaké prostředky k tomu Unity poskytuje. Čtenář by měl mít alespoň minimální povědomí o programování týkající se proměnných, objektů, dosazení, cyklů a funkcí. Zdrojový kód se v Unity píše v jazyku C#, ale k porozumění příkladům bude stačit i znalost nějakého jiného jazyka. Kniha je určena především pro zvědavé studenty středních škol a možná i pro jejich učitele, kteří hledají nějaké zajímavé téma do kurzů informatiky. Při psaní knihy měl autor na mysli také všechny ostatní čtenáře, kteří o Unity už slyšeli a chystají se s ním již nějakou dobu seznámit, ale zatím nevěděli, odkud začít. Tak teď je ta správná chvíle!

Autor ve své třetí knize volně navazuje na předchozí tituly a po úvodu do elektroniky a základech mikroprocesorových konstrukcí přináší úvod do práce s programovatelnými logickými poli. Podrobně se věnuje výkladu jazyka VHDL, který slouží k popisu logických obvodů, a od základních principů pokračuje přes složitější obvody a komponenty až k „systémům na jednom čipu“. Na konci výkladu si díky nabytým znalostem zkonstruujete společně vlastní šestnáctibitový mikroprocesor i s jednoduchým programovým vybavením. Každý krok a každou naučenou dovednost si rovnou vyzkoušíte a aplikujete v praktických příkladech.

IPv6 je novou generací základního protokolu sítě Internet. Řeší především akutní nedostatek adres, ovšem přináší i řadu dalších zajímavých vlastností. V knize se podrobně seznámíte se základními principy IPv6 i jeho podpůrných a doprovodných prvků. Kromě obecného seznámení se schopnostmi protokolu se věnuje i jeho implementacím na vybraných platformách a obsahuje některá doporučení pro praktické použití. Čtvrté vydání odráží aktuální stav příslušných specifikací – včetně nové základní definice v RFC 8200 – a především skutečnost, že po letech nesmělého přešlapování se IPv6 konečně začíná prosazovat v praxi.

Po knize Hradla, volty, jednočipy přichází autor s volným pokračováním, v němž se od základů číslicové techniky přesuneme ke konstrukci složitějších obvodů - totiž vlastních počítačů. Na příkladu tří podrobně popsaných konstrukcí se čtenář naučí základní principy fungování osmibitových počítačů a vyzkouší si i jejich praktický návrh a zapojování. Konstrukce používají legendární osmibitové procesory Intel 8085, MOS 65C02 a Motorola 6809. Kniha popisuje nejen jejich zapojení, ale věnuje se i jejich programování ve strojovém kódu (assembleru). Autor se nevyhnul ani pokročilejším tématům, jako je generování zvuku, zapojování periferií nebo různým způsobům rozšiřování paměti. Všechny konstrukce jsou prakticky ověřené, a ačkoli vycházejí z „ducha osmdesátých let“, tak používají součástky, které lze i dnes poměrně dobře sehnat. Kniha je doplněna online dokumentací jednotlivých konstrukcí, ukázkami programového vybavení a dodatkovým materiálem.

Kniha CyberSecurity se primárně věnuje problematice kybernetické bezpečnosti. Prezentovány jsou základní principy, které by každá osoba, která využívá informační a komunikační technologie, měla respektovat a případně si je měla modifikovat v závislosti na činnosti či účelu, za kterým tyto technologie využívá. Zároveň však kniha obsahuje i dílčí výklad některých právních norem, které s problematikou kybernetické bezpečnosti bezprostředně souvisejí. Relativně samostatnou část knihy představuje komentář k zákonu č. 181/2014 Sb., o kybernetické bezpečnosti a o změně souvisejících zákonů (zákon o kybernetické bezpečnosti). Vedle teoretické a právní části je součástí knihy i praktická část, využitelná zejména IT odborníky, kteří se chtějí vzdělat i v problematice kybernetické bezpečnosti. Z knihy je také možné načerpat informace o činnosti bezpečnostních týmů typu CERT, CSIRT v kyberprostoru, jejich možnostech a limitech.

# No One Can Make You Feel Inferior Without Your Consent

Posted by[quoteresearch](https://quoteinvestigator.com/author/garson/) [April 30, 2012October 5, 2018](https://quoteinvestigator.com/2012/04/30/no-one-inferior/)

**Eleanor Roosevelt? Reader’s Digest? Apocryphal? Anonymous?**

**Dear Quote Investigator**: There is a remarkably insightful statement about self-esteem that is usually credited to Eleanor Roosevelt, the diplomat and former First Lady:

> No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.

This is one of my favorite quotations, but I have not been able to determine when it was first said. One quotation dictionary claimed that the saying was in the autobiography “This is My Story” by Roosevelt, but I was unable to find it.

Did Eleanor Roosevelt really say this? Could you tell me where I can locate this quotation?

**Quote Investigator**: This popular aphorism is the most well-known guidance ascribed to Roosevelt. Quotation experts such as Rosalie Maggio and Ralph Keyes have explored the origin of this saying. Surprisingly, a thorough examination of the books the First Lady authored and her other archived writings has failed to discover any instances of the quote [QVFI].

Yet, the saying has been attributed to Roosevelt for more than seventy years. The earliest example located by **QI** appeared in the pages of the widely-distributed periodical Reader’s Digest in September of 1940 [RDFI]:

> No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
>
> Eleanor Roosevelt

Thus, from the beginning the phrase was credited to Roosevelt. However, no supporting reference was given in the magazine, and the quote stood alone at the bottom of a page with unrelated article text above it.

Recently, **QI** located some intriguing evidence, and he now believes that the creation of this maxim can be traced back to comments made by Eleanor Roosevelt about an awkward event in 1935. The Secretary of Labor in the Roosevelt administration was invited to give a speech at the University of California, Berkeley on the Charter Day of the school. The customary host of the event was unhappy because she felt that the chosen speaker should not have been a political figure. She refused to serve as the host and several newspaper commentators viewed her action as a rebuff and an insult.

Eleanor Roosevelt was asked at a White House press conference whether the Secretary had been snubbed, and her response was widely disseminated in newspapers. Here is an excerpt from an Associated Press article [ERNC]:

> “A snub” defined the first lady, “is the effort of a person who feels superior to make someone else feel inferior. To do so, he has to find someone who can be made to feel inferior.”
>
> She made clear she didn’t think the labor secretary fell within the category of the “snubable.”

Note that this statement by Roosevelt in 1935 contained the key elements of the quotation that was assigned to her by 1940. One person may try to make a second person feel inferior, but this second person can resist and simply refuse to feel inferior. In this example, the labor secretary refused to consent to feel inferior.

The precise wording given for Roosevelt’s statement varied. Here is another example that was printed in a syndicated newspaper column called “So They Say!” the following week. The columnist stated that the following was the definition of a “snub” given by Roosevelt [OWFI]:

> I think it is the effort of a person who feels superior to make someone else feel inferior. First, though, you have to find someone who can be made to feel inferior.

Here are additional selected citations in chronological order.

Sometime between 1935 and 1940 some unknown person synthesized a compact and stylish aphorism based on the commentary made by Eleanor Roosevelt, and that statement was published in the Reader’s Digest. Roosevelt may have performed this reformulation herself, but currently there is no evidence to support that possibility [RDFI]:

> No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.
>
> Eleanor Roosevelt

The next month, in October of 1940 the saying appeared as the first line of an editorial in a newspaper from Iowa. The words were placed between quotation marks, but no attribution was given [LPFI]:

> “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent”
>
> That is a good thing to remember. If you feel uncertain of yourself, it is a good pointer to remember. If you feel uncertain of yourself, it is easy to make you feel inferior by making a slighting remark. But if you feel confident you can laugh it off.

At the end of October the maxim appeared freestanding in an Alaskan newspaper where it was credited to Roosevelt [FDFI]:

> Eleanor Roosevelt, First Lady: “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent.”

In June of 1941 the aphorism appeared on a newspaper page dedicated to the topics of “Home, Church, Religion, Character” within a column titled “Sermonograms”. The words were credited to Eleanor Roosevelt [HNFI].

In February of 1944 the saying appeared in the widely-read syndicated column of Walter Winchell where it was again credited to Roosevelt [WWF1]. In February 1945 the maxim was repeated in Winchell’s influential column. On this second occasion Winchell employed a word from his specialized vocabulary, “Frixample”, in the introduction [WWF2]:

> Mrs. F.D.R. can turn out punchlines with the best of ’em. Frixample: “No one can make you feel inferior without your consent”

The Yale Book of Quotations, an essential reference, contains a compelling precursor to the quote under investigation listed as a cross-index term. More than one-hundred years before the cites above, in 1838, the American clergyman William Ellery Channing said the following [YWEC] [SWEC]:

> No power in society, no hardship in your condition can depress you, keep you down, in knowledge, power, virtue, influence, but by your own consent.

In conclusion, **QI** believes that Eleanor Roosevelt can be credited with expressing the core idea of this saying by 1935. Within five years the graceful modern version of the maxim was synthesized. **QI** does not know if Roosevelt or someone else was responsible for this. But **QI** does believe Roosevelt’s words were the most likely inspiration.

Don't do this, there is no good reason to run UPNP if you care about security, turn it off and learn to manage a firewall. If the author really cares, go one step further and replace the ISP owned router with something with more control.

As others have said it's really necessary for some consumer devices to work properly - especially if you have more than one of the same device. Games consoles are the best example. If you have one console only, then you can usually forward ports manually, but if you have two or more of the same console, and want them to go online at the same time, then you need to use UPnP. If you don't have UPnP enabled on one of the consoles, you'll see issues like being unable to join some games or being unable to do voice chat with certain players. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [happyopossum](user?id=happyopossum) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26685884)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26685240) | [next](#26685796) [–]  > Games consoles are the best example.

Out of the box on most consumer networks, you're going to be able to access things like the store, downloading updates etc. To play with certain players on peer to peer games (which are less common these days) or have a voice chat with certain players, you will need to port forward (manually or with UPnP). You either need to forward ports manually (which can obviously only be done to one console), or use UPnP. The Xbox One and later does have an option to manually ask it to use a different port on multiple consoles for some features (so that you can port forward separately to consoles), but I am unsure if that will solve all issues in such an environment. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [batch12](user?id=batch12) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26686785)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26686101) | [next](#26686323) [–]  This is not true based on my experience with multiple switches and xbox one consoles. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nullify88](user?id=nullify88) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26687562)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26686785) | [next](#26686323) [–]  It does depend on the game. A P2P game like Call of Duty will have problems when played simultaneously on more than one console because the external port can not be shared. What happens though is that another external port gets forwarded to 3074 instead. 3074 -> 3074 3075 -> 3074 3076 -> 3074 etc. Its likely uPnP does this automatically as even uPnP won't be able to map multiple devices to the same external port but it does make the process convenient. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [rubatuga](user?id=rubatuga) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26687601)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26687562) | [next](#26686323) [–]  That’s not how NAT works though. It uses random ports, and there are no collisions, unless you have thousands of Xboxes behind a NAT. Also, remember that CGNAT is a thing, with hundreds of households( with dozens of game consoles) all behind a single IP address. Essentially, the people talking about game consoles not working are wrong. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [oriolid](user?id=oriolid) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26687860)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26687601) | [next](#26688516) [–]  That is how NAT works for connections opened from private network to the Internet. If the console needs to listen to a port, the NAT must be configured to forward the listened port to correct device. Multiple devices behind NAT can not listen to the same port, and this is where the forwarding of different ports on public IP to same port on different private IPs comes in. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [batch12](user?id=batch12) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26690172)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26687860) | [next](#26688516) [–]  The source port would be random and conmunication would ride on that established connection. An exposed port is not necessary for client initiated communication. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nullify88](user?id=nullify88) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26691738)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26690172) | [next](#26688516) [–]  Yes, you're talking about a device behind NAT which initiates a connection to an external service. However, we're talking about a service listening behind NAT (in this case Call of Duty on an Xbox at home) that needs to be listening for connections initiated by other Xboxes to establish a P2P connection. This is what port forwarding enables and this is what uPnP automates. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [voxic11](user?id=voxic11) [on April 5, 2021](item?id=26698355)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26691738) | [next](#26688516) [–]  Why wouldn't they use a solution like <https://samy.pl/pwnat/> this is a long solved problem that doesn't require uPnP. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [oriolid](user?id=oriolid) [on April 5, 2021](item?id=26703333)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26698355) | [next](#26688516) [–]  Is it somehow better than uPnP? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [BlueTemplar](user?id=BlueTemplar) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26688516)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26687601) | [prev](#26687860) | [next](#26686323) [–]  Yes, CGNAT is causing a lot of issues not being able to host multiplayer games, as I've experienced myself (with PC games, though server-client ones, not peer to peer ones).

Depending on the game you're playing, that may or may not be an issue. It can stop you connecting to certain players in a peer to peer scenario. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [monocasa](user?id=monocasa) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26686091)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26686034) | [next](#26682802) [–]  It'll be fine. They'll be on two pretty arbitrary public ports, but it works just fine if you have a vaguely sane nat implementation in your router. That's the whole point of nat punching. And even if you have an incredibly broken nat implementation that won't accept UDP packets from other sources than the server you originally connected to, there's a fallback pathway at the first layer of that port 3074 protocol that bridges p2p messages through live's backend. As another example, last time I checked WebRTC didn't use UPnP, but has all the same issues as a fundamentally P2P UDP protocol. They use STUN/ICE/TURN, live uses custom protocols filling the same niches. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [daveoc64](user?id=daveoc64) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26686147)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26686091) | [next](#26686256) [–]  This Xbox help article explains how having a "Moderate" or "Strict" NAT can affect you and how it can be solved: [https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/connect...](https://support.xbox.com/en-GB/help/hardware-network/connect-network/xbox-one-nat-error) I don't think anything has fundamentally changed in this area since the days of the Xbox 360.

Other players in this space have had these capabilities for over a decade, and you can call to get help. Ubiquiti might be inexpensive, but its still more than double the price of Grandstream's SoHo/SMB router and access point offerings while offering equivalent support and features. Really neither of these offerings are good outside the SoHo and single location business space. I wish for OpenWRT, OPNsense or WatchGuard's configurability wrapped in a single interface that lets you see the router, switches and access points performance live while letting you alter their settings, without seriously kneecapped router capabilities. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jiggawatts](user?id=jiggawatts) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26686226)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26683539) | [prev](#26685465) | [next](#26688591) [–]  > IPv6 can be a privacy issue Why do people throw this out there as if it's a fact we all agree on?

It is dynamically configuring NAT to provide a specific translation. The same kind of dynamic translation happens the other way for any allowed outgoing traffic, and lots of old NAT traversal tricks made use of that before UPNP was a thing. The hole was always there. People get this topic confused all the time because the majority of network devices doing NAT are also acting as firewalls of varying efficacy. There are basically no non-firewall routers anymore, they all have at least simple network address ACLs. The purpose of upnp is touchless configuration. If you care about security, that is orthogonal to your goals, and so it must be restricted by some other policy enforcement. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bscphil](user?id=bscphil) [on April 5, 2021](item?id=26696121)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26685391) | [next](#26688619) [–]  Good point, I should have been more careful about the terminology.

Combine that with most users being happy and comfortable with 1 IP address and there was no mass market appeal for IPv6 hardware or software. I'd go so far as saying the vast majority of people do not even realise their machines can be accessed from the outside world when they only have one public address behind their "firewalled super safe ISP router", and would be terrified to find out they can. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [eqvinox](user?id=eqvinox) [on April 3, 2021](item?id=26684353)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26684221) | [next](#26684356) [–]  > <http://ipv6now.com.au/primers/IPv6RoutingSecurity.php> Everything listed there either also applies/transfers to IPv4 or is not applicable at all to the situation you're evaluating. > Makes it obvious why it still hasn't gotten anywhere Uh....

The mass market appeal for IPv6 is the fact that we do not have enough IPv4 to actually give one internet connection a unique IP. CGNAT is getting ever more present in the marketplace as a result of this. Major providers *are* rolling out IPv6. eg in the USA, several major cable/fibre providers provide v6, several mobile networks provide IPv6 using things like 464xlat. It's the same in the UK - BT for example provide IPv6 on consumer internet connections, EE (a major phone carrier) provide v6 and use 464xlat to provide v4 connectivity to handsets. India and Germany are further ahead still, generally. Google's IPv6 stats are a good indicator of just how much v6 is in use now: [https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6...](https://www.google.com/intl/en/ipv6/statistics.html#tab=ipv6-adoption) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kaliszad](user?id=kaliszad) [on April 3, 2021](item?id=26685249)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26684221) | [prev](#26684356) | [next](#26688660) [–]  Usually, inbound IPv6 are firewalled by the ISP router just fine. As far as I know, there is UPnP with IPv6 though there seems to be some work into that direction. Also, current CGNAT setups tend to close connections before they should according to RFCs: [https://anderstrier.dk/2021/01/11/my-isp-is-killing-my-idle-...](https://anderstrier.dk/2021/01/11/my-isp-is-killing-my-idle-ssh-sessions-yours-might-be-too/) All the IPv6 routing security has to be done with IPv4 as well. ARP -> NDP, prevent source address spoofing, DHCP guard/ RA guard are basically two sides of the same coin. Serious networking hardware supports this for years or there are firmware updates supporting it. For about the last 5 years, supporting IPv6 became much easier, almost as easy as supporting IPv4 for most of the real world use cases. Anyway, the reality is, we don't really have much choice other than to migrate to IPv6 sooner or later. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [BlueTemplar](user?id=BlueTemplar) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26688644)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26685249) | [next](#26688660) [–]  Pretty often, IPv6 is NOT firewalls (or the firewall is opt-in which in practice amounts to the same thing). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kaliszad](user?id=kaliszad) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26693534)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26688644) | [next](#26688660) [–]  Perhaps.

But in general, IPv6 as a protocol is just fine, at least equally secure as IPv4 and not more complex than IPv4 in many practical cases. I would even go so far to say it is way easier to do a clean address plan with IPv6. Usually, IPv6 inbound access is blocked by default on the ISP routers firewall. In practical networks, IPv4 tends to be set up in some way and usually seems to work correctly - until you discover all the atrocious hacks people have commited over the ~ 25 years of practical, widespread use. Quite often multiple levels of NAT without much reason for it, UPnP where it shouldn't be, payment for even single IP addresses (great, we are paying for numbers other people got basically for free) and more - IPv4 are often handled like pets. Compared to IPv6, it is much harder to do a simple split into security groups based on prefix with IPv4. (In IPv6, you can usually just give every broadcast domain a /64 and will not do a huge mistake - they are a single security group. Sometimes, you might want to hand out a /64 or even shorter prefix to every client though.) There are some great resources for modern and practical IPv6 too: <https://knihy.nic.cz/#IPv6-2019> (4th edition in Czech by Pavel Satrapa, but can be translated using Google Translate and is more or less ok as a translation: [https://docs.google.com/document/d/10CRjSRBLcdqtGjJgaW5Sct5h...](https://docs.google.com/document/d/10CRjSRBLcdqtGjJgaW5Sct5hH8LOGW7tIDtkx4asaYo/edit?usp=sharing)) there are older books in English that are also mostly relevant still.

UPnP works great, *if you control which devices get on your network*. Static port forwarding combined with DHCP gets annoying quickly, you end up having to set up static assignments for every device that may need a port forwarded, which can be a lot, with modern multiplayer gaming and p2p. And for applications that select a random port on startup, such as some bittorrent clients, you either have to manually forward the port every time or select a static port. UPnP serves a purpose and is extremely convenient, as long as you trust the devices on your network. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [lostlogin](user?id=lostlogin) [on April 3, 2021](item?id=26683055)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26682547) | [next](#26683342) [–]  > And for applications that select a random port on startup, such as some bittorrent clients, you either have to manually forward the port every time or select a static port.

Otherwise peers will exchange other peers that are visible to them so that your client might eventually learn how the other peer that wanted that piece is reachable and connects to it. So it actually will work without port forwarding but reaching your client will be harder and thus less peers inside the swarm will be available to you or them, likely making it slower. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [daniellarusso](user?id=daniellarusso) [on April 3, 2021](item?id=26683342)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26682547) | [prev](#26683055) | [next](#26682829) [–]  So, keeping track of which device on your network belongs to which MAC address, and reserving an address for each, is that what you mean by ‘annoying’ - the administration of that? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [KozmoNau7](user?id=KozmoNau7) [on April 3, 2021](item?id=26683594)   | [root](#26682371) | [parent](#26683342) | [next](#26682829) [–]  That's the easy part. Plenty of applications (such as bittorrent clients) use randomized ports. So you have to either disable that, manually add the port forward every time you start the client, or let UPnP handle it, because you don't let any untrusted devices or apps onto your network.

If the suffix stays stable then with iptables you can use netmasks where you mask out the prefix rather than the suffix.

I'm doubtful that all applications make that distinction and advertise the right address. If they just use some external "what is my IP" service to determine their address because that's what they did for IPv4 then they'll get the privacy address and advertise that to peers because that'll be picked by default for outgoing connections.

Once you get comfortable with something like pfSense I highly recommend switching to regular Free/OpenBSD, or Linux depending on what you're comfortable with. I find it much easier to manage a gateway with the entire configuration in version control than a GUI. There aren't that many services that a gateway needs to run. If you feel like you'll miss pf on the \*BSDs check out nftables on Linux. It's not as well documented but it's much less painful than iptables.

But the problem isn't security. It's Trust. Consumers generally trust that manufacturers will follow Best Practices and that security is part of the deal: I pay you money, you give me a quality product that Just Works and is Secure. False. Products are made to be *sold at a profit*. You can imagine that some engineer at that company knows about this problem, put in a Jira bug for it and since it didn't affect overall functionality, and because the product needed to be released as soon as possible, they rejected the bug and sent it off. By default, we should NOT trust that things are Good and Secure. If we are security conscious, then it's on us as consumers to figure out how to mitigate these problems. Or is it? If I was this guy, I'd box that thing up and send it back and give the company feedback as to why, and then I'd show them this very blog post. The manufacturer probably won't care. They know that until the average consumer cares about security *and knows how to mitigate problems* it won't matter. And we all know that the average consumer, even of technical products, has security habits.

However, the author doesn't want to just disable uPnP in their router and manage forwarding directly due to a perceived loss of convenience. Surely, first discovering by happenstance that a devices is doing this in the first place, then trying to figure out how to go through idiosyncratic & unsupported means to change the device's behavior, is significantly less convenient than updating a router/firewall config rules in supported standard predictable ways on occasion? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bscphil](user?id=bscphil) [on April 3, 2021](item?id=26683773)   | [parent](#26682461) | [next](#26682644) [–]  Given this: > My router is an ISP provisioned one so the feature-set there is somewhat limited My assumption was that their router doesn't support disabling uPnP for a single client, so it's 100% on or 100% off.

I bought a Fractal Node 304 case (room for 6 drives), put an ITX board in it, a PCIe SATA controller and set it up as btrfs RAID, with CIFS, NFS and FTP. Not a huge outlay and so much better than a hacked-together Pi solution. It also functions as my DNS and DHCP (Pi-Hole in a Docker container) and since it has hardware video decoding, it works great as an always-on HTPC, which is practical for apartment living. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Tildey](user?id=Tildey) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26688245)   | [root](#26687104) | [parent](#26688157) | [next](#26687420) [–]  3 USB drives in a raid setup isn’t any less redundant than 3 SATA drives in the same setup (mathematically anyway, excluding potential bus problems which don’t really seem to be much of an issue these days). Personally I also have a node 304 based nas, but I’ve seen plenty of people with low cost Pi setups and no major issues. Plugging a few drives into a Pi is much easier if you don’t have experience with building computers, and is still a couple hundred dollars cheaper than something like that. Also worth noting that it’s possible to connect PCIe devices to a Pi, although I believe you need a specific model. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Ballas](user?id=Ballas) [on April 4, 2021](item?id=26687420)   | [parent](#26687104) | [prev](#26687262) | [next](#26682594) [–]  Perhaps look at some of the Odroid Homecloud solutions?

There's talk here about disabling UPnP but does that mean that the devices wouldn't be able to find each other? I don't want to babysit my router. Or aren't they using UPnP? Quick googling wasn't successful. I thought most of those autodiscover-services use UPnP. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kalleboo](user?id=kalleboo) [on April 3, 2021](item?id=26682691)   | [parent](#26682594) | [next](#26682728) [–]  There are 2 parts to UPnP. One is service discovery, in cooperation with zeroconf (aka bonjour/mDNS). This is handled 100% by devices themselves. The other is the port forwarding protocol, where devices can ask your router to open a port in the NAT to the wide internet forwarded to them. This is done in the router. It's also a potential massive security hole. If you disable UPnP on your router, you only disable the second thing. The first thing keeps working. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ryandrake](user?id=ryandrake) [on April 3, 2021](item?id=26683276)   | [root](#26682594) | [parent](#26682691) | [next](#26702365) [–]  The service discovery isn't really the security hole though, is it? I mean I have mDNS configured on my LAN. It's the port forwarding, and specifically, configuring it so that any rando device on the network can set up port forwarding, which is the security problem. If you really want the dubious convenience of UPnP port forwarding, at least limit it to the one or two devices on your LAN that need it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kalleboo](user?id=kalleboo) [on April 3, 2021](item?id=26683361)   | [root](#26682594) | [parent](#26683276) | [next](#26683411) [–]  Right, service discovery is fine.

This might be, say, a bittorrent client needing to allow other clients in on a port to share the file... sharing. To share. :) If you understand how Active vs Passive FTP works and how the incoming connections might need to be tracked (nf\_conntrack for Linux folks), UPNP is more like that - apps which handle bi-directional conversations with the outside world beyond your router. Airdrop uses an ad-hoc WiFi network (peer-to-peer) with TLS, as does I think (Android) Beam. If I'm not mistaken some other devices in this area (Chromecast, Roku, etc.) use similar techniques, and sometimes leverage bluetooth ad-hoc networks. Discovery services like printers and fileshares tend to use (I'm assuming you're macOS) Bonjour (Rendezvous, renamed awhile back), which is sort of like an ad-hoc multicast (mDNS) solution if I understand it. On Windows it would use something like Netbios - conceptually the same. I just set a static IP on my wifi printer and call it a day, it's trivial stuff being a printer. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [CrLf](user?id=CrLf) [on April 3, 2021](item?id=26685221)   | [prev](#26682594) | [next](#26691431) [–]  > Unfortunately, disabling uPnP these days is too much of a hit to convenience I've disabled UPnP on every router I owned.

# My ISP Is Killing My Idle SSH Sessions. Yours Might Be Too.

tl;dr: My ISP’s CGNAT session timeout is too short, meaning TCP keepalives gets dropped. Test if your own NAT, or your ISP’s CGN, violates [RFC5382](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5382)‘s REQ-5 using this tool: <https://github.com/AndersTrier/NAT-TCP-test>.

I have been working from home more lately, where I have SSH sessions open to the servers that I’m working on. Often when I return to my computer, or switch to a SSH session that has been sitting idle for a while, the SSH connection is either dead or frozen. If the session is not already dead, the only way to gain control over my terminal again, is to send the ‘terminate connection’ [ssh escape sequence](https://lonesysadmin.net/2011/11/08/ssh-escape-sequences-aka-kill-dead-ssh-sessions/) **<enter>~.** after which SSH errors like this:

client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe
```

This happened one day while I was transferring a VM image in the hundreds of gigabytes from one server to another using netcat like so:

```
ato@host2:~$ nc -l 1337 > hugefile
ato@host1:~$ nc -q 1 host2 1337 < hugefile
```

This transfer would take multiple hours, and when I checked in after it should have finished, my SSH connections had died yet again. And sshd had taken netcat down with it, killing the transfer midway.

That’s when I decided to investigate this problem.

The OpenBSD and OpenSSH developers are known for their extreme focus on code quality. The chances that this problem is caused by a bug in OpenSSH are very slim. (In the same line as “It is (almost) never a compiler error.”)

This is probably a network problem.

I connected my laptop directly to my ISP’s “customer-provided equipment”: a coax modem in bridge mode. Then I ran tcpdump both on my laptop and on the server, and opened a SSH connection. After leaving it idle for about 2 1/2 hours, this is the result:

Client: 100.68.156.34 / 203.0.113.1, server: 130.225.254.99.

Client side

![](https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ssh-session-serverside.png)

Server side

A SSH session does not generate any traffic, unless there’s new output or input. The same is true for TCP. That is why, after the TCP and SSH sessions have been established, no more packages are sent for a long time.

First thing to note, is that my laptop gets an IP in the [Carrier-grade NAT address space 100.64.0.0/10](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598), which my ISP then translates to a public internet routable IP. (Because I don’t want to leak my public IP, I used the [tcprewrite](https://tcpreplay.appneta.com/wiki/tcprewrite) tool to substitute that IP with one in [TEST-NET-3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737)).

Next thing to note, is that after about 2 hours, both the client and the server starts to send TCP-keepalive packages, but none of them come through to the other side.

Finally the client gives up on the TCP session, and sends a TCP reset package, which surprisingly goes through.

Lets see what we can find in the OpenSSH man pages about timeouts and keepalives (ssh\_config(5)):

```
TCPKeepAlive
    Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side.  If they are sent, death of the
    connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  This option only uses TCP keepalives (as op‐
    posed to using ssh level keepalives), so takes a long time to notice when the connection dies.  As such, you proba‐
    bly want the ServerAliveInterval option as well.  However, this means that connections will die if the route is down
    temporarily, and some people find it annoying.
    The default is yes (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice if the network goes down or the re‐
    mote host dies.  This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.
    To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to no.  See also ServerAliveInterval for protocol-level
    keepalives.
ServerAliveInterval
    Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a mes‐
    sage through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.  The default is 0, indicating that these
    messages will not be sent to the server, or 300 if the BatchMode option is set (Debian-specific).
```

So **TCPKeepAlive** enables keepalives handled by the TCP stack implementation (Linux in my case), whereas **ServerAliveInterval** enables protocol level keep-alives (handled by OpenSSH).

This explains the behavior we’re observing, but also raises new questions:

1. Can I fix my problem by enabling the ssh protocol-level-keepalives? (ServerAliveInterval)
2. Why are the TCP keepalives only sent after 2 hours?
3. Why is my ISP dropping my TCP keepalive packages?

I verified that by setting **ServerAliveInterval** to 300 (5 min), my problems disappeared. We could stop now that I found a workaround, but let’s keep digging.

The TCP keepalive interval on Linux is configured by **net.ipv4.tcp\_keepalive\_time**, which by default is set to 2 hours (7200).

```
anders@ubuntu-desktop:~$ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 7200
```

Why is it set to two hours? We find our answer in [RFC1122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122):

```
Keep-alive packets MUST only be sent when no data or
acknowledgement packets have been received for the
connection within an interval.  This interval MUST be
configurable and MUST default to no less than two hours.
```

In the following DISCUSSION section, the RFC writers elaborate on why they (in 1989) think TCP keep-alives only should be sent infrequently:

```
The TCP specification does not include a keep-alive mechanism because it could:
(1) cause perfectly good connections to break during transient Internet failures;
(2) consume unnecessary bandwidth ("if no one is using the connection, who cares if it is still good?"); and
(3) cost money for an Internet path that charges for packets.
```

Today the Internet is different from what it was in 1989 when they published that RFC. Now we have NAT everywhere, which is a hack that was accepted on IPv4 because the IPv4 address space is too small. The real solution is IPv6 which has a much bigger address space (2^32 vs 2^128).

NAT (Network Address Translation) allows many computers on a network to share the same IP. This typically works by routing your packet to a device which translates/substitutes your private [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) IP (e.g 192.168.0.0/16) for a public one, and passes on the packet.

CGN (Carrier-grade NAT) is NAT run by an ISP. This allows for many customers to share a single public IP (because even with every household being assigned a single IPv4, we’re still running out). To avoid collisions with the [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) ranges, ISPs are told to use the 100.64.0.0/10 range. With this setup it is not uncommon to have 3 levels of NAT. Ex, CGN, CPE that also does NAT, and the customers own router.

A NAT device must keep track of which connections are made by the clients. This information is stored in the NAT table. Whenever a packet arrives from the Internet, it checks if the packet belongs to a connection in its NAT table, to determine which client to send the package to. If it doesn’t belong to any connections, it drops the packet.

This wouldn’t work if the NAT table only stored IP addresses – which client should the NAT device send the packet to if receiving a packet from a server two of its clients are connected to? That is why – unlike routers – NAT devices have to cross protocol boundaries, and look deeper inside the packet, and find a “[transport identifier](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3022)“. For TCP and UDP the identifiers used are the source and destination port numbers, and for ICMP the Query [Identifier](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792) is usually used.

A NAT table looks something like this (we’ll ignore ICMP for now):

```
PROTOCOL SRCIP       SRCPORT DSTIP          DSTPORT NEWSRCPORT IDLETIME
TCP      192.168.1.1 52264   130.225.254.99 22      52264      983
UDP      192.168.1.2 39252   8.8.8.8        53      39252      0
```

This NAT hack unfortunately opened up Pandora’s box of problems that we are still dealing with today. For example, you can no longer initiate a connection to a computer behind NAT. The NAT device does not know which host to send the packet to. This is why NAT’ing is often equated with firewalling. It is not a feature as such. It is a side effect of the NAT hack.

Back when NAT was introduced, it was not uncommon for protocols to rely on the server establishing a second connection back to the client. In “Active FTP” for example, the server will initiate a new connection back to the client (the data channel) after the client has connected. For this to work the NAT must be even more protocol aware, and preemptively create a mapping for the requested port. The same is true for SIP (used for VoIP) and a few other protocols. This is why most NAT devices can be configured to be FTP and SIP aware. Exactly this feature was recently shown to be a huge security problem – you can trigger this functionality to create a mapping of your choosing from a visitors browser, and connect to any device behind the visitors NAT. Read more about the [NAT Slipstreaming attack here](https://github.com/samyk/slipstream).

For big data transfers, or latency sensitive connections (file sharing, VoIP, gaming etc) it is very much preferable to have a direct connection between hosts. But if both hosts are behind a NAT, this is not immediately possible. To solve this problem, a new hack was introduced: [NAT hole punching](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389), where you – by using a third-party – can trick your NAT devices to allow traffic directly between the hosts by creating a NAT table entry (“punching” a hole) in both NATs simultaneously. It is only somewhat reliable, and works best with UDP in my experience.

NAT is also one of the reasons the new [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-transport/?include_text=1) protocol uses UDP packages instead of its own protocol. Too many devices will fail to handle the packet correctly if they introduced a new [protocol number](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml) to use in the IP header. Where should the NAT device look for a transport identifier in an unknown protocol header?

Another problem that arises because of NAT is: when is it safe to remove an entry from the NAT table? Sometimes the answer is simple: when you see that the connection has been closed (e.g the TCP Normal Close Sequence). But when is it safe to remove an established TCP connection (were you haven’t yet seen the connection being closed) on which no packages have been sent for a long time? Lets check what [RFC5382: NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5382) has to say.

```
TCP connections can stay in established phase indefinitely without
exchanging any packets.  Some end-hosts can be configured to send
keep-alive packets on such idle connections; by default, such keep-
alive packets are sent every 2 hours if enabled [[RFC1122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122)].
Consequently, a NAT that waits for slightly over 2 hours can detect
idle connections with keep-alive packets being sent at the default
rate.

REQ-5:  If a NAT cannot determine whether the endpoints of a TCP
connection are active, it MAY abandon the session if it has been
idle for some time.  In such cases, the value of the "established
connection idle-timeout" MUST NOT be less than 2 hours 4 minutes.
```

On Linux this timeout is controlled by [nf\_conntrack\_tcp\_timeout\_established](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/nf_conntrack-sysctl.txt) which by default is 5 days. On OpenWRT for example this is lowered to 7440 seconds (2 hours and 4 minutes) to work better on slow hardware.

Alright. Enough rant about NAT. Let’s begin probing my ISP to test if they respect the 2 hours and 4 minutes timeout.

I wrote three different tests which can be found here: <https://github.com/AndersTrier/NAT-TCP-test>

The idea is to establish a TCP connection to a server, wait some time and then send some data to test if the connection still works. This way we can discover the timeout period before the NAT will drop the connection. Using a single TCP connection at a time, this would take forever. Instead the tests will spawn 130 connections on startup, and test the first connection after 1 minute, the second after 2 minutes and so on (2 hours and 10 minutes total).

**tcp-send-test** will do exactly that.

**tcp-recv-test** will instead ask the server to test the connections (i.e be the one to try and send some send data after waiting).

**tcp-keepalive-test** works essentially the same way as tcp-send-test, but instead of sending actual data, it will use TCP-keepalives. (Maybe my ISP simply drops all keepalive packages?)

By default, the tests are configured to connect to a server sponsored by the non-profit organization [dotsrc.org](https://dotsrc.org/).

This is the output from **tcp-send-test** when I tested my ISP:

```

```

We found the culprit! The connection tested after waiting slightly more than 60 minutes didn’t work, meaning they dropped the connection from their NAT table. 1 hour is too short time for them to wait – they should wait at least 2 hours and 4 minutes. I documented my findings, and sent an email to my ISP. I quickly got a response back acknowledging that this is a bug on their side, and thanking me for my research. They still haven’t fixed the problem though.

The tcp-keepalive-test gave the same result, but strangely enough the tcp-recv-test reported all connections as working. I assume this is because I pay my ISP to have a static public IPv4 mapped to my CGN address. But then why did the server’s keepalive packages get dropped in the SSH example? I speculate that my ISP drops those because they don’t refer to a valid TCP session anymore.

Actually they shouldn’t track my connections at all – they should just forward all packages, and only translate the source or destination IP. But that’s a problem for another day.

If you run the tests, you should start both **tcp-send-test** and **tcp-recv-test**. I’ve seen some CGN implementations that only fail the **tcp-recv-test**.

Here’s what a test looks like with a NAT/CGN that is RFC compliant:

```
anders@ubuntu-laptop:~/git/NAT-TCP-test$ ./tcp-recv-test
 [+] All connections established
 [+] Waiting for the server to close a connection
 [+] Open connections: 130
 [+] Connection 0 returned after 1m 0s: 60

 [+] Waiting for the server to close a connection
 [+] Open connections: 129
 [+] Connection 1 returned after 2m 0s: 120

[...]

 [+] Waiting for the server to close a connection
 [+] Open connections: 8
 [+] Connection 122 returned after 123m 11s: 7380

 [+] Waiting for the server to close a connection
 [+] Open connections: 7

/* no more output produced by the application */
```

Thanks for reading! I hope you learned something. I’m available for hire. I do computer security and networking. Shoot me an email at hi@<this domain>.

Update: I heard back from my ISP. They told me that the session timeout on their CGN is more than a day, so they continued to investigate the problem (using the tooling I wrote).

They were able to determine that it is actually the cable/coax modem (provided by my ISP) that is killing my idle connections! When put in “bridge mode” it still does connection tracking, and it drops packages which do not belong to any known connections. On this device the idle-timeout is 1 hour. This timeout should be updated to be at least 2 hours and 4 minutes, but it would be even better if it didn’t do any connection tracking at all while in bridge mode.

"So if you are in the market for a very compact chassis to house your Mini ITX or DTX motherboard that has flexibility, features and great looks then yeah, the Fractal Design Node 304 should be very high on your shopping list. It is compact, looks great and would make for an excellent file-server thanks to the large amount of HDD space. Pop in a AMD APU based motherboard like we did and boom, you just created yourself a fine Home Theater PC."

"The build quality is solid and the case is nicely ventilated, plus with the ability for this to be used as a smart looking HTPC and/or a nas unit makes it stand out from the crowd and not only justify its price but also the OC3D Gold award."

Hi everybody,

I’m pleased to announce that WireGuard now runs inside the FreeBSD
kernel, with a driver called if_wg. It has full support of wg(8) and
wg-quick(8) [5], as well as general integration into FreeBSD userland.
Performance should be decent. The implementation in FreeBSD’s main
branch should pretty much work, though it’s something of a so-so work in
progress. To learn what I mean there, read on…

Sometime ago, a popular firewall vendor tasked a developer with writing
a WireGuard implementation for FreeBSD. They didn’t bother reaching out
to the project. That’s okay, I figured, I’ll reach out and see if I can
help and coordinate. What followed over the next year was a series of
poor communications – messages unanswered, code reviews ignored, that
kind of thing. Usually collaborations I’ve had with others have been
full of excitement, but it just didn’t work out here. In the few
discussions we were able to have, I did get across some key points,
like, “you’ll save a bunch of time if you use the OpenBSD code as a
starting point.” But mostly it seemed like a stop-and-go effort that the
WireGuard project didn’t have much to do with. Then, at some point,
whatever code laying around got merged into the FreeBSD tree and the
developer tasked with writing it moved on.

Fortunately, two weeks before FreeBSD 13.0 was due to be released,
FreeBSD core developer Kyle Evans emailed the list about integrating
wireguard-tools (wg(8) and such). In the ensuing discussion I mentioned
that we really need to get the actual if_wg kernel implementation up to
snuff. We took the conversation to IRC, and agreed that we should work
on figuring out what to do before the release date. At the same time,
Matt Dunwoodie, who worked on the OpenBSD implementation, also took a
look at what had become of that implementation in FreeBSD. Over the next
week, the three of us dug in and completely reworked the implementation
from top to bottom, each one of us pushing commits and taking passes
through the code to ensure correctness. The result was [6]. It was an
incredible effort. The collaboration was very fast paced and exciting.
Matt and Kyle are terrific programmers and fun to work with too.

The first step was assessing the current state of the code the previous
developer had dumped into the tree. It was not pretty. I imagined
strange Internet voices jeering, “this is what gives C a bad name!”
There were random sleeps added to “fix” race conditions, validation
functions that just returned true, catastrophic cryptographic
vulnerabilities, whole parts of the protocol unimplemented, kernel
panics, security bypasses, overflows, random printf statements deep in
crypto code, the most spectacular buffer overflows, and the whole litany
of awful things that go wrong when people aren’t careful when they write
C. Or, more simply, it seems typical of what happens when code ships
that wasn’t meant to. It was essentially an incomplete half-baked
implementation – nothing close to something anybody would want on a
production machine. Matt had to talk me out of just insisting they pull
the code entirely, and rework it more slowly and carefully for the next
release cycle. And he was right: nobody would have agreed to do that,
and it would only have fostered frustration from folks genuinely
enthusiastic about if_wg. So our one and only option was to iteratively
improve it as fast as we could during the two weeks before release, and
try to make it as simple and close as possible to OpenBSD so that we
could benefit from the previous analysis done there. With that as our
mission, we set out auditing and rewriting code.

One curious thing of note is that there were 40,000 lines of optimized
crypto implementations pulled out of the Linux kernel compat module but
not really wired up correctly, and mangled beyond repair with mazes of
Linux→FreeBSD ifdefs. I wound up replacing this with an 1,800 line file,
crypto.c [1], containing all of the cryptographic primitives needed to
implement WireGuard. Aside from its place in the FreeBSD story, this is
kind of neat in its own right: these are simple, but fast enough,
reference implementations. It’s not deliberately tiny or obfuscated like
TweetNaCl is, yet is still just a single file, and the Curve25519 field
arithmetic in it is formally verified. Maybe other projects will find
use for it. Future releases will hopefully get rid of crypto.c and hook
into FreeBSD’s already existing optimized implementations [4], which
should give a nice performance boost, but given the time crunch, having
something boring, safe, and simple seemed like the way to go.

We reduced the project structure down to four C files – the
aforementioned crypto.c, two files copied verbatim from OpenBSD –
wg_noise.c and wg_cookie.c – and if_wg.c, the actual interface device
driver implementation and protocol logic. The IPC interface was reworked
as well, and wg(8) in the wireguard-tools package grew support for it
(also rewritten from the original attempt). The three of us spent
countless hours across three time zones auditing state machine logic,
running trials,  and generally trying to get this working and workable.
There are now even a few automated tests!

I think we’ve mostly succeeded in producing something that behaves like
WireGuard. The net result certainly isn’t perfect, though – the Linux
and OpenBSD implementations were long, careful, slow projects by
comparison – but it is at least a base on which to build and improve
over time. Going forward, I think there’ll be additional systems coding
issues to work out – locking, lifetimes, races, and that sort of thing.
But now that there’s at least a stable base, developers can work out
remaining issues incrementally.

But perhaps this is a good moment to step back and ask how we got here,
and what WireGuard itself really is.

Traditionally, network protocols are specified in a document of protocol
behaviors. Then different organizations implement that specification.
Then everybody interoperates and all goes well. In practice, it often
doesn’t go well (see IPsec woes), but this at least has been the
traditional way of doing this on the Internet, and in some ways it
works.

But that is not the approach taken by the WireGuard project. In
contrast, WireGuard is both a protocol and a set of implementations,
implemented with a particular set of security and safety techniques.
That’s a radical departure from the traditional model, and one surely to
raise some grumbles amongst graybeards. But I believe this is a
necessary and beneficial quality for having the types of high assurance
software that is needed for core Internet security infrastructure. When
you use WireGuard, you’re not just using some protocol that is capable
of producing packets that are legible by others. You’re also using an
implementation that’s been designed to avoid security pitfalls, and that
provides interfaces for using it that mitigate footguns. In that way,
the WireGuard project is more expansive than a mere protocol project or
a mere software project or a mere cryptography project or a mere
specification project or a mere interface project. It combines all of
those things into a single unified approach. (For this same reason, the
original WireGuard paper [2] has been difficult for folks to categorize.
Is this a systems paper? A networking paper? A crypto paper?)

Because of that, I think this was an understandable predicament. After
all, why shouldn’t a company be able to task a developer with writing
some ring-0 WireGuard code in C? And why does it matter to me whether
the code is garbage if it can at least produce protocol packets? The
reason is that the WireGuard project’s mission is wider than that. We
deeply care about code quality and implementation particulars.

While we now have the FreeBSD code in a maintainable state, there are
other projects too that could use some attention from us. Looking
forward, for example, we hope to be able to lend a hand similarly to the
NetBSD developers soon to help them finish their implementation; this is
long overdue on my part, and I owe them some time and energy there. And
I hope that others don’t hesitate to email the list asking for
collaboration. This kind of thing is, of course, one of the reasons that
the project as an organization exists.

To return to the primary announcement, I had originally hoped to say
that this would be shipping for 13.0, and have some instructions for
setup there, but unfortunately, and contrary to our plans, it looks
exceedingly likely that given the grave issues we found in the existing
code, they’ll in the end just disable the module from the release, and
revisit for 13.1, rather than merging our fixes a few short days before
the release. That’s a bit of a bummer, given how hard we worked to get
things done in the time crunch, but it’s also probably a very wise
decision that takes some courage to make, and this will give us more
time to really get this rock solid for 13.1.

As well, hopefully we’ll have backport modules for the 13.0 and 12.y
release, making it as available as possible. Kyle or I will update the
list when  we’ve got a standalone backport module ready, with
instructions, as well as updating [3] per usual. There’s also ongoing
work to integrate WireGuard interface setup into rc, and hopefully that
will land during the the next release window, as well as the
aforementioned improvements to optimized crypto and systems issues.

Enjoy,
Jason

Set of networking protocols[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/b/be/UPnP_logo.png)](/wiki/File%3AUPnP_logo.png)

UPnP logo as promoted by the UPnP Forum (2001–2016) and [Open Connectivity Foundation](/wiki/Open_Connectivity_Foundation "Open Connectivity Foundation") (2016–present)

**Universal Plug and Play** (**UPnP**) is a set of [networking protocols](/wiki/Networking_protocol "Networking protocol") on the [Internet Protocol](/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP) that permits networked devices, such as personal computers, printers, [Internet gateways](/wiki/Gateway_%28telecommunications%29 "Gateway (telecommunications)"), [Wi-Fi](/wiki/Wi-Fi "Wi-Fi") access points and mobile devices, to seamlessly discover each other's presence on the network and establish functional network services. UPnP is intended primarily for residential networks without enterprise-class devices.

UPnP assumes the network runs IP, and then uses [HTTP](/wiki/HTTP "HTTP") on top of IP to provide device/service description, actions, data transfer and [event notification](/wiki/Event_notification "Event notification"). Device search requests and advertisements are supported by running HTTP on top of [UDP](/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") ([port](/wiki/Port_%28computer_networking%29 "Port (computer networking)") 1900) using [multicast](/wiki/Multicast "Multicast") (known as HTTPMU). Responses to search requests are also sent over UDP, but are instead sent using [unicast](/wiki/Unicast "Unicast") (known as HTTPU).

Conceptually, UPnP extends [plug and play](/wiki/Plug_and_play "Plug and play")—a technology for dynamically attaching devices directly to a computer—to [zero-configuration networking](/wiki/Zero-configuration_networking "Zero-configuration networking") for residential and [SOHO](/wiki/Small_office/home_office "Small office/home office") wireless networks. UPnP devices are plug-and-play in that, when connected to a network, they automatically establish working configurations with other devices, removing the need for users to manually configure and add devices through [IP addresses](/wiki/IP_address "IP address").[[1]](#cite_note-1)

UPnP is generally regarded as unsuitable for deployment in business settings for reasons of economy, complexity, and consistency: the multicast foundation makes it chatty, consuming too many network resources on networks with a large population of devices; the simplified access controls do not map well to complex environments; and it does not provide a uniform configuration syntax such as the CLI environments of Cisco IOS or JUNOS.[*[citation needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ACitation_needed "Wikipedia:Citation needed")*]

## Overview

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Overview")]

The UPnP architecture allows device-to-device networking of [consumer electronics](/wiki/Consumer_electronics "Consumer electronics"), [mobile](/wiki/Mobile_phone "Mobile phone") devices, [personal computers](/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"), and networked [home appliances](/wiki/Home_appliance "Home appliance"). It is a distributed, [open architecture](/wiki/Open_architecture "Open architecture") protocol based on established standards such as the [Internet Protocol Suite](/wiki/Internet_Protocol_Suite "Internet Protocol Suite") (TCP/IP), [HTTP](/wiki/HTTP "HTTP"), [XML](/wiki/XML "XML"), and [SOAP](/wiki/SOAP_%28protocol%29 "SOAP (protocol)"). UPnP *control points* (CPs) are devices which use UPnP protocols to control UPnP *controlled devices* (CDs).[[2]](#cite_note-2)

The UPnP architecture supports zero-configuration networking. A UPnP-compatible device from any vendor can dynamically join a network, obtain an IP address, announce its name, advertise or convey its capabilities upon request, and learn about the presence and capabilities of other devices. [Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol](/wiki/Dynamic_Host_Configuration_Protocol "Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol") (DHCP) and [Domain Name System](/wiki/Domain_Name_System "Domain Name System") (DNS) servers are optional and are only used if they are available on the network. Devices can disconnect from the network automatically without leaving [state](/wiki/State_%28computer_science%29 "State (computer science)") information.

UPnP was published as a 73-part [international standard](/wiki/International_standard "International standard") ISO/IEC 29341 in December 2008.[[3]](#cite_note-uda-v1.0-3)[[4]](#cite_note-uda-v1.1-4)[[5]](#cite_note-uda-v2.0-5)[[6]](#cite_note-igd-v1.0-v2.0-6)[[7]](#cite_note-7)[[8]](#cite_note-8)

Other UPnP features include:

Media and device independence
UPnP technology can run on many media that support IP, including [Ethernet](/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet"), [FireWire](/wiki/FireWire "FireWire"), IR ([IrDA](/wiki/IrDA "IrDA")), home wiring ([G.hn](/wiki/G.hn "G.hn")) and RF ([Bluetooth](/wiki/Bluetooth "Bluetooth"), [Wi-Fi](/wiki/Wi-Fi "Wi-Fi")). No special [device driver](/wiki/Device_driver "Device driver") support is necessary; common network protocols are used instead.
[User interface](/wiki/User_interface "User interface") (UI) control
*Optionally*, the UPnP architecture enables devices to present a user interface through a [web browser](/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser") (see [Presentation](#Presentation) below).
[Operating system](/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") and [programming language](/wiki/Programming_language "Programming language") independence
Any operating system and any programming language can be used to build UPnP products. UPnP stacks are available for most platforms and operating systems in both closed- and open-source forms.
Programmatic control
UPnP architecture also enables conventional application programmatic control.[*[clarification needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3APlease_clarify "Wikipedia:Please clarify")*]
Extensibility
Each UPnP product can have device-specific services layered on top of the basic architecture. In addition to combining services defined by UPnP Forum in various ways, vendors can define their own device and service types, and can extend standard devices and services with vendor-defined actions, state variables, data structure elements, and variable values.
## Protocol

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Protocol")]

UPnP uses common [Internet](/wiki/Internet "Internet") technologies. It assumes the network must run [Internet Protocol](/wiki/Internet_Protocol "Internet Protocol") (IP) and then uses [HTTP](/wiki/HTTP "HTTP"), [SOAP](/wiki/SOAP "SOAP") and [XML](/wiki/XML "XML") on top of IP, in order to provide device/service description, actions, data transfer and eventing. Device search requests and advertisements are supported by running HTTP on top of [UDP](/wiki/User_Datagram_Protocol "User Datagram Protocol") using [multicast](/wiki/Multicast "Multicast") (known as HTTPMU). Responses to search requests are also sent over UDP, but are instead sent using [unicast](/wiki/Unicast "Unicast") (known as HTTPU). UPnP uses UDP due to its lower overhead in not requiring confirmation of received data and retransmission of corrupt packets. HTTPU and HTTPMU were initially submitted as an [Internet Draft](/wiki/Internet_Draft "Internet Draft"), but it expired in 2001;[[9]](#cite_note-9) these specifications have since been integrated into the actual UPnP specifications.

UPnP uses UDP port 1900, and all used [TCP](/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol "Transmission Control Protocol") ports are derived from the SSDP alive and response messages.[[10]](#cite_note-10)

### Addressing

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Addressing")]

The foundation for UPnP networking is IP addressing. Each device must implement a DHCP client and search for a DHCP server when the device is first connected to the network. If no DHCP server is available, the device must assign itself an address. The process by which a UPnP device assigns itself an address is known within the UPnP Device Architecture as [AutoIP](/wiki/AutoIP "AutoIP"). In UPnP Device Architecture Version 1.0,[[3]](#cite_note-uda-v1.0-3) AutoIP is defined within the specification itself; in UPnP Device Architecture Version 1.1,[[4]](#cite_note-uda-v1.1-4) AutoIP references [IETF](/wiki/Internet_Engineering_Task_Force "Internet Engineering Task Force") [RFC](/wiki/RFC_%28identifier%29 "RFC (identifier)") [3927](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3927). If during the DHCP transaction, the device obtains a domain name, for example, through a DNS server or via [DNS forwarding](/w/index.php?title=DNS_forwarding&action=edit&redlink=1 "DNS forwarding (page does not exist)"), the device should use that name in subsequent network operations; otherwise, the device should use its IP address.

### Discovery

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Discovery")]

Once a device has established an IP address, the next step in UPnP networking is discovery. The UPnP discovery protocol is known as the [Simple Service Discovery Protocol](/wiki/Simple_Service_Discovery_Protocol "Simple Service Discovery Protocol") (SSDP). When a device is added to the network, SSDP allows that device to advertise its services to control points on the network. This is achieved by sending SSDP alive messages. When a control point is added to the network, SSDP allows that control point to actively search for devices of interest on the network or listen passively to the SSDP alive messages of devices. The fundamental exchange is a discovery message containing a few essential specifics about the device or one of its services, for example, its type, identifier, and a pointer (network location) to more detailed information.

### Description

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Description")]

After a control point has discovered a device, the control point still knows very little about the device. For the control point to learn more about the device and its capabilities, or to interact with the device, the control point must retrieve the device's description from the location ([URL](/wiki/URL "URL")) provided by the device in the discovery message. The UPnP Device Description is expressed in [XML](/wiki/XML "XML") and includes vendor-specific manufacturer information like the model name and number, [serial number](/wiki/Serial_number "Serial number"), manufacturer name, (presentation) URLs to vendor-specific web sites, etc. The description also includes a list of any embedded services. For each service, the Device Description document lists the URLs for control, eventing and service description. Each service description includes a list of the [commands](/wiki/Command_%28computing%29 "Command (computing)"), or *actions*, to which the service responds, and parameters, or *arguments*, for each action; the description for a service also includes a list of [variables](/wiki/Variable_%28programming%29 "Variable (programming)"); these variables model the state of the service at [run time](/wiki/Run_time_%28program_lifecycle_phase%29 "Run time (program lifecycle phase)") and are described in terms of their data type, range, and event characteristics.

### Control

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: Control")]

Having retrieved a description of the device, the control point can send actions to a device's service. To do this, a control point sends a suitable control message to the control URL for the service (provided in the device description). Control messages are also expressed in XML using the [Simple Object Access Protocol](/wiki/SOAP_%28protocol%29 "SOAP (protocol)") (SOAP). Much like [function calls](/wiki/Function_call "Function call"), the service returns any action-specific values in response to the control message. The effects of the action, if any, are modeled by changes in the variables that describe the run-time state of the service.

### Event notification

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: Event notification")]

Another capability of UPnP networking is [event notification](/wiki/Event_notification "Event notification"), or *eventing*. The event notification protocol defined in the UPnP Device Architecture is known as [General Event Notification Architecture](/wiki/General_Event_Notification_Architecture "General Event Notification Architecture") (GENA). A UPnP description for a service includes a list of actions the service responds to and a list of variables that model the state of the service at run time. The service publishes updates when these variables change, and a control point may subscribe to receive this information. The service publishes updates by sending event messages. Event messages contain the names of one or more state variables and the current value of those variables. These messages are also expressed in XML. A special initial event message is sent when a control point first subscribes; this event message contains the names and values for all *evented* variables and allows the subscriber to initialize its model of the state of the service. To support scenarios with multiple control points, eventing is designed to keep all control points equally informed about the effects of any action. Therefore, all subscribers are sent all event messages, subscribers receive event messages for all "evented" variables that have changed, and event messages are sent no matter why the state variable changed (either in response to a requested action or because the state the service is modeling changed).

### Presentation

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: Presentation")]

The final step in UPnP networking is presentation. If a device has a URL for presentation, then the control point can retrieve a page from this URL, load the page into a [web browser](/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser"), and depending on the capabilities of the page, allow a user to control the device and/or view device status. The degree to which each of these can be accomplished depends on the specific capabilities of the presentation page and device.

## AV standards

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=9 "Edit section: AV standards")]

*UPnP AV architecture* is an audio and video extension of the UPnP, supporting a variety of devices such as TVs, VCRs, CD/DVD players/jukeboxes, settop boxes, stereos systems, MP3 players, still image cameras, camcorders, electronic picture frames (EPFs), and personal computers. The UPnP AV architecture allows devices to support different types of formats for the entertainment content, including MPEG2, MPEG4, JPEG, MP3, Windows Media Audio (WMA), bitmaps (BMP), and NTSC, PAL or ATSC formats. Multiple types of transfer protocols are supported, including IEEE 1394, HTTP, RTP and TCP/IP.[[11]](#cite_note-UPnP-av-AVArchitecture-v2-11)

On 12 July 2006, the UPnP Forum announced the release of version 2 of the UPnP Audio and Video specifications,[[12]](#cite_note-12) with new *MediaServer* (MS) version 2.0 and *MediaRenderer* (MR) version 2.0 classes. These enhancements are created by adding capabilities to the MediaServer and MediaRenderer device classes, allowing a higher level of interoperability between products made by different manufacturers. Some of the early devices complying with these standards were marketed by [Philips](/wiki/Philips "Philips") under the [Streamium](/wiki/Streamium "Streamium") brand name.

Since 2006, versions 3 and 4 of the UPnP audio and video device control protocols have been published.[[13]](#cite_note-13) In March 2013, an updated uPnP AV architecture specification was published, incorporating the updated device control protocols.[[11]](#cite_note-UPnP-av-AVArchitecture-v2-11) UPnP Device Architecture 2.0 was released in April 2020.

The UPnP AV standards have been referenced in specifications published by other organizations including [Digital Living Network Alliance](/wiki/Digital_Living_Network_Alliance "Digital Living Network Alliance") Networked Device Interoperability Guidelines,[[14]](#cite_note-14) [International Electrotechnical Commission](/wiki/International_Electrotechnical_Commission "International Electrotechnical Commission") IEC 62481-1,[[15]](#cite_note-15) and [Cable Television Laboratories](/wiki/CableLabs "CableLabs") OpenCable Home Networking Protocol.[[16]](#cite_note-16)

## AV components

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: AV components")]

Generally a UPnP audio/video (AV) architecture consists of:[[17]](#cite_note-17)

* Control Point: a device that discovers Media Servers and Media Renderers, then connects them
* Media Server: the server that stores content on the network to be accessed by Media Renderers
* Media Renderer: a device that renders ('plays') content received from a Media Server.

### Media server

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Media server")]

A **UPnP AV media server** is the UPnP-server ("master" device) that provides media library information and streams media-data (like audio/video/picture/files) to UPnP clients on the network. It is a computer system or a similar digital appliance that stores digital media, such as photographs, movies, or music and shares these with other devices.

UPnP AV media servers provide a service to UPnP AV client devices, so-called *control points*, for browsing the media content of the server and request the media server to deliver a file to the control point for playback.

UPnP media servers are available for most [operating systems](/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system") and many hardware platforms. UPnP AV media servers can either be categorized as [software](/wiki/Software "Software")-based or hardware-based. Software-based UPnP AV media servers can be run on a [PC](/wiki/Personal_computer "Personal computer"). Hardware-based UPnP AV media servers may run on any [NAS](/wiki/Network-attached_storage "Network-attached storage") devices or any specific hardware for delivering media, such as a [DVR](/wiki/Digital_video_recorder "Digital video recorder"). As of May 2008, there were more software-based UPnP AV media servers than there were hardware-based servers.

### Other components

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: Other components")]

* **UPnP MediaServer ControlPoint** - which is the UPnP-client (a 'slave' device) that can auto-detect UPnP-servers on the network to browse and stream media/data-files from them.
* **UPnP MediaRenderer DCP** - which is a 'slave' device that can render (play) content.
* **UPnP RenderingControl DCP** - control MediaRenderer settings; volume, brightness, RGB, sharpness, and more.
* **UPnP Remote User Interface (RUI) client/server** - which sends/receives control-commands between the UPnP-client and UPnP-server over network, (like record, schedule, play, pause, stop, etc.).
  + **Web4CE (CEA 2014) for UPnP Remote UI[[18]](#cite_note-18)** - CEA-2014 standard designed by **[Consumer Electronics Association](/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Association "Consumer Electronics Association")'s R7 Home Network Committee**. [Web](/wiki/Web_page "Web page")-based [Protocol](/wiki/Protocol_%28computing%29 "Protocol (computing)") and [Framework](/wiki/Software_framework "Software framework") for Remote User Interface on UPnP [Networks](/wiki/Computer_networking "Computer networking") and the [Internet](/wiki/Internet "Internet") (Web4CE). This standard allows a UPnP-capable home network device to provide its [interface](/wiki/User_interface "User interface") (display and control options) as a [web page](/wiki/Web_page "Web page") to display on any other device connected to the home network. That means that one can control a [home networking](/wiki/Computer_networking "Computer networking") device through any [web-browser](/wiki/Web_browser "Web browser")-based communications method for [CE devices](/wiki/Consumer_Electronics_Association "Consumer Electronics Association") on a UPnP home network using [ethernet](/wiki/Ethernet "Ethernet") and a special version of [HTML](/wiki/HTML "HTML") called [CE-HTML](/wiki/CE-HTML "CE-HTML").
* **QoS (quality of service)** - is an important (but not mandatory) service function for use with UPnP AV (Audio and Video). [QoS (quality of service)](/wiki/Quality_of_service "Quality of service") refers to control mechanisms that can provide different priority to different users or data flows, or guarantee a certain level of performance to a data flow in accordance with requests from the application program. Since UPnP AV is mostly to deliver [streaming media](/wiki/Streaming_media "Streaming media") that is often [near real-time](/wiki/Near_real-time "Near real-time") or real-time audio/video data which it is critical to be delivered within a specific time or the stream is interrupted. QoS guarantees are especially important if the network capacity is limited, for example public networks, like the [internet](/wiki/Internet "Internet").
  + QoS for UPnP consist of **Sink Device** (client-side/front-end) and **Source Device** (server-side/back-end) service functions. With [classes](/wiki/Class_%28computer_science%29 "Class (computer science)") such as; **Traffic Class** that indicates the kind of traffic in the traffic stream, (for example, audio or video). **Traffic Identifier (TID)** which identifies data packets as belonging to a unique traffic stream. **Traffic Specification (TSPEC)** which contains a set of parameters that define the characteristics of the traffic stream, (for example operating requirement and scheduling). **Traffic Stream (TS)** which is a unidirectional flow of data that originates at a source device and terminates at one or more sink device(s).
* **Remote Access** - defines methods for connecting UPnP device sets that are not in the same multicast domain.

## NAT traversal

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=13 "Edit section: NAT traversal")]

One solution for [NAT traversal](/wiki/NAT_traversal "NAT traversal"), called the [Internet Gateway Device Control Protocol](/wiki/Internet_Gateway_Device_Protocol "Internet Gateway Device Protocol") (UPnP IGD Protocol), is implemented via UPnP. Many [routers](/wiki/Router_%28computing%29 "Router (computing)") and [firewalls](/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29 "Firewall (computing)") expose themselves as Internet Gateway Devices, allowing any local UPnP control point to perform a variety of actions, including retrieving the external IP address of the device, enumerating existing port mappings, and adding or removing port mappings. By adding a port mapping, a UPnP controller behind the IGD can enable traversal of the IGD from an external address to an internal client.

There are numerous compatibility issues due the different interpretations of the very large actually backward compatible IGDv1 and IGDv2 specifications. One of them is the UPnP IGD client integrated with current Microsoft Windows and Xbox systems with certified IGDv2 routers. The compatibility issue still exist since the introduced of the IGDv1 client in Windows XP in 2001, and a IGDv2 router without a workaround that makes router port mapping impossible.[[19]](#cite_note-19)

If UPnP is only used to control router port mappings and pinholes, there are alternative, newer much simpler and lightweight protocols such as the [PCP](/wiki/Port_Control_Protocol "Port Control Protocol") and the [NAT-PMP](/wiki/NAT_Port_Mapping_Protocol "NAT Port Mapping Protocol"), both of which have been standardized as RFCs by the IETF. These alternatives are not yet known to have compatibility issues between different clients and servers, but adoption is still low. For consumer routers, only [AVM](/wiki/AVM_GmbH "AVM GmbH") and the open-source router software projects [OpenWrt](/wiki/OpenWrt "OpenWrt"), [OPNsense](/wiki/OPNsense "OPNsense"), and [pfSense](/wiki/PfSense "PfSense") are currently known to support [PCP](/wiki/Port_Control_Protocol "Port Control Protocol") as an alternative to UPnP. [AVM](/wiki/AVM_GmbH "AVM GmbH")'s [Fritz!Box](/wiki/Fritz%21Box "Fritz!Box") UPnP IGDv2 and PCP implementation has been very buggy since its introduction. In many cases it does not work.[[20]](#cite_note-20)[[21]](#cite_note-21)[[22]](#cite_note-22)[[23]](#cite_note-23)[[24]](#cite_note-24)

## Problems

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=14 "Edit section: Problems")]
### Authentication

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=15 "Edit section: Authentication")]

The UPnP protocol, by default, does not implement any [authentication](/wiki/Authentication "Authentication"), so UPnP device implementations must implement the additional *Device Protection* service,[[25]](#cite_note-25) or implement the *Device Security Service*.[[26]](#cite_note-26) There also exists a non-standard solution called UPnP-UP (Universal Plug and Play - User Profile)[[27]](#cite_note-27)[[28]](#cite_note-28) which proposes an extension to allow user authentication and authorization mechanisms for UPnP devices and applications. Many UPnP device implementations lack authentication mechanisms, and by default assume local systems and their users are completely trustworthy.[[29]](#cite_note-29)[[30]](#cite_note-30)

When the authentication mechanisms are not implemented, [routers](/wiki/Router_%28computing%29 "Router (computing)") and [firewalls](/wiki/Firewall_%28computing%29 "Firewall (computing)") running the UPnP IGD protocol are vulnerable to attack. For example, [Adobe Flash](/wiki/Adobe_Flash "Adobe Flash") programs running outside the sandbox of the browser (e.g. this requires specific version of Adobe Flash with acknowledged security issues) are capable of generating a specific type of [HTTP](/wiki/HTTP "HTTP") request which allows a router implementing the UPnP IGD protocol to be controlled by a malicious web site when someone with a UPnP-enabled router simply visits that web site.[[31]](#cite_note-31) This only applies to the ["firewall-hole-punching"-feature of UPnP](#NAT_traversal); it does not apply when the router/firewall does not support UPnP IGD or has been disabled on the router. Also, not all routers can have such things as DNS server settings altered by UPnP because much of the specification (including LAN Host Configuration) is optional for UPnP enabled routers.[[6]](#cite_note-igd-v1.0-v2.0-6) As a result, some UPnP devices ship with UPnP turned off by default as a security measure.

### Access from the Internet

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=16 "Edit section: Access from the Internet")]

In 2011, researcher Daniel Garcia developed a tool designed to exploit a flaw in some UPnP IGD device stacks that allow UPnP requests from the Internet.[[32]](#cite_note-32)[[33]](#cite_note-33) The tool was made public at DEFCON 19 and allows portmapping requests to external IP addresses from the device and internal IP addresses behind the NAT. The problem is widely propagated around the world, with scans showing millions of vulnerable devices at a time.[[34]](#cite_note-34)

In January 2013, the security company Rapid7 in Boston reported[[35]](#cite_note-35) on a six-month research programme. A team scanned for signals from UPnP-enabled devices announcing their availability for internet connection. Some 6900 network-aware products from 1500 companies at 81 million IP-addresses responded to their requests. 80% of the devices are home routers; others include printers, webcams and surveillance cameras. Using the UPnP-protocol, many of those devices can be accessed and/or manipulated.

In February 2013, the UPnP forum responded in a press release[[36]](#cite_note-36) by recommending more recent versions of the used UPnP stacks, and by improving the certification program to include checks to avoid further such issues.

### IGMP snooping and reliability

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=17 "Edit section: IGMP snooping and reliability")]

UPnP is often the only significant multicast application in use in digital home networks; therefore, multicast network misconfiguration or other deficiencies can appear as UPnP issues rather than underlying network issues.

If [IGMP snooping](/wiki/IGMP_snooping "IGMP snooping") is enabled on a switch, or more commonly a wireless router/switch, it will interfere with UPnP/DLNA device discovery (SSDP) if incorrectly or incompletely configured (e.g. without an active querier or IGMP proxy), making UPnP appear unreliable.

Typical scenarios observed include a server or client (e.g. smart TV) appearing after power on, and then disappearing after a few minutes (often 30 by default configuration) due to IGMP group membership expiring.

### Callback vulnerability

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Universal_Plug_and_Play&action=edit&section=18 "Edit section: Callback vulnerability")]

On 8 June 2020, yet another protocol design flaw was announced.[[37]](#cite_note-37) Dubbed "CallStranger"[[38]](#cite_note-38) by its discoverer, it allows an attacker to subvert the event subscription mechanism and execute a variety of attacks: amplification of requests for use in DDoS; enumeration; and data exfiltration.

OCF had published a fix to the protocol specification in April 2020,[[39]](#cite_note-39) but since many devices running UPnP are not easily upgradable, CallStranger is likely to remain a threat for a long time to come.[[40]](#cite_note-40) CallStranger has fueled calls for end-users to abandon UPnP because of repeated failures in security of its design and implementation.[[41]](#cite_note-41)

The UPnP protocols were promoted by the UPnP Forum (formed in October 1999),[[42]](#cite_note-42) a computer industry initiative to enable simple and robust connectivity to standalone devices and personal computers from many different vendors. The Forum consisted of more than 800 vendors involved in everything from consumer electronics to network computing. Since 2016, all UPnP efforts have been managed by the [Open Connectivity Foundation](/wiki/Open_Connectivity_Foundation "Open Connectivity Foundation") (OCF).

In the fall of 2008, the UPnP Forum ratified the successor to UPnP 1.0 Device Architecture, UPnP 1.1.[[43]](#cite_note-43) The [Devices Profile for Web Services](/wiki/Devices_Profile_for_Web_Services "Devices Profile for Web Services") (DPWS) standard was a candidate successor to UPnP, but UPnP 1.1 was selected by the UPnP Forum. Version 2 of IGD is standardized.[[44]](#cite_note-44)

The UPnP Internet Gateway Device (IGD)[[6]](#cite_note-igd-v1.0-v2.0-6) standard has a WANIPConnection service, which provides similar functionality to [IETF](/wiki/IETF "IETF")-standard [Port Control Protocol](/wiki/Port_Control_Protocol "Port Control Protocol"). The [NAT-PMP](/wiki/NAT-PMP "NAT-PMP") specification contains a list of the problems with IGDP[[45]](#cite_note-rfc-6886-45): 26–32 that prompted the creation of NAT-PMP and its successor PCP.

A number of further standards have been defined for the UPnP Device Architecture:

* The [Wi-Fi Alliance](/wiki/Wi-Fi_Alliance "Wi-Fi Alliance") defines a set of "WFA device" (`urn:schemas-wifialliance-org:device:WFADevice`) services related to the wireless access point.
  + The WFAWLANConfig service is a required part and defines ways to query the capabilities of a wireless access point and set up wireless connections.[[46]](#cite_note-46) This service is used in the AP-ER and UPnP-C types of [Wi-Fi Protected Setup](/wiki/Wi-Fi_Protected_Setup "Wi-Fi Protected Setup").[[47]](#cite_note-47)

# Buffer overruns, license violations, and bad code: FreeBSD 13’s close call

40,000 lines of flawed code almost made it into FreeBSD's kernel—we examine how.

At first glance, Matthew Macy seemed like a perfectly reasonable choice to port WireGuard into the FreeBSD kernel. WireGuard is an encrypted point-to-point tunneling protocol, part of what most people think of as a "VPN." FreeBSD is a Unix-like operating system that powers everything from Cisco and Juniper routers to Netflix's network stack, and Macy had plenty of experience on its dev team, including work on multiple network drivers.

So when Jim Thompson, the CEO of Netgate, which makes FreeBSD-powered routers, decided it was time for FreeBSD to enjoy the same level of in-kernel WireGuard support that Linux does, he reached out to offer Macy a contract. Macy would port WireGuard into the FreeBSD kernel, where Netgate could then use it in the company's popular pfSense router distribution. The contract was offered without deadlines or milestones; Macy was simply to get the job done on his own schedule.

With Macy's level of experience—with kernel coding and network stacks in particular—the project looked like a slam dunk. But things went awry almost immediately. WireGuard founding developer Jason Donenfeld didn't hear about the project until it surfaced on a FreeBSD mailing list, and Macy didn't seem interested in Donenfeld's assistance when offered. After roughly nine months of part-time development, Macy committed his port—largely unreviewed and inadequately tested—directly into the HEAD section of FreeBSD's code repository, where it was scheduled for incorporation into FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE.

This unexpected commit raised the stakes for Donenfeld, whose project would ultimately be judged on the quality of any production release under the WireGuard name. Donenfeld identified numerous problems with Macy's code, but rather than object to the port's release, Donenfeld decided to fix the issues. He collaborated with FreeBSD developer Kyle Evans and with Matt Dunwoodie, an OpenBSD developer who had worked on WireGuard for that operating system. The three replaced almost all of Macy's code in a mad week-long sprint.

This went over very poorly with Netgate, which sponsored Macy's work. Netgate had already taken Macy's beta code from a FreeBSD 13 release candidate and placed it into production in pfSense's 2.5.0 release. The forklift upgrade performed by Donenfeld and collaborators—along with Donenfeld's sharp characterization of Macy's code—presented the company with a serious PR problem.

Netgate's public response included [accusations](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/dev-commits-src-main/2021-March/002835.html) of "irrational bias against mmacy and Netgate" and irresponsible [disclosure](https://www.netgate.com/blog/painful-lessons-learned-in-security-and-community.html) of "a number of zero-day exploits"—despite Netgate's near-simultaneous [declaration](https://www.netgate.com/blog/painful-lessons-learned-in-security-and-community.html) that no actual vulnerabilities existed.

This combative response from Netgate raised increased scrutiny from many sources, which uncovered surprising elements of Macy's own past. He and his wife Nicole had been [arrested](https://www.theregister.com/2008/04/24/kip_macy_arrest/) in 2008 after two years spent attempting to illegally evict tenants from a small San Francisco apartment building the pair had bought.

The Macys' attempts to force their tenants out included sawing through floor support joists to make the building unfit for human habitation, sawing [holes](https://www.theregister.com/2008/04/24/kip_macy_arrest/) directly through the floors of tenants' apartments, and forging extremely threatening emails appearing to be from the tenants themselves. The couple [fled](https://abcnews.go.com/US/exclusive-landlord-hell-defends-terrorizing-apartment-tenants/story?id=20875476) to Italy to avoid prosecution but were eventually extradited back to the US—where they pled guilty to a reduced set of felonies and served four years and four months each.

Macy's history as a landlord, unsurprisingly, dogged him professionally—which contributed to his own lack of attention to the doomed WireGuard port.

"I didn't even want to do this work," Macy eventually told us. "I was burned out, spent many months with post-COVID syndrome... I'd suffered through years of verbal abuse from non-doers and semi-non-doers in the project whose one big one up on me is that they aren't felons. I jumped at the opportunity to leave the project in December... I just felt a moral obligation to get [the WireGuard port] over the finish line. So you'll have to forgive me if my final efforts were a bit half-hearted."

This admission answers why such an experienced, qualified developer might produce inferior code—but it raises much larger questions about process and procedure within the FreeBSD core committee itself.

How did so much sub-par code make it so far into a major open source operating system? Where was the code review which should have stopped it? And why did both the FreeBSD core team and Netgate seem more focused on the fact that the code was being disparaged than its actual quality?

## Code quality

The first issue is whether Macy's code actually had significant problems. Donenfeld said that it did, and he [identified](https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2021-March/006494.html) a number of major issues:

* Sleep to mitigate race conditions
* Validation functions which simply return true
* Catastrophic cryptographic vulnerabilities
* Pieces of the wg protocol left unimplemented
* Kernel panics
* Security bypasses
* Printf statements deep in crypto code
* "Spectacular" buffer overflows
* Mazes of Linux→FreeBSD ifdefs

But Netgate argued that Donenfeld had gone overboard with his negative assessment. The original Macy code, they argued, was simply not that bad.

Despite not having any kernel developers on-staff, Ars was able to verify at least some of Donenfeld's claims directly, quickly, and without external assistance. For instance, finding a validation function which simply returned true—and `printf` statements buried deep in cryptographic loops—required nothing more complicated than `grep`.

### Empty validation function

In order to confirm or deny the claim of an empty validation function—one which always "returns true" rather than actually validating the data passed to it—we searched for instances of `return true` or `return (true)` in Macy's `if_wg` code, as checked into FreeBSD `13.0-HEAD`.

```
root@banshee:~/macy-freebsd-wg/sys/dev/if_wg# grep -ir 'return.*true' . | wc -l
21
```

This is a small enough number of returns to easily hand-audit, so we then used `grep` to find the same data but with three lines of code coming immediately before and after each `return true`:

```
root@banshee:~/macy-freebsd-wg/sys/dev/if_wg# grep -ir -A3 -B3 'return.*true' .
```

Among the valid uses of `return true`, we discovered one empty validation function, in `module/module.c`:

```
wg_allowedip_valid(const struct wg_allowedip *wip)
{

 return (true);
}
```

It's probably worth mentioning that this empty validation function is not buried at the bottom of a sprawling mass of code—`module.c` as written is only 863 total lines of code.

We did not attempt to chase down the use of this function any further, but it appears to be intended to check whether a packet's source and/or destination belongs to WireGuard's `allowed-ips` list, which determines what packets may be routed down a given WireGuard tunnel.

### Printf in crypto loops

Some pfSense 2.5.0 users [reported](https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/11339) strange hexadecimal output spamming the root console of their router. This matches Donenfeld's description of printf statements deep in crypto code, and we were able to easily discover the source in much the same way we found the empty validation function above.

```
root@banshee:~/macy-freebsd-wg/sys/dev/if_wg# grep -ir printf . | wc -l
68
root@banshee:~/macy-freebsd-wg/sys/dev/if_wg# grep -ir printf module/crypto | wc -l
7
root@banshee:~/macy-freebsd-wg/sys/dev/if_wg# grep -ir printf module/crypto/zinc/chacha20poly1305.c
		printf("src_len too short\n");
		printf("calculated: %16D\n", b.mac, "");
		printf("sent      : %16D\n", src + dst_len, "");

root@banshee:~/macy-freebsd-wg/sys/dev/if_wg# grep -ir -A3 -B3 'printf("calc' module/crypto/zinc/chacha20poly1305.c
	if (likely(!ret))
		chacha20(&chacha20_state, dst, src, dst_len, simd_context);
	else {
		printf("calculated: %16D\n", b.mac, "");
		printf("sent      : %16D\n", src + dst_len, "");
	}
	memzero_explicit(&chacha20_state, sizeof(chacha20_state));

```

In mostly backend code like a WireGuard implementation, `printf` statements in general are a bit of a red flag. There's obviously nothing explicitly wrong or unsafe about emitting text to the console—but it's something that's generally done rarely. One of the most frequent uses of `printf` in this scenario is temporary debugging, when a developer is trying to figure out what's going wrong during the process of writing code.

Usually, when you're done with a bout of this "printf debugging," you remove the `printf` statements you were using to check data values along the way—and it's not uncommon to specifically `grep` for stray instances of `printf` when a piece of code is finished and ready for production, just to make certain you've cleaned up after yourself.

The stray `printf` statements we found in Macy's `chacha20poly1305.c` are clearly just such an example of temporary debugging code. By themselves, they're a mild issue—indicative mostly of sloppiness in getting a piece of code ready for prime-time production use. The fact that those statements are still being triggered frequently *in* production use is a more serious issue—indicative of likely problems in the crypto implementation itself.

### A spectacular buffer overflow

Jim Salter

There are multiple buffer overflows present in Macy's `if_wg` implementation, with varying preconditions necessary to exploit them. The first one we became aware of exploits a failure of Macy's code to anticipate the use of jumbo frames.

In most Ethernet networks, the MTU—[Maximum Transmission Unit](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Maximum_transmission_unit), which roughly speaking is the largest allowable packet size—is either 1,492 bytes or 1,500 bytes. The term [Jumbo frames](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Jumbo_frame) is a human-friendly way to describe frames larger than 1,500 bytes. In networks that need extremely high throughput, configuring jumbo frames—most commonly, up to 9,000 bytes—is a way to increase throughput significantly by decreasing the packet count necessary to transmit a given (presumably large) volume of data.

Macy's code does not take the possibility of jumbo frame configuration into account and blindly allocates a 2,048 byte chunk of kernel memory to fit a packet in. With a typical MTU of 1500, this is sufficient. But when jumbo frames are configured, the packets overrun this 2,048 byte buffer and overwrite sensitive kernel memory.

When we first witnessed this bug demonstrated, the kernel crashed after a few hundred 3,000 byte pings. In the interest of getting a more concise set of screenshots, we used a 64K MTU, and a 64,000 byte packet—and panicked the kernel immediately, on the first ping.

This obviously represents a DoS (Denial of Service) vulnerability—after a kernel panic, a router will generally be out of service until a human operator manually reboots it. (It's also possible, but unlikely and typically considered a very bad idea, to configure the system to reboot on panic rather than hanging.)

Although this is the most "spectacular" buffer overflow we've seen in the code, there are others—some of which do not require configuration of jumbo frames at all.

### The rest of the laundry list

Ars Technica isn't *Kernel Debugging Quarterly*, so we'll leave the rest of the listed quality issues to others. FreeBSD developer Kyle Evans himself verified several of the others, including `sleep` to mitigate race conditions and at least one security bypass. Other developers and researchers pointed out several other problems privately, including questionable and difficult-to-maintain uses of `ifdef`.

We also found license problems in `if_wg`—code in the Linux kernel is licensed GPL v2.0, while code in the FreeBSD kernel must be licensed with weak permissive licenses such as BSD or MIT only. The `crypto_xor` routine Macy lifted from Linux's kernel does not appear to be properly licensed for use in FreeBSD.

In fairness to Macy, this is an easy mistake to make—and it would be an easy one to forgive if Netgate employee and FreeBSD committer Scott Long hadn't just raked Donenfeld over the coals for a similar error regarding Netgate's [copyright](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/dev-commits-src-all/2021-March/004403.html):

> The Netgate copyright was unilaterally removed. Yes, it was re-instated a few minutes ago, and with good reason. Please don’t do that again.
>
> ... An accusation was made, again tonight, that Netgate merely paid to benchmark the code, that we contributed nothing to it, and that it’s bad code that can’t be audited. What I see is that the meat of the implementation is copyrighted by Jason and others. There’s a modest but non-trivial amount of glue code that has (or had) the Netgate copyright. I’m not going to touch the audit nonsense.

(**Update:**Donenfeld points out [in the comments](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/03/buffer-overruns-license-violations-and-bad-code-freebsd-13s-close-call/?comments=1&post=39772350#comment-39772350) that Netgate's copyright was only missing temporarily while inside a local staging repo with "a ton of churn"—not from any commit to an official FreeBSD repository.)

The big takeaway here is that whatever you think of any one developer's diplomacy and tact, this code was not in a condition ready for production use on a global scale—which is exactly where it was headed.

Netgate had already implemented Macy's `if_wg` in its pfSense router distribution despite its non-production, release candidate status in FreeBSD—and there was no indication that the FreeBSD community (which includes many Netgate employees) would have caught the issues itself without outside intervention.

## Poor code wasn’t par for the course

Was this sort of code consistent with developer Matthew Macy's ability and history, or was it an outlier? Why was Netgate so focused on getting his implementation into the FreeBSD kernel—and into pfSense—despite obvious, easily discoverable indicators of its low quality? And what, if any, procedures were in place that might have caught such issues prior to `if_wg` going out into the world in FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE?

We weren't specifically familiar with Macy's prior work—and when we began digging, we discovered Macy's criminal history in San Francisco more easily than his coding history. That partially answered the question of why Macy's work had been difficult to unearth—he's only been known professionally as Matthew Macy for a few years. Armed with both of his professional names, we were able to begin finding answers—Macy has been involved directly and substantially with many high-level and well-regarded projects over the years.

Those projects include multiple network drivers and a driver abstraction library. This qualified him more substantially to write a WireGuard port—WireGuard presents as a virtual network interface, no different in theory from a physical one. But that also made some of his errors even more puzzling—an experienced network interface developer should never have hard-coded packet sizes, leading to the horrendous buffer overflow we demonstrated above.

Interviewing other prominent developers who worked with Macy on those projects proved more difficult. To his credit, Macy does not appear to have hidden his past from coworkers, and the few who would speak to us said he volunteered that information directly. But that same toxic past makes Macy a very touchy subject. Few of his prior co-workers would speak to us at all, and none were willing to go on the record.

Those who did speak described him as a talented, professional coder who produced no more bugs than most and responded well to code reviews and the need to squash bugs when identified. The condition of Macy's `if_wg` implementation came as a surprise to those who had worked with him in the past—sloppy, half-finished code wasn't simply par for the course when working with him.

Macy himself spoke to us via email over the course of several messages. He initially seemed focused on deflecting challenges to the quality of his code, making accusations that Ars had simply taken Donenfeld's word about all the problems. When we pointed out that we had independently verified many of those claims—and included the simple `grep` commands necessary to verify them—Macy became more forthcoming, although he was still aggrieved, saying:

> That's nice. What were you doing the months it was up for review? (sarcasm) [...] This points more to the absence of quality reviewers.

This is when he described a situation full of personal stress and admitted that his final effort had been "half-hearted."

But Macy went on to recount an impressive number of projects he's been a key contributor to in the past, and he concluded:

> Which is all to say that you've indirectly called in to question the integrity of large chunks of the [FreeBSD] kernel.

Macy appears to have intended this statement as an attack—but it's actually a reasonable point.

The kernel's integrity isn't in question simply because of Macy's skills, ethics, or even criminal history. As he himself noted, the real issue is an absence of quality reviewers. More importantly, there seems to be an absence of process to *ensure* quality code review.

Still, in a further email, Macy argued that the grass is no greener on the other side:

> While we definitely fell down to some degree in this particular case, I think you may be overestimating what review catches immediately. There's a reason why many large orgs are still on (for example) Linux 4.9 and many much older. Every version of Linux I've run has had weird crashes.

## Netgate responds

We wanted to know how such a developer had produced uncharacteristically poor code—but we also wanted to know why it had been so thoroughly championed by Netgate, even when its problems were placed under a spotlight. We also wanted to know why FreeBSD itself seemed to be merely trailing in Netgate's wake.

In [emails](https://lists.zx2c4.com/pipermail/wireguard/2021-March/006499.html) to Donenfeld, blog [posts](https://www.netgate.com/blog/painful-lessons-learned-in-security-and-community.html) at Netgate, and emails to FreeBSD mailing lists, Netgate employee Scott Long seemed to shift seamlessly from speaking in proprietary ways about pfSense—Netgate's FreeBSD-based router distribution—and FreeBSD itself:

> I’ve also spoken with the FreeBSD Security Officer, and we’ve agreed that wireguard will be removed from all branches of FreeBSD until further notice. I’ve also informed Kyle of this. I do not support its reintroduction into FreeBSD, whether in the src tree or in the ports tree, at this time. As for pfSense, we are conducting an audit and will decide on the best course of action for our customers and our company.

This declaration comes hot on the heels of an accusation, in the same email, of irresponsibly dropping "zero-day" vulnerabilities:

> What you and Kyle did was tell the world that there are a number of zero-day exploits in the code. You gave us no details until after the fact, gave us no time to mitigate, correct, and publish before your announcement and Kyle's code drop, and used the opportunity to bash the code, and by extension us, for your own self-gain.

In the context of FreeBSD, however, these vulnerabilities weren't "zero-day" at all—they were found in beta code, existing in a Release Candidate build which would *become* production code on March 30 if not addressed before then. From Netgate's perspective, they were "zero-day" because Netgate backported this beta code into pfSense 2.5.0, released in mid-February.

> Look if you're trying to integrate your broken code into an upstream project and someone says "this is broken" then complaining that you've already deployed your broken code elsewhere isn't a reason for them to give you a break

> — Matthew Garrett (@mjg59@nondeterministic.computer) (@mjg59) [March 16, 2021](https://twitter.com/mjg59/status/1371957121395257345?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw)

As prominent Linux developer Matthew Garrett points out above, this was FreeBSD kernel code—and it was not in production status there. This struck us as evidence that the delineation between Long's role as FreeBSD committer and Netgate employee—and possibly between Netgate's own roles as private company and FreeBSD sponsor—might need more clarification.

To investigate further, we spoke on the record with Netgate CEO Jim Thompson, and Netgate Director of Development / FreeBSD committer Scott Long.

**Ars:**"Can you describe the relationship between Netgate and the FreeBSD core team and foundation?

**Thompson:** The relationship is that Netgate has two software products and one of them is based on FreeBSD. And in that, they're the vendor for FreeBSD. We have a product based on FreeBSD. There are several employees here, employees or contractors, who are or have been on [FreeBSD] core. There's almost a Chinese wall between activities at Netgate and their activities.

**Ars:** OK. Do your employees who do work with FreeBSD receive any kind of training or guidance on how to separate their roles as FreeBSD people and as Netgate employees?

**Thompson:** There actually are explicit requirements in the employee contract that separate Netgate from FreeBSD. However, it's understood that there could be... We're trying to eliminate any kind of influence which is, I think, what you're trying to imply. What they do with FreeBSD and their roles as core committers is them on their own time. That's not a form or function of their employment with Netgate.

**Long:** So I'll say that being a member of the core team gives me no special privileges to add onto the code, and my voice is one of many. I'm a very small voice in the leadership. I'm a small voice in the community. The structure of FreeBSD is much more flat than in, say, Linux. Everyone has some control and privileges and equal access. But that doesn't mean that any one person is liable to run roughshod or to push their agenda without oversight. The FreeBSD community is very much built on oversight. Very much built on pretty strict distribution of authority and responsibility. And like I said, I'm just one small voice."

Although Long describes himself as "one small voice" inside a system built on "strict distribution of authority and responsibility," his voice was very nearly the only one heard on the subject of this code. Long has seemed concerned with shouting down potential challenges to the quality of pfSense rather than to finding and fixing potential problems in FreeBSD's kernel. We see this in a Netgate official [blog post](https://www.netgate.com/blog/painful-lessons-learned-in-security-and-community.html) he wrote to pfSense customers:

> **Right now, we have not found any issues that would result in a remote or unprivileged vulnerability for pfSense users who are running Wireguard**. We’ve identified several low-risk issues that are unlikely to be exploitable, except by an attacker who has already compromised the admin permissions of the system. Also, the use of Jumbo Frames appears to be problematic...

When Ars pushed Thompson and Long on this claim in the interview—using the kernel-panicking ping above as a counterpoint—their response was heated. Thompson claimed it was "not an exploit" and that an attacker would "need admin privileges" to exploit it.

Both claims seem suspect. Denial of Service is an entire [category](https://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/opdos-1/denial-of-service.html) of CVE, and an attacker does not need admin privileges in order to exploit this one—the admin merely needs to have made the mistake of configuring a tunnel with jumbo frames enabled.

Long pointed out that his blog post then declared that jumbo frames "appear to be problematic"—but this is thin gruel indeed. "Problematic" is an awfully vague description, and it followed a bold-faced declaration that the code has "no issues that would result in [a] vulnerability."

## The response from FreeBSD Core

Where was the FreeBSD Core team while all this was happening? We reached out to them, including directly addressing many of the group's most prominent committers, at the same time that we requested an interview from Netgate.

Several FreeBSD community members would only speak off the record. In essence, most seem to agree, you either have a commit bit (enabling you to commit code to FreeBSD's repositories) or you don't. It's hard to find code reviews, and there generally isn't a fixed process ensuring that vitally important code *gets* reviewed prior to inclusion. This system thus relies heavily on the ability and collegiality of individual code creators.

In a FreeBSD mailing list [posting](https://lists.freebsd.org/pipermail/dev-commits-src-main/2021-March/002847.html), developer Alexey Dokuchaev points out that Macy closed code review tasks without actually completing them:

> ... my questions to mmacy@ about original wireguard commit (and ZoL, FWIW) or Phabricator comments had not been answered; I also recall reviews being closed in "not accepted" state by him. While I appreciate the heavy-lifting, developers should be ready to explain and sometimes defend their work on public forums.

The FreeBSD Core team did not respond to Ars' requests for comment for several days. The response, when it finally came, said:

> Core unconditionally values the work of all contributors, and seeks a culture of cooperation, respect, and collaboration. The public discourse over WireGuard in the past week does not meet these standards and is damaging to our community if not checked. As such, WireGuard development for FreeBSD will now proceed outside of the base system. For those who wish to evaluate, test, or experiment with WireGuard, snapshots will be available via the ports and package systems.
>
> As a project, we remain committed to continually improving our development process. We’ll also continue to refine our tooling to make code reviews and continuous integration easier and more effective. The Core Team asks that the community use these tools and work together to improve FreeBSD.

## Concluding a difficult saga

FreeBSD is an [important](https://docs.freebsd.org/en/books/handbook/introduction/#nutshell) project that deserves to be taken seriously. Its downstream consumers include industry giants such as Cisco, Juniper, NetApp, Netflix, Sony, Sophos, and more. The difference in licensing between FreeBSD and Linux gives FreeBSD a reach into many projects and spaces where the Linux kernel would be a difficult or impossible fit.

Neither Netgate's responses, FreeBSD Core's, nor the off-record responses we heard from independent FreeBSD community members lead us to believe that there was in fact any process in place that could reasonably have been expected to catch this issue prior to it going out into the world in 13.0-RELEASE.

We take some heart in the fact that FreeBSD Core team's expressed a commitment to improving processes, refining tooling, and making code reviews more effective—but it's impossible to ignore the fact that this commitment comes as an afterthought to attacking "public discourse" that highlighted the need for those improved processes, refined tools, and more effective reviews in the first place.

You can follow the expected [launch](https://www.freebsd.org/releases/13.0R/schedule/) of FreeBSD 13.0-RELEASE—without WireGuard—on March 30.

WireGuard probably won't make it into 13.0-RELEASE, but 13.1 seems very likely.

# TrueNAS SCALE Overview

![Open Storage that Scales](https://www.truenas.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Open-Storage-That-Scales-Graphic-2024_805x453px.png "Open Storage That Scales Graphic 2024_805x453px")

### Open Storage that Scales

TrueNASÂ® SCALE is an Open Source Infrastructure solution. In addition to powerful scale-out storage capabilities, SCALE adds Linux Containers and VMs (KVM) so your organization can run workloads closer to data.

### Scale-Up or Scale-Out

OpenZFS with its excellent data management capabilities is the basis for all deployments. Scale-up by adding drives, or deploy scale-out object storage by adding multiple systems to a cluster. Deploy a single host in your home/office, or group nodes together for a highly scalable and highly available software-defined infrastructure.

![Scale-Up or Scale-Out](https://www.truenas.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/OpenZFSMinio_Graphic_2024_805x453px.png "OpenZFS+Minio_Graphic_2024_805x453px")

![Go Beyond Storage](https://www.truenas.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Native_Containers_Graphic_2024_805x453px.png "Native_Containers_Graphic_2024_805x453px")

### Go Beyond Storage

TrueNAS SCALE allows you to easily customize and expand functionality with a variety of free [Apps](https://www.truenas.com/apps/), like Plex Media Server, NextCloud, Prometheus, Elastic Search, Emby, and many others. It also provides simple access to the well-established Linux container ecosystem, with support for KVM virtual machines, Kubernetes, and Docker containers.

### Join Millions in the TrueNAS Community

With a global community of testers and contributors, the TrueNAS Open Source development model enables broader testing, and ultimately, a higher quality product, in addition to its unbeaten value. Join the âStorage Freedomâ movement and enjoy the benefits of Open Source economics.

![Built on Open Source](https://www.truenas.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/Built_On_Open_Source_Graphic_805x453px.png "Built_On_Open_Source_Graphic_805x453px")

![TrueCommand_UI_Monitor_Mockup](https://www.truenas.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/07/TrueCommand_UI_Monitor_Mockup-1.png "TrueCommand_UI_Monitor_Mockup")

### Manage Storage Clusters and Fleets

Cluster many systems together with SCALE and manage them all with [TrueCommand](/truecommand/). TrueCommand makes it easy to monitor and administer all of your systems from a single, easy-to-use dashboard.

### Appliances & Support for Important Workloads

If your data is critical or you simply need professional support, [TrueNAS Enterprise](https://www.truenas.com/truenas-enterprise/) and the full line of [TrueNAS storage](https://www.truenas.com/systems-overview/) appliances provide enhanced features and the around-the-clock support necessary to keep your storage online.

## Statistics

Google collects statistics about IPv6 adoption in the Internet on an ongoing basis. We
hope that publishing this information will help Internet providers, website owners, and
policy makers as the industry rolls out IPv6.

* [IPv6 Adoption](#ipv6-adoption)
* [Per-Country IPv6 adoption](#per-country-ipv6-adoption)

#### IPv6 Adoption

We are continuously measuring the availability of IPv6 connectivity among Google
users. The graph shows the percentage of users that access Google over IPv6.

#### Per-Country IPv6 adoption

World | Africa | Asia | Europe | Oceania | North America |
Central America | Caribbean | South America

The chart above shows the availability of IPv6 connectivity around the world.

* Regions where IPv6 is more widely deployed (the darker the green, the greater
  the deployment) and users experience infrequent issues connecting to
  IPv6-enabled websites.
* Regions where IPv6 is more widely deployed but users still experience
  significant reliability or latency issues connecting to IPv6-enabled websites.
* Regions where IPv6 is not widely deployed and users experience significant
  reliability or latency issues connecting to IPv6-enabled websites.

# Netgate / pfSense acts in bad faith

### WIPO decides in favour of OPNsense

---

![](https://opnsense.org/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/pexels-photo-534204-300x167.jpg)
### Some of you may have come across OPNsense.com a domain that until  September 21, 2017 was home to a controversial website with content targeted to harm our open source project.

### On the fore mentioned date we filed a complaint with WIPO, the World Intellectual Property Organization to try and stop this website from being operated.

#####

---

### Until our legal action we were unable to determine the owner of the domains as it was registered using Domains By Proxy, LLC, however we believed the site was created by a pfSense enthusiast who had gone a step too far.

### Much to our surprise we received an email on September 26, 2017 stating that the owner of this domain was in fact Jamie Thompson, Rubicon Communications dba Netgate also known for the competing pfSense project.

### Maybe this should not have come as a surprise as ever since we created OPNsense they have tried to harm our project and aided in spreading false information, mostly done using anonymous accounts. Their aim has been to scare off new users and keep our project from Wikipedia, this way depriving others from making their own choice.

### Their actions have been bad for the open source community as they undermine the very basic principles of open source.

### Today we have been able to stop Netgate and although we are glad this chapter can be closed, it does not feel like a victory at all  as the time, effort and money could have been spend much better.

### The full text of the WIPO panel’s decision on OPNsense.com can be found here: <http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=D2017-1828>

### The content of OPNsense.com prior to our action can still be seen on the WayBackMachine, the internet archive (beware it contains shocking material):  [http://web.archive.org/web/20160314132836/http://www.opnsense.com/](http://web.archive.org/web/20160314132836/http%3A/www.opnsense.com/)

### The video that was not cached contains scenes taken from the film “Downfall”, the historical war drama film depicting the final ten days of Adolf Hitler's rule over Nazi Germany, along with a comment reading “From deep within the OPNsense development bunker”.

### As Deciso, the company behind OPNsense we have not yet decided upon further action, but ask all who read this to push back to those who try to harm our community and open source in general.

### As a final note, we wish to thank everyone for their overwhelming supporting and are proud to have witnessed the positive development of the project as a whole, a rapidly growing community and the next major release 18.1 almost at our doorstep.

###

### Stay safe,Your OPNsense team

## [Ok, Ok, I'm Turning uPnP off.](/turning-upnp-off/)

6 April, 2021

I recently wrote a blog post concerning my discovery that my [NAS had decided to expose itself all over the internet](https://kn100.me/terramaster-nas-exposing-itself-over-upnp/). If you haven’t seen that, it’s probably worth reading first. That post took off in a way I wasn’t quite expecting, and of course I didn’t quite dot my Is and cross my T’s as well as I should have, leading to a fair bit of misunderstanding in the HN post that initially kicked all this off. Hopefully I can address some of this here. I certainly didn’t think this would [get a CVE](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-30127)!

![A graph showing the number of visitors to my blog, showing a significant uptick when the last blog post was published](/posts/upnp-off/turning-upnp-off-3.png)

Firstly, I’ll recount my contact with Terramaster. On Feb 21st 2021 I contacted Terramaster informing them of the issue. I contacted them again soon after again letting them know that changing the web server port does not help. I then contacted them a third time letting them know that this could be fixed fairly easily with a simple change to `/etc/upnp.json` as I mentioned in my previous post.

Terramaster replied on Feb 22nd saying they’d get someone to look into it, but also stated that this was intentional behavior:

> Hello Kevin,
>
> Thank you for contacting TerraMaster.
>
> As for the mentioned security issue, it has been transferred to the R&D department, they will test here and fix it if it’s confirmed.
>
> For port 8181 and 5443, it’s opened by default for it’s the default port of TOS webpage access.

I replied:

> Hi,
>
> Thanks for the confirmation that somebody will look into this.
>
> Opening these ports via UPNP is not necessary for local access, and in fact makes the port accessible worldwide, externally.
>
> I can also access my NAS via http://some-public-ip:8181 - on the public internet.
>
> I hope that makes things clearer. Please me me know if you decide to change this behavior and if you do plan to fix this, please let me know what kind of timeline you’re working to. I’d like to publish a blog post about this (specifically around the danger of UPNP) once you’re happy everything is secure.

I then made the blog post 6 weeks later, hoping it might motivate them into fixing it. It sparked a lot of interesting discussion on [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26681984) and [Reddit /r/datahoarder](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/mk3l0i/terramaster_nas_exposing_itself_with_upnp_over/). It blew up way bigger than I expected, and is by far the best performing blog post I’ve written. Pretty sad considering I threw it together in under an hour and didn’t even spell check it!

The issue specifically is that while the NAS claims its web interface is only locally accessible, it is actually accessible from anywhere in the world to anyone who knows the public IP of the network it is sitting on. This is because most consumer grade routers like the one I use have a feature called uPnP, which allows applications on your internal network to punch open ports that they need to operate. This feature is supposed to be useful for things like VOIP applications and gaming. The NAS for some reason decided to punch itself some ports open so that it could be internet accessible.

An interesting detail is that it punched more ports than you’d expect. It punched the default port that the web interface runs on (8181), a port for an SSL configured web server (5443), and then it also punches ports for 9091, as well as port 8800, which I’m not sure what the purpose is. My guess is that these ports were being used by a Terramaster developer, and they didn’t bother to remove the config to punch them before releasing the software.

Some suggested I just disable uPnP on my router, but I personally believe this kind of misses the point. I am a software engineer who regularly dabbles in infrastructure, and therefore could reasonably be expected to figure out how to disable uPnP. Thinking about the average consumer, who wouldn’t have any idea what port forwarding or uPnP is, I’m not so sure they could. Disabling uPnP definitely closes this particular security hole, but the vast majority of consumer routers are going to have this feature on, and therefore the vast majority of these NAS products in the wild are likely exposing themselves unwittingly. I am hoping that Terramaster will fix this issue in their product, and therefore unwitting users who aren’t aware of what uPnP is suddenly find themselves more secure, assuming they update!

Others suggest buying a new router which would support having two separate LAN networks so that this gear could be put on a LAN that is denied direct access to the internet/not have uPnP. This again I don’t see regular consumers doing en masse. I could do it, and very well may in the future, but I don’t really feel the need to upgrade my networking gear currently. It works, and I am happy with it.

This is why I went spelunking into the device itself. Thankfully Terramaster provides root on these boxes, which is nice of them. This led me to discover the fix I did.

Either way, one detail I got the most comments about was whether disabling uPnP was really a hit to convenience. Somebody emailed me questioning this specifically, as well as pointing out that [GRC has a check](https://www.grc.com/default.htm) to make sure your router isn’t allowing services on the internet to punch open ports on your router to hosts behind it. I had no idea this was a problem, and facepalmed pretty hard that this ever was, but nevertheless I replied:

> If I’m being totally honest with you, this was more of a ‘feeling’ than it was an analytical decision. I should have known better than to assume I’d get away with that in a blog post like this, but I wasn’t quite expecting it to blow up the way it did!
>
> I am reasonably confident in my router *(author sidenote: lol)*, it’s actually not the trashiest ISP provisioned router I’ve ever had and the GRC uPnP exposure check is not flagging anything up.
>
> I am strongly considering writing a blog post in future addressing this though - essentially my plan is to disable uPnP without making any other changes and seeing what breaks, if anything. It is completely possible I am very wrong that this is necessary these days. I am already port forwarding certain stuff I need externally accessible, but I’d be curious if the various consumer level stuff I’ve got floating around manages to keep working.
>
> Thanks for contacting me!

So here I am, money where my mouth is. I’ve disabled uPnP and NAT-PMP on my router entirely.

![A screenshot showing both UPnP and NAT-PMP being disabled in my router](/posts/upnp-off/turning-upnp-off-1.png)

Turning uPnP off led to some rather amusing error messages in my routers debug log

![A screenshot of some error messages which read 'Why did you run me anyway?, could not open lease file: /var/upnp.leases, Reloading rules from lease file'](/posts/upnp-off/turning-upnp-off-2.png)

I’ll come back to this in a months time and see whether there has really been a hit to ‘convenience’ or whether I was truly wrong on this. I’m always happy to learn!

| --- | --- |
| Internet Connection | The status of the Internet connection. |
| PlayStationÂ Network Sign-In | The status of your PlayStation™Network sign-in. |
| NAT Type | How your PS4® system is connected to the Internet This information can be used to judge the ease or difficulty of connecting to other PS4® systems, such as when using communication features of games. Type 1: The system is connected directly to the Internet. Type 2: The system is connected to the Internet with a router. Type 3: The system is connected to the Internet with a router. With Type 3, communication with other PS4® systems might be impossible, or your PS4® system's network features might be limited. For details, see â[When you cannot connect to PlayStation™Network](#ID39017)â. |
| Connection Speed (Download)\* | The estimated speed that your PS4® system can receive data from the Internet. |
| Connection Speed (Upload)\* | The estimated speed that your PS4® system can send data to the Internet. |

\*
Connection speeds are estimates only. Actual speeds may vary depending on the connected servers and network traffic.

If the connection fails, follow the on-screen instructions to view the settings. Refer to the instructions supplied with the network device in use, and information from your Internet service provider.

## When you cannot connect to PlayStation™Network

Use PlayStation™Network to connect your PS4® system to a PlayStation™Network server or to another PS4® system. When you're using PlayStation™Network at an office or other location with a shared network, a firewall or other security measures might prevent your PS4® system from connecting to PlayStation™Network. If this occurs, refer to the port numbers listed below, which are used when you connect your PS4® system to a PlayStation™Network server.

* TCP: 80, 443, 3478, 3479, 3480
* UDP: 3478, 3479

For online activities such as competing with other players while your system is connected directly to other PS4® systems, a different port number is used each time you connect.

Communication might be restricted depending on the security functions provided by your router or Internet service provider. Refer to the instructions supplied with the network device in use, and information from your Internet service provider.

How customer reviews and ratings work

Customer Reviews, including Product Star Ratings help customers to learn more about the product and decide whether it is the right product for them.

To calculate the overall star rating and percentage breakdown by star, we don’t use a simple average. Instead, our system considers things like how recent a review is and if the reviewer bought the item on Amazon. It also analyzed reviews to verify trustworthiness.

##### Works much better than the alternatives around the same price

I made the mistake of buying the Syba card that performs the same function (Internal 2x SAS for 8 SATA channels) as this. DO NOT BUY THAT card, get this card. This card has had zero issues with setting up drives or detecting them and the performance of this card is much better. Don't try to save the $35 or how ever much it is, the cheap Syba card is not worth the trouble.Tested with Crystal disk, Read Only Peak performance profile.Array is 4x 1TB BX550 Solid state drives using Microsoft Storage Spaces and ReFS in Parity mode~1.4 GB/s peak, 420 MB/sec in the 4k Random test, 102k IOPSMoreHide

  I replaced a basic SATA card with this SAS card because the SATA card was acting flaky. That's what I get for the price.

  ##### [*5.0 out of 5 stars* A good SAS card](/gp/customer-reviews/R3PUHOF72HSG4P/ref%3Dcm_cr_dp_d_rvw_ttl?ie=UTF8&ASIN=B008J49G9A)

  Reviewed in the United States on June 14, 2023[Verified Purchase](/gp/help/customer/display.html/ref%3Dcm_cr_dp_d_rvw_avp?nodeId=G8UYX7LALQC8V9KA)
  What we have here is an affordable SAS card, which means Serial Attached SCSI for those that do not know what SAS means (affordable means less than 100.00 USD). Mine came in a clamshell like packaging with no box. They claim that these cards are new, it's hard to tell as mine came in with all the labels and such intact (Some have reported that theirs appeared used).

  Further research of these cards yields (Google "LSI SAS2 2308 Mustang" - Which is what device manager sees this card as) that this is an OEM card, as I found the drivers for this card on a Dell support website as well as the HP support website (the latest drivers I could find for this card were Windows 8.1). This is not a bad thing, keep in mind that SAS cards can be very expensive if you were to buy these at retail as SAS is aimed more at the IT/Enterprise market. However also keep in mind that you MAY not be able to get Support from LSI (Broadcom) if this card were to fail on you. I'm not sure what kind of support you will get from the vendor other than the standard return to Amazon (if purchased from a fulfilled by Amazon, which is what I would recommend).

  What is the difference between SAS and SATA?
  In short, research has suggested that SAS has an advantage when it comes to multiple people accessing data on disk, SAS can both send and receive data at the same time while SATA cannot (SATA can only send or receive at once). Which means SAS is a good option for people looking to build a NAS system, but you MUST use SAS drives, if you use SATA to SAS cables, you are limited to SATA.

  Should I buy this card?
  If you are looking to add more SATA drives to your computer or want to build an affordable SAS NAS system, then yes.

  If you are looking for something faster than SATA, then a PCI Express to NVMe card might be a better option for you.

  The Good:
  Very affordable SAS card, SAS is a far more superior standard than SATA and is backwards compatible with SATA. Search Mini SAS to SATA on Amazon for adaptors. Yes, this has Mini SAS connectors on it also if you were wondering. LSI (its Broadcom now) if you are watching, there IS a market for affordable new SAS cards.

  Windows and Linux compatible, can't comment on Mac support. Tried on Windows 11 and Fedora

  Can support 8 Drives. Good for a NAS setup.

  The BAD:
   - This is not a Raid compatible card, it's called a HBA (Host bus adaptor), which means there is NO hardware raid capabilities on this card, not really a bad thing as there is plenty of software solutions around this, Windows, and Linux both have software implementations. I can't comment on if there is a speed difference between Software and hardware RAID.

  - It is only 6GB/s card, plenty good for the home market, not much faster than current SATA (see the difference between SAS and SATA). 12 GB/s and 22 GB/s are more recent standards, probably very expensive.

   - Support on this card is iffy at best, haven't had to use it yet.

   - SAS drives can be expensive.

  Conclusion:
  If you're wanting to make a NAS machine or simply add more SATA disk drives, then this is the card for you. It's much better than those cheap SATA cards out there and gives you a pathway to start using SAS drives in your computer or NAS.

  Overall, I'm very happy with this card.

  This is being used on an old Z170 Intel chipset to add extra SATA ports for a "RAID5" aka Windows 10 Parity storage space for 5, 6TB NAS rated HDDs. Unlike the simple "add SATA port" cards that only relocated the motherboard SATA ports to that card, this actually adds additional SATA ports.

  In my case, I moved the HDDs from the motherboard to this card. The drives previously used the Intel RAID5 BIOS. That provided a large 512 byte sector drive. However, to add a 2TB M2 drive I needed to use two of the SATA ports, thus the reason for this addition.

  I used Macrium Reflect to backup all the BIOS drives before the change to an external 20TB USB drive. I then restored the 1TB C boot drive along with the hidden repair partitions to the M2 drive. However, I did run into an issue restoring the large Z 20TB drive, as this new Windows partition used 8k blocks instead of 512. Thankfully Macrium lets you mount the Image as a read only drive, and as this was just used for data, there was no issue for special permissions. I then used Windows copy to copy from that image drive to the new Z drive. After a few days, it completed successfully.

  After a week it is working flawlessly. For the price it is the best solution I could come up for more SATA ports.

  Purchased this as part of my latest unraid server build. It was super easy and straight forward (plug and play) to install on the mobo, and connect up the 8 HDDs. I would honestly like to see this card closer to $100, but it's still great.

  Would recommend! I'm actually already considering an upgrade to the big brother version with 4 connectors since my server case has 15 drive slots...but for the time being I'll just make due with the remaining available mobo SATA connectors.

From Wikipedia, the free encyclopedia

Russian proverb
For the Arrow episode, see [Trust But Verify](/wiki/Trust_But_Verify "Trust But Verify").

**Trust, but verify** (Russian: доверяй, но проверяй, [romanized](/wiki/Romanization_of_Russian "Romanization of Russian"): *doveryay, no proveryay*, IPA: [[dəvʲɪˈrʲæj no prəvʲɪˈrʲæj]](/wiki/Help%3AIPA/Russian "Help:IPA/Russian")) is a [Russian proverb](/wiki/Russian_proverb "Russian proverb"), which rhymes in Russian. The phrase became internationally known in English after [Suzanne Massie](/wiki/Suzanne_Massie "Suzanne Massie"), a scholar of Russian history, taught it to [Ronald Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan"), then [president of the United States](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States"), who used it on several occasions in the context of [nuclear disarmament](/wiki/Nuclear_disarmament "Nuclear disarmament") discussions with the [Soviet Union](/wiki/Soviet_Union "Soviet Union").

## Soviet–American relations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trust,_but_verify&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Soviet–American relations")]
[![](//upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/b/bf/President_Ronald_Reagan_and_Mikhail_Gorbachev_during_the_second_plenary_session.jpg/220px-President_Ronald_Reagan_and_Mikhail_Gorbachev_during_the_second_plenary_session.jpg)](/wiki/File%3APresident_Ronald_Reagan_and_Mikhail_Gorbachev_during_the_second_plenary_session.jpg)

1985 Reagan–Gorbachev meeting at the [Geneva Summit](/wiki/Geneva_Summit_%281985%29 "Geneva Summit (1985)") in Switzerland

[Suzanne Massie](/wiki/Suzanne_Massie "Suzanne Massie"), an American scholar, met with [Ronald Reagan](/wiki/Ronald_Reagan "Ronald Reagan") many times between 1984 and 1987 while he was [President of the United States](/wiki/President_of_the_United_States "President of the United States").[[1]](#cite_note-1) She taught him the [Russian proverb](/wiki/Russian_proverb "Russian proverb") *doveryai, no proveryai* (доверяй, но проверяй) meaning 'trust, but verify'. She advised him that "The Russians like to talk in proverbs. It would be nice of you to know a few. You are an actor – you can learn them very quickly."[[2]](#cite_note-2) The proverb was adopted as a [signature phrase](/wiki/Catch_phrase "Catch phrase") by Reagan, who used it frequently when discussing United States relations with the Soviet Union.[[3]](#cite_note-bartons-3)[[4]](#cite_note-:0-4)[[5]](#cite_note-:Shevchenko-5)

After Reagan used the phrase to emphasize "the extensive verification procedures that would enable both sides to monitor compliance with the treaty",[[6]](#cite_note-NYT9dec1987-6) at the signing of the [Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty](/wiki/Intermediate-Range_Nuclear_Forces_Treaty "Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty"), on 8 December 1987, his counterpart General Secretary [Mikhail Gorbachev](/wiki/Mikhail_Gorbachev "Mikhail Gorbachev") responded, "You repeat that at every meeting". To this, Reagan answered, "I like it".[[3]](#cite_note-bartons-3)[[7]](#cite_note-7)[[8]](#cite_note-Watson2011-8) While Reagan quoted Russian proverbs, Gorbachev quoted [Ralph Waldo Emerson](/wiki/Ralph_Waldo_Emerson "Ralph Waldo Emerson"), who had been popular in the USSR when Gorbachev was in college, saying that "the reward of a thing well done is to have done it."[[4]](#cite_note-:0-4)[[6]](#cite_note-NYT9dec1987-6)

Following the [2013 Ghouta attacks](/wiki/2013_Ghouta_attacks "2013 Ghouta attacks"), Secretary of State [John Kerry](/wiki/John_Kerry "John Kerry") told a news conference in Geneva that the United States and Russia had agreed on a framework to dispose of Syria's chemical weapons. He said "President Reagan's old adage about 'trust but verify' ... is in need of an update. And we have committed here to a standard that says 'verify and verify'."[[9]](#cite_note-9)[[10]](#cite_note-10)

## Influence

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trust,_but_verify&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Influence")]

In 1995, the similar phrase "Trust and Verify" was used as the motto of the On-Site Inspection Agency (now subsumed into the [Defense Threat Reduction Agency](/wiki/Defense_Threat_Reduction_Agency "Defense Threat Reduction Agency")).[[11]](#cite_note-11)

In 2000, David T. Lindgren's book about how interpretation, or [imagery analysis](/wiki/Imagery_analysis "Imagery analysis"), of aerial and [satellite images](/wiki/Satellite_images "Satellite images") of the Soviet Union played a key role in [superpowers](/wiki/Superpower "Superpower") and in [arms control](/wiki/Arms_control "Arms control") during the [Cold War](/wiki/Cold_War "Cold War") was titled *Trust But Verify: Imagery Analysis in the Cold War*.[[12]](#cite_note-LindgrenNove2000-12)[[13]](#cite_note-reviewLindgrenNove2000-13)

In 2001, the [National Infrastructure Protection Center](/wiki/National_Infrastructure_Protection_Center "National Infrastructure Protection Center") (NIPC), a national critical infrastructure threat investigation and response entity, published a paper entitled "Trust but verify" on how to protect oneself and their company from email viruses.[[14]](#cite_note-email2001-14)

In 2015, both Democrats and Republicans invoked the phrase when arguing for and against the proposed [Iran nuclear deal framework](/wiki/Iran_nuclear_deal_framework "Iran nuclear deal framework").[[3]](#cite_note-bartons-3)

In the study of [programming languages](/wiki/Programming_languages "Programming languages"), the phrase has been used to describe the implementation of [downcasting](/wiki/Downcasting "Downcasting"): the compiler trusts that the downcast term will be of the desired type, but this assumption is verified at runtime in order to avoid undefined behavior.[[15]](#cite_note-15)

The phrase has been used in relation to India–China border disputes and also following the Galwan clash during the [2020 China–India skirmishes](/wiki/2020_China%E2%80%93India_skirmishes "2020 China–India skirmishes").[[16]](#cite_note-16) Variants of the phrase were also reported in the Indian media, "distrust until fully and comprehensively verified", and "verify and still not trust".[[17]](#cite_note-17)[[18]](#cite_note-18)[[19]](#cite_note-19)

On July 24, 2020, US Secretary of State [Michael Pompeo](/wiki/Michael_Pompeo "Michael Pompeo") referenced the proverb in a speech at the [Richard Nixon Presidential Library](/wiki/Richard_Nixon_Presidential_Library_and_Museum "Richard Nixon Presidential Library and Museum") saying that in dealing with China, the [United States](/wiki/United_States "United States") must instead "distrust and verify".[[20]](#cite_note-20)[[21]](#cite_note-21)

## Origins

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Trust,_but_verify&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Origins")]

Nikolay Shevchenko of [Russia Beyond](/wiki/Russia_Beyond "Russia Beyond") writes that this saying must have been originated relatively recently. For example [Vladimir Dal](/wiki/Vladimir_Dal "Vladimir Dal")'s vast collection *[Sayings and Bywords of the Russian people](/w/index.php?title=Sayings_and_Bywords_of_the_Russian_people&action=edit&redlink=1 "Sayings and Bywords of the Russian people (page does not exist)") [[ru](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%9F%D0%BE%D1%81%D0%BB%D0%BE%D0%B2%D0%B8%D1%86%D1%8B_%D1%80%D1%83%D1%81%D1%81%D0%BA%D0%BE%D0%B3%D0%BE_%D0%BD%D0%B0%D1%80%D0%BE%D0%B4%D0%B0 "ru:Пословицы русского народа")]* does not contain anything similar to the proverb. He noticed that both [Vladimir Lenin](/wiki/Vladimir_Lenin "Vladimir Lenin") and [Joseph Stalin](/wiki/Joseph_Stalin "Joseph Stalin") voiced similar ideas, but did not invoke the saying:[[5]](#cite_note-:Shevchenko-5)

* Lenin: "Put no faith in words; subject everything to the closest scrutiny—such is the motto of the Marxist workers"[[22]](#cite_note-22)
* Stalin said in an interview with [Bela Kun](/wiki/B%C3%A9la_Kun "Béla Kun"): "Healthy distrust makes a good basis for cooperation" .[[23]](#cite_note-dslov-23)

The sequel of the film *[A Great Life](/wiki/A_Great_Life "A Great Life")*, *[A Great Life, 2](/w/index.php?title=A_Great_Life,_2&action=edit&redlink=1 "A Great Life, 2 (page does not exist)") [[ru](https://ru.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D0%91%D0%BE%D0%BB%D1%8C%D1%88%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D0%B6%D0%B8%D0%B7%D0%BD%D1%8C._%D0%92%D1%82%D0%BE%D1%80%D0%B0%D1%8F_%D1%81%D0%B5%D1%80%D0%B8%D1%8F "ru:Большая жизнь. Вторая серия")]* (shot in 1946 but shelved until 1958) uses the saying as it is.[[23]](#cite_note-dslov-23)

* MongoDB

Management interfaces:

* telnet cli
* HTTPS interface

Monitoring:

TURN authentication mechanisms:

* 'classic' long-term credentials mechanism;
* TURN REST API (a modification of the long-term mechanism, for time-limited secret-based authentication, for WebRTC applications: <http://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-uberti-behave-turn-rest-00>);
* experimental third-party oAuth-based client authorization option;

Performance and Load Balancing:

When used as a part of an ICE solution, for VoIP connectivity, this TURN server can handle thousands simultaneous calls per CPU (when TURN protocol is used) or tens of thousands calls when only STUN protocol is used. For virtually unlimited scalability a load balancing scheme can be used. The load balancing can be implemented with the following tools (either one or a combination of them):

* DNS SRV based load balancing;
* built-in 300 ALTERNATE-SERVER mechanism (requires 300 response support by the TURN client);
* network load-balancer server.

Traffic bandwidth limitation and congestion avoidance algorithms implemented.

Target platforms:

* Linux (Debian, Ubuntu, Mint, CentOS, Fedora, Redhat, Amazon Linux, Arch Linux, OpenSUSE)
* BSD (FreeBSD, NetBSD, OpenBSD, DragonFlyBSD)
* Solaris 11
* Mac OS X
* Cygwin (for non-production R&D purposes)
* Windows (native with, e.g., MSVC toolchain)

This project can be successfully used on other `*NIX` platforms, too, but that is not officially supported.

The implementation is supposed to be simple, easy to install and configure. The project focuses on performance, scalability and simplicity. The aim is to provide an enterprise-grade TURN solution.

To achieve high performance and scalability, the TURN server is implemented with the following features:

* High-performance industrial-strength Network IO engine libevent2 is used
* Configurable multi-threading model implemented to allow full usage of available CPU resources (if OS allows multi-threading)
* Multiple listening and relay addresses can be configured
* Efficient memory model used
* The TURN project code can be used in a custom proprietary networking environment. In the TURN server code, an abstract networking API is used. Only couple files in the project have to be re-written to plug-in the TURN server into a proprietary environment. With this project, only implementation for standard UNIX Networking/IO API is provided, but the user can implement any other environment. The TURN server code was originally developed for a high-performance proprietary corporate environment, then adopted for UNIX Networking API
* The TURN server works as a user space process, without imposing any special requirements on the system

Edit: Just re-read the article, this part stood out: > the attacker(s) had access to privileged credentials that were previously stored in the LastPass account of a Ubiquiti IT employee, and gained root administrator access to all Ubiquiti AWS accounts, including all S3 data buckets, all application logs, all databases, all user database credentials, and secrets required to forge single sign-on (SSO) cookies. > Adam says Ubiquiti’s security team picked up signals in late December 2020 that someone with administrative access had set up several Linux virtual machines that weren’t accounted for. If this is true, and whoever breached them had full access to their AWS account, can we really trust them to clean up all their tokens and fully eradicate all forms of persistence the hackers may have gotten? | | --- | --- | --- | | | --- | --- | --- | --- | | |  |  | [IgorPartola](user?id=IgorPartola) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26638730)   | [parent](#26638541) | [next](#26639726) [–]  Was shopping for alternatives to my Ubiquiti last night. Seems like there is nothing good out there. Engenius has shit hardware and a cloud controller. Aruba has a cloud controller AND you have to pay for a license. Cisco makes you pay for a license. TP-Link is cloud-based. WTF. Does anyone have a decent WAP where I can use PoE, deploy like 5 of them and have them support roaming between APs, all managed locally? Is that too much to ask? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [azernik](user?id=azernik) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26640907)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26638730) | [next](#26639061) [–]  Disclaimer: worked for Meraki (now Cisco Meraki) for several years. Generally, halfway decent wireless APs are all targeted at the enterprise market. Consumer hardware is a brutal race to the bottom, as lay consumers aren't qualified to compare options based on anything but price and UI. Ubiquiti was an outlier in trying to bring enterprise features to the consumer market The problem for enthusiasts and small business/home office setups like yours are that both the enterprise market (e.g. Meraki) and the premium consumer market (e.g. Google WiFi) focus heavily on ease of management - cloud controllers are table stakes these days, not a controversial feature. Part of that premium that Meraki, Aruba, and that class of enterprise supplier charge is about having a trustworthy and secured backend. Note, however, that roaming between APs is a feature of the 802.11 standard; you just need to have all your APs on the same layer 2 (802.x) network, and using the same SSID and credentials. No fancy hardware required, and you can even mix and match vendors. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [SV\_BubbleTime](user?id=SV_BubbleTime) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26641141)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26640907) | [next](#26642341) [–]  My personal experience with Meraki has been the very definition of vendor lock-in. The security appliance was relatively cheap, then we saw the fine print that the total bandwidth was artificially limited and increased only adaquetly two product levels up. Sorry Mr BubbleTime, you need to buy a new applicance and a new license. Your old one is worth nothing and non-transferable, watch it rot. The switches seem absurdly expensive when you consider the 5-7 year licensing costs. And the quality is poor at best considering Meraki went and pushed a firmware update that bricked every fan in every 48 port switch we had. But you have the security appliance so it “only makes sense” to pay for these switches. We had an IPSEC incompatibility between a vendor with an ASA and our Meraki gear. The solution was to buy a Cisco device just for that one connection. All in all, it’s passable, but because of the lock-in it’s not like I have a cost effective choice to get away from it. I wouldn’t chose it again. That said, it does offer a mediocre IT tech a single pane of glass they have to try to mess up. Of all the Meraki factors I’ve learned and considered, that it is cloud-based is the least important towards my recommendation or lack of. There are lots of people that would be happy to explain all the ways my experience is wrong, but whatever. Short version, I wouldn’t do it again. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jlawer](user?id=jlawer) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26641222)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26641141) | [next](#26641433) [–]  Completely agree with the lock-in, and they aren't the best / featureful device out there. It seems the sweet spot for them is places with LARGE distributed footprints (such as retailers), where you can have very simple networking (some back to HQ, the rest to internet). It fits well with being able to rapidly bring bodies into a project and implement change X across hundreds of stores, while having a standing IT team of 5. If you have onsite (fulltime) IT, its likely not the best option. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [foobiekr](user?id=foobiekr) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26641433)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26641141) | [prev](#26641222) | [next](#26641752) [–]  Is there a community for this kind of discussion at this point? When I was an admin, and then later working in networking in the 2000s, there were tons of very active mailing lists, not just for hardcore networking but for IT-oriented stuff, mostly all faded to a shadow of their former selves.

That was my original point: "Generally, halfway decent wireless APs are all targeted at the enterprise market. Consumer hardware is a brutal race to the bottom, as lay consumers aren't qualified to compare options based on anything but price and UI. Ubiquiti was an outlier in trying to bring enterprise features to the consumer market" I don't know what your standard for a 10-to-50-employee small business is, but "point your browser at this IP address" is usually beyond their in-house technical skills [1]. Small businesses whose core competence is software/networking, or who by coincidence have that expertise in-house, are a tiny niche market. No one [2] cares. [1] See for example the rise of the Managed Service Provider, which was a large and growing subsegment for Meraki back in 2015 or so.

It's hard to imagine why these devices need a UI at all, when the engineer who installs the equipment could just set it up once and then you're done. *In practice, customers are okay with these being unavailable during internet outages as long as both the management platform and the ISP are on a pretty strict SLA.* John: Bob, the Internet is out again. Who do I call at the ISP? Bob: We don't have a dedicated contact, it's just the business support number on their website. John: I'm in the queue, at number 17. What's our maximum time for someone from the ISP to contact us about an outage? That might be faster. Bob: No-one will call, but if it's not back by next business day we do get £50 off next month's bill. (This is roughly how that conversation probably goes when you're a 20-person organisation with two floor of an office building on a business park outside a small town.) *(Compare, for example, the usual downtime from your 1-4-person IT team not having someone with the right skills on call.)* What's an IT team? *Who has the cash for that?* What cash? When we have a new starter, John or Bob sets up the WiFi on their laptop and company phone and adds those MAC addresses to the whitelist for the network. Normally John works in development and Bob works in sales, but they do know a bit about networks so this is fine. Well, as long as they can get to the GUI, anyway. *Small businesses whose core competence is software/networking, or who by coincidence have that expertise in-house, are a tiny niche market. No one [2] cares.* And yet as someone who has worked for software development businesses for an entire career and whose customers/clients have mostly been other relatively small organisations of one type or another, I have never met one that didn't. Of course that could be because I've tended to work with other technically-inclined businesses, but the same is true even for schools or my own business's accountants. I'm not claiming this is some sort of universal truth, but I don't think the market is nearly as tiny as you're suggesting, at least not in this part of the world (the UK). Remember, we're probably not talking about setting up encrypted WAN tunnels across continents and multiple layers of switches in a data centre here. We're more likely to be talking about getting an Internet connection with suitable firewall set up, connecting a handful of switches and APs and making sure everyone knows the WiFi password, and installing everyday software on the staff PCs and mobile devices with maybe some basic configuration and enabling updates. *[1] See for example the rise of the Managed Service Provider, which was a large and growing subsegment for Meraki back in 2015 or so. Showing up, installing the hardware, setting up the wireless, and then managing it from your office a few miles away is a big business opportunity, and is a much more efficient use of limited skilled IT labor.* They're not unheard-of here, but again, in my experience such arrangements are far less common in smaller organisations than just having a couple of people on the staff who also "set up the IT" and know enough for the kinds of everyday admin tasks you're talking about. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [azernik](user?id=azernik) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26643690)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26643443) | [next](#26642662) [–]  > What cash?

Having looked at sales numbers and market research for a company that sold internationally and cross-industry: yes, your experience is very unrepresentative. > even for schools... Tangent: schools are honestly pretty technically sophisticated! We sold to some of them at Meraki, but they were drawn to us more for labor savings than to compensate for limited expertise. Education customers typically had very few (especially in perpetually-underfunded US primary and secondary schools), but very competent, IT people. They were feature-hungry power users. In part that's because, even with low employee headcount, they have to provide a surprising level of IT services per student as well. A school with 80 employees and 1000 students probably has the IT workload of a white-collar employer with 500+ headcount. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Silhouette](user?id=Silhouette) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26644017)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26643690) | [next](#26642662) [–]  *You have that expertise in house.

Use low-cost consumer hardware with zero centralized management, and set it up with the same expertise and judgment as your typical residential deployment. 2. Have one admin person with the wherewithal work with web UIs, and wants a simple setup-and-forget system. UI not much more complicated than a single-AP residential deployment, user management workflow no more complicated than adding a G-Suite user. If they can use the default password for the admin system, they will (which e.g. Meraki and Aruba don't have in any meaningful sense). | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [Silhouette](user?id=Silhouette) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26645187)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26644481) | [next](#26642662) [–]  OK, so let's look at the second of those, since the first is consumer level and not really our target market for professional grade networking equipment. Your original contention was that it's hard to implement a single pane UI without putting a bunch of logic in the cloud. If our hypothetical one admin person with some idea of what they're doing, together with any automatic assistance the relevant devices provide, can set up enough local networking that all of those devices can reliably access the Internet and support cloud-based configuration, then a similar process can set up those devices to support single pane configuration using the LAN only. At that point, looking back to the four "hard problems" you enumerated a few comments ago, I still don't see a strong argument for needing the cloud dependency. The risks around network setup and reliability don't seem any worse for LAN-based configuration than cloud-based. In fact, LAN-based clearly has an advantage by not relying on any external infrastructure. It also has the advantage that if you want to get more serious for a larger deployment, you can run independent cabling and create a dedicated management network for control signalling, while most places aren't going to have an independent second Internet connection for management traffic if you accidentally break your configuration so your main data network loses Internet access. Managing multiple sites is probably a non-issue at this level of the market. Remote access for IT/support people is easily provided if necessary by having safe and easy VPN setup as part of your user-friendly interface. This has the added advantage that your tech people can also reach any other parts of the network they need, and so you might have required this functionality anyway. And if it's locally configured, you can always quickly shut that VPN access off again in case of any security worries, without needing anyone else's remote systems to be working properly before you can secure your own in an emergency. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [kortilla](user?id=kortilla) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26642662)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26642137) | [prev](#26642463) | [next](#26641642) [–]  > 4.

It's *so nearly* there. The power management stuff means that even with single a physical radio one can associate with multiple BSS's on different frequencies by telling one BSS to hold packets for you while tuning in to the other frequency. All that's needed to make it reality is a way to tell a BSS "If I fail to ACK a link layer packet, please forward it via the wired network to this other BSS to send to me instead". Then a client could be connected to multiple BSS's, send packets via either, receive packets via whichever one it is currently tuned into, and not lose any packets while switching. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jhugo](user?id=jhugo) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26642489)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26642341) | [prev](#26643001) | [next](#26645085) [–]  You can fix this on the AP side with minimum RSSI or data rate control.

I don't think openwrt had data rate config in webui, but it does support the setting in the config files (that I normally scp onto a device).

No fancy hardware required, and you can even mix and match vendors. Not exactly. There are extensions to pre-authenticate with an AP (802.11r) for truly seamless roaming without packet drop or delay and for AP controlled roaming (802.11k) where the current AP tells you your options to roam to. This last one is important because the AP has generally better information about the network than the client and because the clients are not that great at managing this. I am sure there are other extensions too, but afaik cheap APs don't implement these. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [azernik](user?id=azernik) [on April 1, 2021](item?id=26656128)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26646152) | [next](#26641371) [–]  Depends on your definition of "seamless". The base standard's behavior requires a reassociation to the new cell (i.e. AP i.e. BSSID). This introduces a gap in coverage, but for simple setups like the 5-AP one IgorPortola is talking - I assumed that this was using shared-password auth - the gap's length is functionally 0. 802.11r gets rid of that gap, which is important when using heavier-weight authentication protocols like 802.1x.

It can run on a raspberry pi, or an x86 container / vm. If I wanted to run it all the time, I’d try putting it in a docker container on my synology. Instead, I have an sd card for my raspberry pi that has nothing but the controller installed. The main downsides to this are that it is easy to lose the sd card, and that the controller gathers bandwidth/usage/wifi connection reliability stats, but only when it is running. I don’t get those unless I boot up the RPi to diagnose some network issue (this has never been an issue in practice). One advantage of the RPi setup over a synology container is that it has both a ethernet jack and a wifi adaptor. This is surprisingly helpful when bootstrapping complicated mesh topologies. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [MobileVet](user?id=MobileVet) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26642910)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26642367) | [prev](#26642837) | [next](#26643134) [–]  Yep, I put it in a Docker container on the Synology.

For open networks or simple auth schemes like WPA2 single-password, this isn't very noticeable; however, for heavier-weight auth schemes like 802.1x this pause is substantial and is especially noticeable on voice/video calls. 802.11r is a scheme for caching the authentication info, letting you avoid the 802.1x round-trip to a central auth server.

For example with pfSense going closed source we’d be willing to pay around $100 total lifetime cost to put it on PCEngines hardware. We can build that in to the upfront cost of the device. I wouldn’t be shocked if they try for $50-$100 / year which won’t be economically viable for our market, so instead of getting $100 / device and never interacting with us, we’ll end up moving to a different product.

I moved the config I mentioned above (the three APs) to my parents' house and they haven't had any problems. Throughput in their case is a little limited but that's expected with the installation (no ethernet and a lotta walls). Hasn't needed a reboot or anything. I just started using an EAP660 HD[1] at home a week ago, so far so good. Haven't topped out the speeds yet because nothing in my house can take advantage, but I have some AX200 cards coming. I understand there's a throughput bug at the moment that's going to be solved in a future firmware fix[0], but my clients don't go fast enough to hit that yet. TP-Link seems to very actively update their firmware for the pieces I've been using, FWIW. So I've been pretty happy with it so far. Roaming has been fine, though in one case I think I had non-optimally located a couple of APs because my Linux laptop kept rapid-fire flapping between two of them. I believe that's a client-side problem, though. I did try a Cisco 240AC and its wifi performance was rock solid. The management interface is non-cloud, and I believe covers the whole network, but it lives inside the AP itself, which I don't love. The management UI is buggy and they seem slow to push bugfixes, and when I added a 142ACM to extend my network it started going flaky -- I had to do a factory reset/reconfigure of the 240AC to resolve it, then it happened again a few weeks later -- so I'm gonna flip my Cisco stuff on eBay. :-( [0] [https://hwp.media/articles/review\_and\_test\_of\_the\_tp\_link\_ea...](https://hwp.media/articles/review_and_test_of_the_tp_link_eap_660hd_wi_fi_6_access_point/) [1] Tip if you adopt one of these in Omada: You need to give Omada the EAP660's password (default "admin"/"admin") for it to successfully adopt.

No more firmware upgrades for their (then) top "enterprise" access points. Rumour says they weren't happy with the chipset, so decided to abandon them altogether (just this model, cheaper ones were on different chipsets and support was available for longer). Last time I checked there was no OpenWRT support of any kind. They did hang when I had port aggregation enabled and seemed to run rather hot.

For layer2 networking with switches and AP's it's fine. Cost effective, reasonably stable, acceptable performance and features that are regularly used are all there. The layer-3 stuff however is still early days and I can't recommend getting the secure gateway at this time. No IPv6 support. Depends strictly on an internet uplink configuration for default route to which all traffic is then NATted. Can't change that. No real security features, no packet inspection etc. The routing features really feel like an alpha version. They are working on it and have a roadmap to a more workable layer-3 solution. So maybe in the future the will be as nice as the Ubiquity solution. Cloud is not needed but possible. You can get an OC-200 controller for not much money that fills the role of single pane configuration webinterface. The software for that controller can also be downloaded for Linux on PC or ARM if you want to use your own hardware.

I've been very happy with roaming/throughput/reliability generally. The EAP-225 is 2x2, which they don't readily announce. Their newer and more expensive units are available as 4x4. That being said they're so cheap, I've been happy just to throw more onto the network. For the software to manage them it uses some kind of multicast identification scheme to find new APs. If you're on a different subnet then it won't be able to automatically see them. They have a tool to connect to the AP and give it the management server IP, but that's Windows only. The other option (that I went for) is just to create a management VLAN (good practice anyway) that the controller and APs live on.

It's a solid piece of kit. The OS, TurrisOS, is based on OpenWRT and for a while they were having trouble keeping up-to-date but that's been sorted in recent releases. There are great features like auto-updates and BTRFS snapshots and the ability to rollback to previous known good if you screw up a config. I also run LXC containers on it for things like PiHole (not on the internal flash but the main board takes an M.2 SSD). The Turris MOX is a modular Turris system that you can assemble from the parts that you need. I have a small Gl.iNet router upstairs flashed with upstream OpenWRT that I use as a WiFi access point and have setup 802.11r for BSSID roaming.

With the CLI you either need to document it yourself, or you need to know to query if there are any port forwards. That can be a problem if there is more than one person responsible for the network, or if someone else needs to inherit your setup. Documentation of configuration sometimes isn’t an issue on your own home system because you generally have a high level memory of what changes you made and their purpose. Conversely I still struggle sometimes with Ubuntu because I customise my configuration using command line tools, and I find keeping track of those changes or the implications of those changes is difficult. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [eecc](user?id=eecc) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26640512)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26639162) | [prev](#26649274) | [next](#26643889) [–]  Yup, very nice router/switch.

Their routers and APs are all based on the same basic RouterBOARD hardware and run the same RouterOS. The specs for each device is pretty well laid out on their site, but you do have to read through a few product pages to find exactly what you're looking for. I would start with a hAP ac², a wireless router that is approximately the equivalent of their hEX Ethernet router plus a dual-band AP (cAP/wAP ac). It's a great standalone device and less than $70, or you could get the individual devices for a bit more flexibility. Avoid the models labeled "lite", those are low-cost versions with lower routing speeds and 2.4GHz WLAN only. For management you can obviously configure each device separately, or you can use CAPsMAN where one device acts as the controller and handles all configuration. It's not as slick as Ubiquiti, but it works. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [stock\_toaster](user?id=stock_toaster) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26639375)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26638895) | [prev](#26640169) | [next](#26638862) [–]  I use the edgerouter line for firewalls, and unifi (running on a local "cloud key", with cloud login turned off) for only access-points and some switches.

So, while this whitepaper is news to me, how is this an "NSA backdoor". Reading up on this, it sounds like \* it was required, much as with phone tapping, by the US gov \* ergo, ISPs needed it, were mandated to have it \* therefore, CISCO implemented it \* this protocol was for lawful intercept. Police, FBI, everyone. While beyond annoying, this is not a back door for the NSA. Nor is it even secret. Before you get all pissy, you should at least state fact as fact. Not exaggerate. Not make it about a specific actor, when it isn't. And not during a whataboutism.

That’s your assumption not supported by evidence. So let’s run through it. Cisco writes white paper supporting LE back door access. LE/IC use hard coded back doors as revealed in the Snowden and Vault7 leaks. You’re saying it never happened, ever. Maybe you’re right (you’re not) but you spoke so firmly! Do you know something I don’t? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [bbarnett](user?id=bbarnett) [on April 1, 2021](item?id=26658217)  [flagged]  | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26653232) | [next](#26639936) [7 more]  Page 4 of the IBM white paper says: *In 2005 the FCC ruled that CALEA applies to broadband Internet providers* So yes, it was mandated. You may disagree with the ruling, but ISPs were required to do something, and Cisco enabled this on products for ISPs. Did they have it beforehand? Yes. However, this product only existed on *certain* products, and other countries required this *before* the 2005 FCC ruling (again, from IBM white paper). But of course, this still isn't "Cisco put in back doors for the NSA". This is "Cisco putting in back doors for law enforcement, including even local police". Further to that, everyone was aware of this. You can't have a 2010 white paper by IBM, before the Snowden leaks even(2013), if it was secret. And realistically, a "back door" isn't quite that, if it is well known. It's just another access point in a product. Secondly the 'Snowden' leaks, which had everyone quite pissed, including Google (whom I hate, but...) starting the big push for SSL everywhere, were not caused by these specific back doors. Heck, this white paper is from *2010*, and this 'law enforcement' "back door" was well known, AND!, not in all Cisco products! How, then, could Google be surprised by this revelation. That this back door existed? How could anyone? It was not a secret. It was not in all products. No, Cisco routers were infiltrated in two ways. Undisclosed vulnerabilities, which the NSA was aware of, and used against *all* router vendors to install NSA malware. And again, by intercepting shipments to end-users, installing NSA backdoors and malware, then resealing and shipping the product onward. This is what the Guardian Snowden leaks talk about! The big differences between China(and your whataboutism), and the US, is that if you don't let the Chinese government into your company, do precisely what it says, and install all the backdoor software it wants? You don't have a company any more, your freedom, and maybe even your life. Meanwhile, the NSA, has been acting illegally, and does NOT have the support of US tech vendors. In fact, US tech vendors are *hostile* to NSA's attempts to subvert their products, including lobbying US politicians to stop this sort of behaviour. There is a vast difference between these two things, and in all of the above, Cisco did not willingly put "back doors" in anything for the NSA. So in reasons to your question? Yes, I know something you don't. History. Factual, actual, history. Not revisionist. I'm happy to re-examine any of this, if you can provide links to data showing Cisco allowing NSA agents into its midst, and installing NSA spyware for its products at the factory. On purpose. Which aren't open, and were hidden from everyone. Or something similar to this. Because otherwise, your statement is absolutely, positively, not factual. How can I say otherwise?

I've been a bit busy with other work since that bombshell dropped, but if I get a moment I'll try to dig up some pricing. The other thing to note is feature discrepancy between Unleashed and standard.

As you may or may not be aware, Ruckus have an "all quoted" policy, there is no price list per-se. At the time I was working on the project (late 2020) Ruckus did have a promotional activity going on where you could buy Unleashed kits at fixed prices without quoting. However due to various technical questions that were coming up (e.g. IPv6 support) we missed the window and it was uncertain if Ruckus were going to extend the promotion. Ruckus did extend the promotion, at least initially (Jan-Feb 21') but then they switched to the "license per AP for Unleashed" and the promotion was killed off. It was at at that point that my friend took the hint and dumped the idea of Ruckus and I went back to my normal work. If I get a chance I'll try to find out what happens about second-hand kit. My guess would be that if you stay on old firmware there's not much they can do about it. Although whether its desirable or advisable to stay on old firmware is another question, obviously. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [traceroute66](user?id=traceroute66) [on April 1, 2021](item?id=26662547)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26651123) | [prev](#26657587) | [next](#26640501) [–]  @c0nsumer Without going into detail because, well, you never know who's reading ....

I bought an R610 AP on eBay a few months back, flashed it with the Ruckus firmware (legally available to all from their site), and it does exactly what you want. On-prem only, no cloud, one of the APs will act as a controller/manager for the others, and they can all communicate via wired or meshing off of each other. One of them can even be a NAT thing if you want. I think I paid around $160 because someone had a bunch of off-lease ones. But if you look up anything that supports the Unleashed firmware you'll be good. 802.1ax is the hotness right now, so the slightly older (but still work great) ones are a LOT cheaper. I replaced a Ubiquiti setup with a Ruckus R610 and small fanless running OPNsense (Protectli) with a basic switch and POE injector and it's excellent. Sure, it's not single pane of glass for it all, but the AP is rock solid and OPNsense is a solid known quantity. I've got no regrets. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [hyperpl](user?id=hyperpl) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26646876)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26642976) | [next](#26641072) [–]  Same here, I ditched my Ubiquiti and went with Ruckus and I could not be happier.

In this space, you'll find cloud based options, controller based options, and standalone. If you are willing to go this price range, I think FortiAPs feeding back to a Fortigate FW is rock solid solution. But a FortiAP-431F is $616. And a base FG60F as controller is $535 + service if you need it. And although you probably won't need repair options, support/maintenance is a yearly fee ontop of that.

I've been trying for the last few days and it's so difficult that I can understand things like this. I don't think it's acceptable, but I can see how it happens. I think the expectation for AWS, Azure, GCP, etc. needs to change. Accounts should allow nothing by default and part of the tutorial / learning process should be understanding the permissions needed for each service and how to limit access to those services. As a bonus, they should show you how to configure Budget Actions to catch anomalies and runaway services. For example, I'm trying to set up my account so SMTP access to SES gets revoked for SMTP users if the message count exceeds a certain threshold.

While your concerns are 100% valid, we need to remember too that setting up access in restricted ways and inviting users to understand the protection and remove the correct barriers, or implement the concerns necessary to interact with those for themselves, always runs the risk that some users will find your protections cumbersome and instead find a (totally incorrect) way to baffle them, or otherwise even route around them entirely mooting any efforts to secure a platform. And every time I hear this played out in conversation, the answer is "that's on them!" But it's clearly a balancing act, it's a trade off; tautologically, when you make the service less accessible then... it is, well, ... made less accessible. Besides facilitation of the secure access also sales conversion ratios will depend on that accessibility. The crux of your argument stands, the defaults are too open, and we need to do more to ensure that naive users aren't handed a loaded gun to aim at their own feet. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jval43](user?id=jval43) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26645006)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26640031) | [next](#26640631) [–]  A classic one is chmod 777 for "fixing" Linux issues.

The biggest mistake I made was creating an admin user, but giving it too many permissions and using it like a normal user. After learning more I use the root account to make an admin account, but I think the admin account should only use IAM to create other fine grained users.

Someone like Ilja van Sprundel can go in the source code and find a bunch of issues without too much trouble [1]. I don't see any concentrated efforts to improve the status quo (where's formal methods, where's automated fuzzing, where are initiatives to employ more safe programming languages, static analysis, etc.). And while OpenBSD pride themselves on their mitigations, they aren't exactly state of the art and some of the more recent stuff (like trying to eliminate ROP gadgets) seems just futile. The biggest thing OpenBSD did with mitigations was enabling them by default for the base system and ports. What does anyone remember OpenBSD for in 2010-2020? Pledge, probably. That's a nice thing but more for containing the damage than actually making stuff secure in the first place.

Until then, these issues sit quietly waiting for a malicious party to discover them. There's quite some fanfare for OpenBSD, but how many of you are actively auditing the code? I'm subscribed to cvs@ and tech@ and I read them daily and I just don't see much contribution at all from outsiders. And when I do see it, it's mostly stuff like fixing typos or amending man pages. All the commits that change code with security implications tend to come from the core developers, and are reviewed by a handful of people at best.

This seems like a structural advantage to less popular software. If your software is less common, attackers will have put less time into exploiting it, and therefore you will be more secure. My impression is that MacOS and Linux both benefited from this relative to Windows for a long time. In general this should be true if usage grows faster than security resources for popular system. It might be still be true even with significant, commensurate investments in security while you grow, because if a small percentage of users mis-configure the software and create vulnerabilities, that population will hit a critical mass with growth regardless of your security efforts. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [dathinab](user?id=dathinab) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26638799)   | [parent](#26638541) | [prev](#26639842) | [next](#26639819) [–]  Man I really wonder why the lack of proper 2FA is so wide spread?

Joseph Heller predicted 2FA in Catch 22 when he wrote: "*Almost overnight the Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade was in full flower, and Captain Black was enraptured to discover himself spearheading it. He had really hit on something. All the enlisted men and officers on combat duty had to sign a loyalty oath to get their map cases from the intelligence tent, a second loyalty oath to receive their flak suits and parachutes from the parachute tent, a third loyalty oath for Lieutenant Balkington, the motor vehicle officer, to be allowed to ride from the squadron to the airfield in one of the trucks.* *Every time they turned around there was another loyalty oath to be signed. They signed a loyalty oath to get their pay from the finance officer, to obtain their PX supplies, to have their hair cut by the Italian barbers. To Captain Black, every officer who supported his Glorious Loyalty Oath Crusade was a competitor, and he planned and plotted twentyfour hours a day to keep one step ahead. He would stand second to none in his devotion to country. When other officers had followed his urging and introduced loyalty oaths of their own, he went them one better by making every son of a bitch who came to his intelligence tent sign two loyalty oaths, then three, then four;*" Notice how 2FA turns into MFA? Keep adding FA until you're as secure as the security theater demands. "*To anyone who questioned the effectiveness of the loyalty oaths, he replied that people who really did owe allegiance to their country would be proud to pledge it as often as he forced them to. The more 2factor logins a person went through in a working day, the more secure he was; to Captain Black it was as simple as that*" "*Captain Piltchard and Captain Wren were both too timid to raise any outcry against Captain Black, who scrupulously enforced each day the doctrine of 'Continual Reaffirmation' that he had originated, a doctrine designed to trap all those men who had become insecure since the last time they passed a 2factor authentication prompt a few minutes earlier.*" | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nijave](user?id=nijave) [on April 1, 2021](item?id=26655848)   | [root](#26638541) | [parent](#26643307) | [next](#26644243) [–]  Honestly Windows does this right with AD, Kerberos, Spnego You login to a physical machine with a password (the machine is trusted on the network via AD so physical access is one factor and password is a second) You visit websites and they use SPNEGO to land on Kerberos or NTLM auth which then bootstraps off the fact you're already authenticated to Windows. You never even need to see a login page It's achievable with macOS and Linux but afaik there's some more configuration to be done. The only place I saw with a setup like that was a bank and it was part of a new technology stack that almost nothing used yet With that setup there's almost nothing to phish if you can train people to only enter their password into the OS at login.

Expect people to copy and paste values around, and you’ve already lost. Not to mention legacy code that only knows about access key ID and secret, and doesn’t have a place to even put a token.

All of the bad engineering decisions have been rewarded by increasing stock price and continued sales. Most of the original engineers have quit by now. I lost track of how many UniFi engineering leads joined and then quit after it started falling apart. Before I quit, I heard rumors that the CEO was making two separate teams work on the Dream Machine project separately, competing against each other. That made more people quit.

We have a few publicly traded clients that we've worked with for decades (and by "decades" I mean longer than I've been alive). It's cyclical that they want our engineering to build new products when they're doing bad in the market, and once our work is released and gets them some success they'll design transfer back inhouse as aggressively as possible (their engineers aren't all bad, it's just not an engineering culture there). By the time we're out, they're still riding the upswing. Their management's institutional memory either doesn't see the cycle and/or they don't care beyond the next few quarterly reports.

Businesses put projects out to tender all the time, and other businesses that can provide what is wanted invest sometimes very considerable resources into putting in a bid, knowing that if they don't make the winning bid then those resources will mostly likely be completely wasted. Evidently it is still worth operating a business on that basis because the benefits when you do win outweigh the costs of the failed bids, and those costs might include reducing morale in a team who worked on a failed bid. If that is the case across industries as a whole then economically it *might* make sense for a business to operate on the same basis internally for their Next Big Thing. Run multiple independent teams at the start, give them all the same brief, then see which team comes up with the most promising starting point. I don't see much of an argument for continuing the internal competition beyond the concept to prototype stage, though, unless perhaps it turned out that more than one team could produce a product that was viable in its own right without competing for the same market. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [fletchowns](user?id=fletchowns) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26640984)   | [root](#26638985) | [parent](#26640121) | [prev](#26640383) | [next](#26640108) [–]  Isn't Oracle notorious for doing this? | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [ihsw](user?id=ihsw) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26640108)   | [root](#26638985) | [parent](#26639745) | [prev](#26640121) | [next](#26641193) [–]  What do you suggest for someone leaning on an EdgeRouter Lite (with EdgeOS v1.10.11, staying far away from v2.x) and a Unifi UAP-AC-PRO access point?

Any ex-Unifi folks or other pros are welcome to correct me: - The Edgerouter absolutely does not talk to ui.com (except check-for-updates). There's no remote control ability etc etc. - The Unifi range can be controlled from the cloud, but via your Unifi Cloud Key. You can run this software yourself, without buying extra hardware.

We looked into this when fitting out a new office with the networking essentials a couple of years ago, and Ubiquiti wasn't particularly attractive on headline prices compared to the other typical brands that get mentioned in that space (MikroTik, DrayTek, etc.). However, the ability for non-networking experts to set something up quickly that does the job and doesn't have glaring security problems is definitely a competitive advantage in that prosumer to small business market. None of those other brands has a great UI that I've seen and they all tend to assume that anyone who wants to set up a couple of extra APs for a small office WiFi and a standard firewall for the Internet connection will be a pro-level network expert. I think it would help a lot of people if better products/companies started to compete seriously on that front, and I have to think that with the SME market to fight for there is room to compete with the established names.

You're talking about brands aimed at enterprise customers. I have no idea how much penetration Ubiquiti has managed to make into that market, but certainly around these parts its products are better known in the tier below that. The kind of organisation that is considering Ubiquiti IME probably wants significantly more functionality and scalability than home or entry-level small office gear but isn't working at enterprise scale and doesn't want to pay for it either.

They actively avoid tracking or learning about discussion of their products on social media. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [anchpop](user?id=anchpop) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26643226)   | [root](#26638593) | [parent](#26640838) | [next](#26643737) [–]  Sounds like a case of poor incentives. It's easy to wag our fingers and say "well they shouldn't be doing that" but difficult to come up with a system of incentives that makes everyone want to do what's socially beneficial. In this case, it seems like there should be a separate organization in charge of looking for adverse events that is rewarded for finding events (instead of punished).

Choose advanced 4. Disable Remote Access 5. Confirm that "Transfer owner" won't be available if you disable remote access. The issue in general is that the UniFi stuff can be crappy and buggy, but it SUCKS LESS then any other complete solution for a home / small enterprise there at the price point.

You have local and SSO account. You disable remote access in your local cloud key. You open the local IP for the CK and are able to sign in using the SSO account is what you are saying, so auth token is coming from remote. Question if I got this correct, can you go to the ui.com portal, the UI cloud based one in a web browser do you see the controller still? Can you login and still manage it through the remote web portal? This is what turning off remote access does. You should not be able to manage the system remotely. Disabling remote access is for the remote web base ui site portal and that should not work after you disable remote access (my understanding). It is possible that you can connect to the local controller and use SSO to authorize vs web and be passed a valid token to login however that would be local only and not remote. Ie the hacker would have to have your SSO AND be on your local network. Have you tired / are you able to delete the SSO account in the local CK? I have not tried but will later.

My approach has been an isolated (read basically no internet) LAN, bridged by a small PC running hardened and locked down Linux. There's no egress from the LAN. VPN access to this LAN goes via the PC under my control, which itself has access to the wider internet via its second interface. This approach is nice as I don't have to trust any router vendor or proprietary software vendor to be competent, by relying on their equipment to control internet access for devices. Although I recognise this is probably inconvenient for users, none of this is really too impractical - a bit of adverse publicity for cloud and "internet connected", and I could see properly firewalled, egress blocked networks taking off... (I am more concerned about egress than ingress, because it's the biggest gap most people forget about, and most people just rely on NAT to stop ingress, forgetting any device can phone home anywhere, and they're not monitoring... I don't even allow DNS on that network.

Ubiquiti makes essentially little (weaker) Raspberry Pi devices with PoE that are dedicated to just the controller, and a few years back they also forced their (garbage) "Protect" onto their hardware only. They (confusingly) call these "Cloud Keys", though they have nothing to do with the cloud. However, you can also get 100% standalone versions of the Controller that will run on any server or VM you've got, Linux, Windows, or Mac. This is just the Java 8-based controller software and that's it, and you can lock those down arbitrarily hard for any WAN access same as any other LAN network software, no general internet access is needed at all and no firmware is involved. A lot of people quite reasonably got CKs seeing them as very easy ways to have a low power always on local controller since they didn't have some other server running 24/7 already. If the firmware on those was updated to require tie-in to Ubiquiti's SSO that's a horrible betrayal. But I'm confident in saying the full standalone Controller doesn't since I have mine locked down from any general net access, remote L3 management was done to IP only at the firewall and I've been switching to just putting it all through WireGuard. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pseudalopex](user?id=pseudalopex) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26638671)   | [root](#26638562) | [parent](#26638618) | [prev](#26639171) | [next](#26638664) [–]  They forced cloud authentication on self hosted software too.[1] [1] [https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/kslyh9/cloud\_key\_...](https://www.reddit.com/r/Ubiquiti/comments/kslyh9/cloud_key_local_account/) | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [imiric](user?id=imiric) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26638848)   | [root](#26638562) | [parent](#26638671) | [next](#26638664) [–]  Wow, that's awful.

If you assume the password manager is secure (which something clearly wasn't in this case, but that seems like an outlier), TOTP secret in the password manager still secures the account. Is such a setup as protective as a separate storage method? No, but it's leagues more convenient. A cloud-based PW manager also solves the problem of a lost/broken/new phone causing you to lose all of your 2FA setups. Some 2FA apps do as well (Authy, iirc), but trust me when I say people lose 2FA codes \_all the time\_. And then 2FA needs to be disabled by support, which is its own can of worms. The best security measures are the ones people actually use. If not having to use a separate app is the convenience people need, then I think it's totally worth it. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [jpalawaga](user?id=jpalawaga) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26644040)   | [root](#26638602) | [parent](#26639101) | [next](#26639343) [–]  You know what's also convenient? 1FA.

The F in 2FA is factor. Satisfying one login request from one factor (password vault) is 1FA. This is why the second factor is normally something that isn't your password vault (historically your head, now a piece of software): a hardware key, a recovery code, etc. A slightly more generous interpretation is 1.49A (rounds down), because someone with a reused username/password combination. But if you're using a vault with a sophisticated factor, the venn diagram of "people who have your password," and "people who also have your master password," are pretty tight, except for cases where the provide has been breached (all bets are off). Don't dispose of the second factor for convenience. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [amarshall](user?id=amarshall) [on April 1, 2021](item?id=26660915)   | [root](#26638602) | [parent](#26653853) | [next](#26639343) [–]  And the A in 2FA is authentication, not storage. The password vault is not a factor because it is not what is provided for authentication, the individual password is the factor. The fact that the vault being compromised reveals both factors does not make it no longer 2FA. Colocating the storage factors definitely makes certain attack vectors possible that aren’t otherwise possible, but it’s still 2FA. Are hardware keys best? Likely, but still many probably have their password vault and TOTP application and storage on the same device (e.g. both Bitwarden and Authy on their mobile device) which is a middle-ground convenience vs. security between TOTP in the password vault and hardware keys—but I doubt many would say that it’s not 2FA. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [artful-hacker](user?id=artful-hacker) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26639343)   | [root](#26638602) | [parent](#26638919) | [prev](#26639101) | [next](#26641474) [–]  Because I already use MFA to access my password manager in the first place, and don't want to deal with managing backups for each flavor of MFA app that is pushed on me. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [nightpool](user?id=nightpool) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26640232)   | [root](#26638602) | [parent](#26639343) | [next](#26641474) [–]  How do you manage MFA for encryption-at-rest?

What you typically do is MFA (bare minimum) + sharded secrets. This means you need multiple people to use the root user account. You can also hook in additional audit controls eg by automating cloud watch and sending notifications about any root user login. Alternative is that you throw away the password and vow to never use it, or set up an account recovery process (all of this may not be a great idea as it can fail when you need it most). The situation is somewhat more relaxed with GCP Billing Accounts and Azure EA Accounts, though they have better separation of concerns than AWS (billing vs. workload access). Nonetheless, never give these passwords to finance department lest they store it in an excel sheet on a SharePoint. Access to these credentials allows anyone to suspend billing for an entire enterprise... not sure what controls the providers have in place to verify any of this before initiating automated shutdown of all workloads. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [meepmorp](user?id=meepmorp) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26638802)   | [root](#26638602) | [parent](#26638734) | [prev](#26638959) | [next](#26639042) [–]  I use a Yubikey, personally. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [aaomidi](user?id=aaomidi) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26639042)   | [root](#26638602) | [parent](#26638734) | [prev](#26638802) | [next](#26641456) [–]  Hardware keys should be used to store stuff like: - private keys for ssh, gpg, vpn auth - 2fa for sudo access, password manager access, etc | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [H8crilA](user?id=H8crilA) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26641456)   | [prev](#26638602) | [next](#26643227) [–]  By the way, reporting to krebsonsecurity is a giant waste of potential income.

Whenever the topic of routers came up, many comments followed that recommended them above any alternatives. Commenters seemed proud to tell the world they were using Ubiquiti, as if the "HN concensus" for home routers was to choose Ubiquiti. It seemed to me Ubiquiti would never allow customers the option to install their own OS (e.g., BSD) or boot from external media containing a non-Ubiquiti OS, without sacrificing the benefits of hardware specs that were likely deciding factors in selecting the Ubiquiti hardware above existing alternatives. The intent was clearly to have Ubiquiti retain control over the hardware after purchase. The customer effectively remained tied to Ubiquiti forever, so if the company started serving ads, using AWS unnecessarily, etc., there's no way to opt out. Customer is compelled to accept all updates. Specs are important, but maybe not as important as control. Reliance on third parties necessarily increases potential risk. Unnecessary use of third parties is, IMO, poor decision-making. This is of course rampant in "tech" and, IMO, marks a triumph of the salesforce for those third parties over common sense, possibly assisted by network effects. Further, I dislike products where there is a heavy focus on opaque "updates". Again, many customers have been trained to believe that not updating is always the wrong decision. (Meanwhile they have no idea what is in each update.) As stated in one of the blog post comments: "It is even worse: Ubiquiti forced all users to use cloud-based authentification even for accessing your controller software on a local network with a local client. This was not even properly communicated but deployed by one of the regular maintenance updates." | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [myrandomcomment](user?id=myrandomcomment) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26639893)   | [parent](#26639201) | [next](#26645062) [–]  I do not understand this comment. Ubiquiti sells turn key HW and there never was any hint that this was HW you could roll you own on. I could buy APs that I could install OpenWRT. I could setup an OpenBSD firewall. I could run my own DNS. I have done all this in the past. The point is I do not want to anymore. I have better things to do with my time. So as a turn key solution that is "prosumer" their kit works and I think you will find that is why most people here have recommend it. You can disable the Cloud connection and I posted how in this thread. People on HN are tech savvy enough I sort that part. The fact of the matter is they had a bad security breach and they have a cloud connected platform. Ops. That sucks. But the reality is that market forces have pretty much tied evaluations to cloud connections and telemetry gathered from it. That is the part that REALLY sucks. I do not blame them for trying to make money. I am angry if they were less then truthful in the details of the breach and I am sure both the SEC and the court of public option with punish them. For my part, I have no plans to replace the 4 switches in my house with boxes running SONiC nor the 4 APs with OpenWRT or my firewall with OpenBSD because I just really do not care to have to maintain it, and if I drop dead tomorrow my wife can likely sort the UniFi stuff (as I have documentation on the setup) but there is no way could she sort the roll you own. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [KirillPanov](user?id=KirillPanov) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26645062)   | [parent](#26639201) | [prev](#26639893) | [next](#26639905) [–]  > It seemed to me Ubiquiti would never allow customers the option to install their own OS I run plain-vanilla Debian on all my Ubiquiti boxes, six or seven of them at this point. ```     debootstrap --arch=mips  ``` Octeons are awesome.

See ```    man debootstrap  ``` for details. Debootstrap is the tool that generates a "minimum bootable rootfs". You can use any existing debian install (even a non-mips architecture) to do the debootstrap. You will need to build your own kernel. Check the OpenWRT project for patches, although only a very very few Ubiquiti devices (USG-3 for example) *need* kernel patches. For other devices (EdgeRouter-4) the OpenWRT packages make things nicer, like getting the network device names to match what's printed on the front of the case. Put the kernel and rootfs on a USB stick, plug it into the router, attach the serial console (nice easy RJ45 jack on the front!) and boot. Once it's up you can migrate stuff to the internal soldered-down emmc.

Only the largest organizations have the capability to operate deep defenses against these threats whether it's the cloud, or the on-prem. If you and your team have the skills you can operate fairly effectively on a small scale, but that's a pretty luxurious situation. Most home users can't tell the difference between a router and cable modem hence it's in the interest of cable providers to lower support costs by providing a managed offering. It's terrible from a security perspective, but customers have signed that away. The common theme running through these breaches is that the organization isn't necessarily small, but they aren't Google/Apple/Microsoft-size either. Those companies have multiple layers of expertise and the cash flow to hold up development of anything in order to make sure things are secure. It's hard to wing stuff once the bureaucracy understands security is needed. They even start pushing their product security initiatives outside of product development to mundane departments because they get attacked by very smart actors. You can see from the news it's still far from perfect. Once you get to companies the size of Ubiquiti, you start having challenges with implementing close to the same degree of security because you don't have float in the system to allow for additional costs, delays, etc. on top of the lack of expertise. Apparently Ubiquiti have been hemorrhaging expertise in other areas due to opportunistic cost-cutting, so it isn't a surprise that they suffer and respond in this way given that culture. A bad security decision by one exec in companies of this size can cut across many departments which doesn't happen in the behemoths. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [xoa](user?id=xoa) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26639239)   | [root](#26638683) | [parent](#26639032) | [next](#26639140) [–]  >*The problem is that on-prem isn't much better in many cases. Only the largest organizations have the capability to operate deep defenses against these threats whether it's the cloud, or the on-prem.* One of the truly sad things about all this though is precisely that UniFi made this a lot easier for small orgs and even individuals (and could have gone even farther). Stuff like VLANs and RADIUS became dramatically more accessible "for free", using just what was built-in to a UniFi stack someone might get anyway. Back when they were still more competent Ubiquiti added management VLAN support across the lineup, and the setup is fairly intuitive and then just works. At one point I'd hoped they'd continue in that direction much more. It's not some impossible thing, it mainly just needs better UX putting the pieces together in a graspable way. Graphical VLAN topologies and point-and-click, automating all the certificate authentication/signing stuff, the generation of profiles for onboarding, all the components for this stuff exist right now just not, well, unified. I think a lot of places don't *want to* in fact, because they'd rather push cloud ties since that can yield subscription revenue. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [pseudalopex](user?id=pseudalopex) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26639140)   | [root](#26638683) | [parent](#26639032) | [prev](#26639239) | [next](#26641163) [–]  The problem isn't Ubiquiti using AWS.

If that bug is only accessible from inside of your network to begin with, then that means the attacker would already have to be inside your network. As far as the team having skills, there is not much that ubiquity does that can't be handled on prem, I mean you're already installing physical devices, how much more effort is it to install a controller? Sure, that means you're on the hook for upgrades, but in most cases you're better off not getting them instantly anyway.

An individual vulnerability in a device is an issue but it gets patched. Hopefully it can't be exploited remotely.

Technically EdgeRouter gear is unaffected as it's very cloud-optional, but I can't bring myself to trust any firmware from them at this point.

I think that there are a bunch of issues and one of the biggest ones is that what we say vs what we do are 2 different things. We also have issues where many of the core business practices that are commonly accepted are incompatible with building a secure and resilient infrastructure.

Here or there I've got an SSID w/ a PSK and a hard-set VLAN. Nothing too fancy. Adopting new APs quickly and easily based on a "magic" DNS name, alerting when an AP disappears, and syslog to show association/roaming/disassociation events is about all I want.

How do you manage said AP? The leaked credentials issue here is specifically in SSO Cloud authentication to Controllers, which are used to administer all the actual hardware devices. However, the devices themselves aren't affected. So depending on how, or for that matter if, you manage them you may be unaffected as well which has always been a major touted advantage of UniFi and has indeed proved true right with this very incident. Your post seems to imply you have just that AP and that's it? If you set it up initially (putting the controller on one of your own computers temporarily maybe), and then just left it standalone from there on out you're fine. There is no need to have an active Controller for all the hardware to work as configured, a Controller is just needed to change configuration, collect real time statistics/send notifications, and do necessarily active things like run a guest portal. If you are running a Controller, but you're doing entirely standalone on your own hardware (or your own cloud service for that matter), and haven't enabled Ubiquiti SSO cloud access, you're unaffected. That's how I've always run since I don't trust 3rd party cloud stuff for something like this, ever. It's """only""" an issue for their cloud service, and apparently their "Cloud Keys" and "Dream Machines" as well since they pushed it on people some recent firmware. Which granted covers a lot of surface area, and Ubiquiti has pushed very, very hard (see advertising outrage from just a few days ago).

I have ultimately decided against it. They have lost $1000s of dollars in potential sales (from me anyways). Guess I will just have to go bargain hunting on the used enterprise market, or just ask my BigCorp networking team to see if they sell or give away any of their equipment and try to repair it myself. My only concern would be noise generation and power consumption since they were built for use in data centers. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [buildbot](user?id=buildbot) [on March 31, 2021](item?id=26642409)   | [prev](#26642544) | [next](#26638859) [–]  Wow went from probably not buying their hardware again to immediately needing to remove it in like a single day! | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [xoa](user?id=xoa) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26638859)   | [prev](#26642409) | [next](#26638891) [–]  I wish I could say I was surprised :(. Along with a bunch of other people who've used their products for a decade or more now, I've been watching the ever steepening downward spiral of the company really becoming noticeable over the last 3-4 years. In an academic way, it's actually been kind of fascinating to watch happen in real time over the course of years with fairly front room seats. Seeing the deepening technical debt (lots of *very* old hardware still sold as new with no replacements in sight, inability to migrate their frameworks or keep their sources up to date and more), bikeshedding ramp up and up, the forums start to fall apart, marketing starting to write more and more checks development couldn't keep up with and then that getting brushed under the rug (the SHD and it's dedicated security radio comes to mind), the forums getting nuked entirely in favor of a horrible New Web thing with even worse bug/feature tracking then before and there wasn't any proper one before, ever worsening stability, universally hated UI changes that would just get shoved through anyway, and on and on. It's been everything one reads about, "Ubiquiti's Burning Platform" and all that, and in turn seems like it should be avoidable. Yet on it ground with sickening inevitability. It's just now finally starting to reach critical mass and become visible to the more general public, spreading through the same tech grapevine that gave them such a boost in the first place. But less academically it's depressing as hell too, because the grapevine liked them for good reason and there still isn't any drop in replacement. Their p2p/p2mp gear is still solid. And UniFi was a wonderful concept solidly executed. It also eschewed the subscription/cloud bullshit so many other players are chasing, which indeed is something of a saving grace here. While there is a cloud option, lots (if not most) people can and do run their UniFi networks completely self-hosted even for remote sites. The single pane of glass, ease of provisioning and recovery, etc made sense and saved time. And they had an incredibly enthusiastic and supportive community, like when they asked about moving L3 switching way back on the old forums (back when the rot was in its earliest stages and not clear yet) they got huge amounts of feedback, their beta testing had many people putting in a lot of good work. Such a damn stupid waste. And the nature of the beast for tech infrastructure is that market signals are always behind the curve and thus muted until things are already getting to be too late. Robert Pera also owns the majority of their stock IIRC so there isn't any way to effect an outside management change there either. It is odd to me that nobody has sought to go after them directly and aggressively, though I heard rumblings late last year that Cisco was giving a go at something clearly aimed right at the UniFi market (no subscriptions like Meraki)? At any rate, final straw for me on routing was the flop their "UXG" has been, I finally gave up at long last and began migrating everything to OPNsense a month back. And once the single pane of glass is broken, the barrier to start moving more drops in turn and network effects (harhar) begin to go into reverse. I'd still be happy if they somehow recovered, but if they do I think it'll be a long time. Problems that build for years tend to take years to reverse too, if they can be. I hope we get some stories someday internally on how it all went down. | | --- | --- | --- | | | |  |  | [eqvinox](user?id=eqvinox) [on March 30, 2021](item?id=26638891)   | [prev](#26638859) | [next](#26642423) [–]  I am extremely relieved none of our Ubiquiti devices are set up for this cloud shit.

I've used all 3 as my primary device on my network running OpenWRT. I bought the TP-Link first. It worked, but it's an underpowered device and it was struggling to keep up with all the devices on my network. It also has a MIPS chip so it couldn't some ARM only software I wanted to use. I replaced it with the Linksys. I had nothing but problems with it. It was fast and reliable using the Linksys firmware (but functionality was severely limited). When running OpenWRT it was a buggy disaster. One example problem, it would randomly start dropping bonjour packets for no explicable reason thus preventing my wife from being able to print from her iPhone. It had to go. I was about ready to give up on my OpenWRT dream, but I took one last chance and bought the Netgear for cheap off of eBay. It's great. It's fast, it's reliable, and so far it just works (been running it for a year now). So the C7 is good if your needs are limited, but I really do recommend the R7800.

   Privacy Extensions for Stateless Address Autoconfiguration in IPv6

Status of This Memo

   This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
   Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
   improvements.  Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
   Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
   and status of this protocol.  Distribution of this memo is unlimited.

Abstract

   Nodes use IPv6 stateless address autoconfiguration to generate
   addresses using a combination of locally available information and
   information advertised by routers.  Addresses are formed by combining
   network prefixes with an interface identifier.  On an interface that
   contains an embedded IEEE Identifier, the interface identifier is
   typically derived from it.  On other interface types, the interface
   identifier is generated through other means, for example, via random
   number generation.  This document describes an extension to IPv6
   stateless address autoconfiguration for interfaces whose interface
   identifier is derived from an IEEE identifier.  Use of the extension
   causes nodes to generate global scope addresses from interface
   identifiers that change over time, even in cases where the interface
   contains an embedded IEEE identifier.  Changing the interface
   identifier (and the global scope addresses generated from it) over
   time makes it more difficult for eavesdroppers and other information
   collectors to identify when different addresses used in different
   transactions actually correspond to the same node.

[RFC 4941](/doc/html/rfc4941)             Privacy Extensions to Autoconf       September 2007

[1](#section-1).  Introduction

   Stateless address autoconfiguration [[ADDRCONF](#ref-ADDRCONF "\"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"")] defines how an IPv6
   node generates addresses without the need for a Dynamic Host
   Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6) server.  Some types of
   network interfaces come with an embedded IEEE Identifier (i.e., a
   link-layer MAC address), and in those cases, stateless address
   autoconfiguration uses the IEEE identifier to generate a 64-bit
   interface identifier [[ADDRARCH](#ref-ADDRARCH "\"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture\"")].  By design, the interface identifier
   is likely to be globally unique when generated in this fashion.  The
   interface identifier is in turn appended to a prefix to form a
   128-bit IPv6 address.  Note that an IPv6 identifier does not
   necessarily have to be 64 bits in length, but the algorithm specified
   in this document is targeted towards 64-bit interface identifiers.

   All nodes combine interface identifiers (whether derived from an IEEE
   identifier or generated through some other technique) with the
   reserved link-local prefix to generate link-local addresses for their
   attached interfaces.  Additional addresses can then be created by
   combining prefixes advertised in Router Advertisements via Neighbor
   Discovery [[DISCOVERY](#ref-DISCOVERY "\"Neighbor Discovery for IP version 6 (IPv6)\"")] with the interface identifier.

   Not all nodes and interfaces contain IEEE identifiers.  In such
   cases, an interface identifier is generated through some other means
   (e.g., at random), and the resultant interface identifier may not be
   globally unique and may also change over time.  The focus of this
   document is on addresses derived from IEEE identifiers because
   tracking of individual devices, the concern being addressed here, is
   possible only in those cases where the interface identifier is
   globally unique and non-changing.  The rest of this document assumes
   that IEEE identifiers are being used, but the techniques described
   may also apply to interfaces with other types of globally unique
   and/or persistent identifiers.

   This document discusses concerns associated with the embedding of
   non-changing interface identifiers within IPv6 addresses and
   describes extensions to stateless address autoconfiguration that can
   help mitigate those concerns for individual users and in environments
   where such concerns are significant.  [Section 2](#section-2) provides background

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [[RFC2119](/doc/html/rfc2119 "\"Key words for use in RFCs to Indicate Requirement Levels\"")].

[1.2](#section-1.2).  Problem Statement

   Addresses generated using stateless address autoconfiguration
   [[ADDRCONF](#ref-ADDRCONF "\"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"")] contain an embedded interface identifier, which remains
   constant over time.  Anytime a fixed identifier is used in multiple
   contexts, it becomes possible to correlate seemingly unrelated
   activity using this identifier.

   The correlation can be performed by

   o  An attacker who is in the path between the node in question and
      the peer(s) to which it is communicating, and who can view the
      IPv6 addresses present in the datagrams.

   o  An attacker who can access the communication logs of the peers
      with which the node has communicated.

   Since the identifier is embedded within the IPv6 address, which is a
   fundamental requirement of communication, it cannot be easily hidden.
   This document proposes a solution to this issue by generating
   interface identifiers that vary over time.

   Note that an attacker, who is on path, may be able to perform
   significant correlation based on

   o  The payload contents of the packets on the wire

   o  The characteristics of the packets such as packet size and timing

   Use of temporary addresses will not prevent such payload-based
   correlation.

[2](#section-2).  Background

   This section discusses the problem in more detail, provides context
   for evaluating the significance of the concerns in specific
   environments and makes comparisons with existing practices.

[2.1](#section-2.1).  Extended Use of the Same Identifier

   The use of a non-changing interface identifier to form addresses is a
   specific instance of the more general case where a constant
   identifier is reused over an extended period of time and in multiple
   independent activities.  Any time the same identifier is used in
   multiple contexts, it becomes possible for that identifier to be used
   to correlate seemingly unrelated activity.  For example, a network
   sniffer placed strategically on a link across which all traffic to/
   from a particular host crosses could keep track of which destinations
   a node communicated with and at what times.  Such information can in
   some cases be used to infer things, such as what hours an employee
   was active, when someone is at home, etc.  Although it might appear
   that changing an address regularly in such environments would be
   desirable to lessen privacy concerns, it should be noted that the
   network prefix portion of an address also serves as a constant
   identifier.  All nodes at, say, a home, would have the same network
   prefix, which identifies the topological location of those nodes.
   This has implications for privacy, though not at the same granularity
   as the concern that this document addresses.  Specifically, all nodes
   within a home could be grouped together for the purposes of
   collecting information.  If the network contains a very small number
   of nodes, say, just one, changing just the interface identifier will
   not enhance privacy at all, since the prefix serves as a constant
   identifier.

   One of the requirements for correlating seemingly unrelated
   activities is the use (and reuse) of an identifier that is
   recognizable over time within different contexts.  IP addresses
   provide one obvious example, but there are more.  Many nodes also
   have DNS names associated with their addresses, in which case the DNS
   name serves as a similar identifier.  Although the DNS name
   associated with an address is more work to obtain (it may require a
   DNS query), the information is often readily available.  In such
   cases, changing the address on a machine over time would do little to
   address the concerns raised in this document, unless the DNS name is
   changed as well (see [Section 4](#section-4)).

   Web browsers and servers typically exchange "cookies" with each other
   [[COOKIES](#ref-COOKIES "\"HTTP State Management Mechanism\"")].  Cookies allow Web servers to correlate a current activity
   with a previous activity.  One common usage is to send back targeted
   advertising to a user by using the cookie supplied by the browser to

   identify what earlier queries had been made (e.g., for what type of
   information).  Based on the earlier queries, advertisements can be
   targeted to match the (assumed) interests of the end user.

   The use of a constant identifier within an address is of special
   concern because addresses are a fundamental requirement of
   communication and cannot easily be hidden from eavesdroppers and
   other parties.  Even when higher layers encrypt their payloads,
   addresses in packet headers appear in the clear.  Consequently, if a
   mobile host (e.g., laptop) accessed the network from several
   different locations, an eavesdropper might be able to track the
   movement of that mobile host from place to place, even if the upper
   layer payloads were encrypted.

[2.2](#section-2.2).  Address Usage in IPv4 Today

   Addresses used in today's Internet are often non-changing in practice
   for extended periods of time.  In an increasing number of sites,
   addresses are assigned statically and typically change infrequently.
   Over the last few years, sites have begun moving away from static
   allocation to dynamic allocation via DHCP [[DHCP](#ref-DHCP "\"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol\"")].  In theory, the
   address a client gets via DHCP can change over time, but in practice
   servers often return the same address to the same client (unless
   addresses are in such short supply that they are reused immediately
   by a different node when they become free).  Thus, even within sites
   using DHCP, clients frequently end up using the same address for
   weeks to months at a time.

   For home users accessing the Internet over dial-up lines, the
   situation is generally different.  Such users do not have permanent
   connections and are often assigned temporary addresses each time they
   connect to their ISP.  Consequently, the addresses they use change
   frequently over time and are shared among a number of different
   users.  Thus, an address does not reliably identify a particular
   device over time spans of more than a few minutes.

   A more interesting case concerns always-on connections (e.g., cable
   modems, ISDN, DSL, etc.) that result in a home site using the same
   address for extended periods of time.  This is a scenario that is
   just starting to become common in IPv4 and promises to become more of
   a concern as always-on Internet connectivity becomes widely
   available.

   Finally, it should be noted that nodes that need a (non-changing) DNS
   name generally have static addresses assigned to them to simplify the
   configuration of DNS servers.  Although Dynamic DNS [[DDNS](#ref-DDNS "\"Dynamic Updates in the Domain Name System (DNS UPDATE)\"")] can be
   used to update the DNS dynamically, it may not always be available
   depending on the administrative policy.  In addition, changing an

   address but keeping the same DNS name does not really address the
   underlying concern, since the DNS name becomes a non-changing
   identifier.  Servers generally require a DNS name (so clients can
   connect to them), and clients often do as well (e.g., some servers
   refuse to speak to a client whose address cannot be mapped into a DNS
   name that also maps back into the same address).  [Section 4](#section-4) describes
   one approach to this issue.

[2.3](#section-2.3).  The Concern with IPv6 Addresses

   The division of IPv6 addresses into distinct topology and interface
   identifier portions raises an issue new to IPv6 in that a fixed
   portion of an IPv6 address (i.e., the interface identifier) can
   contain an identifier that remains constant even when the topology
   portion of an address changes (e.g., as the result of connecting to a
   different part of the Internet).  In IPv4, when an address changes,
   the entire address (including the local part of the address) usually
   changes.  It is this new issue that this document addresses.

   If addresses are generated from an interface identifier, a home
   user's address could contain an interface identifier that remains the
   same from one dial-up session to the next, even if the rest of the
   address changes.  The way PPP is used today, however, PPP servers
   typically unilaterally inform the client what address they are to use
   (i.e., the client doesn't generate one on its own).  This practice,
   if continued in IPv6, would avoid the concerns that are the focus of
   this document.

   A more troubling case concerns mobile devices (e.g., laptops, PDAs,
   etc.) that move topologically within the Internet.  Whenever they
   move, they form new addresses for their current topological point of
   attachment.  This is typified today by the "road warrior" who has
   Internet connectivity both at home and at the office.  While the
   node's address changes as it moves, the interface identifier
   contained within the address remains the same (when derived from an
   IEEE Identifier).  In such cases, the interface identifier can be
   used to track the movement and usage of a particular machine.  For
   example, a server that logs usage information together with source
   addresses, is also recording the interface identifier since it is
   embedded within an address.  Consequently, any data-mining technique
   that correlates activity based on addresses could easily be extended
   to do the same using the interface identifier.  This is of particular
   concern with the expected proliferation of next-generation network-
   connected devices (e.g., PDAs, cell phones, etc.) in which large
   numbers of devices are, in practice, associated with individual users
   (i.e., not shared).  Thus, the interface identifier embedded within
   an address could be used to track activities of an individual, even
   as they move topologically within the Internet.

[RFC 4941](/doc/html/rfc4941)             Privacy Extensions to Autoconf       September 2007

   In summary, IPv6 addresses on a given interface generated via
   Stateless Autoconfiguration contain the same interface identifier,
   regardless of where within the Internet the device connects.  This
   facilitates the tracking of individual devices (and thus,
   potentially, users).  The purpose of this document is to define
   mechanisms that eliminate this issue in those situations where it is
   a concern.

[2.4](#section-2.4).  Possible Approaches

   One way to avoid having a static non-changing address is to use
   DHCPv6 [[DHCPV6](#ref-DHCPV6 "\"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)\"")] for obtaining addresses.  Section 12 of [[DHCPV6](#ref-DHCPV6 "\"Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6 (DHCPv6)\"")]
   discusses the use of DHCPv6 for the assignment and management of
   "temporary addresses", which are never renewed and provide the same
   property of temporary addresses described in this document with
   regards to the privacy concern.

   Another approach, compatible with the stateless address
   autoconfiguration architecture, would be to change the interface
   identifier portion of an address over time and generate new addresses
   from the interface identifier for some address scopes.  Changing the
   interface identifier can make it more difficult to look at the IP
   addresses in independent transactions and identify which ones
   actually correspond to the same node, both in the case where the
   routing prefix portion of an address changes and when it does not.

   Many machines function as both clients and servers.  In such cases,
   the machine would need a DNS name for its use as a server.  Whether
   the address stays fixed or changes has little privacy implication
   since the DNS name remains constant and serves as a constant
   identifier.  When acting as a client (e.g., initiating
   communication), however, such a machine may want to vary the
   addresses it uses.  In such environments, one may need multiple
   addresses: a "public" (i.e., non-secret) server address, registered
   in the DNS, that is used to accept incoming connection requests from
   other machines, and a "temporary" address used to shield the identity
   of the client when it initiates communication.  These two cases are
   roughly analogous to telephone numbers and caller ID, where a user
   may list their telephone number in the public phone book, but disable
   the display of its number via caller ID when initiating calls.

   To make it difficult to make educated guesses as to whether two
   different interface identifiers belong to the same node, the
   algorithm for generating alternate identifiers must include input
   that has an unpredictable component from the perspective of the
   outside entities that are collecting information.  Picking
   identifiers from a pseudo-random sequence suffices, so long as the
   specific sequence cannot be determined by an outsider examining

   information that is readily available or easily determinable (e.g.,
   by examining packet contents).  This document proposes the generation
   of a pseudo-random sequence of interface identifiers via an MD5 hash.
   Periodically, the next interface identifier in the sequence is
   generated, a new set of temporary addresses is created, and the
   previous temporary addresses are deprecated to discourage their
   further use.  The precise pseudo-random sequence depends on both a
   random component and the globally unique interface identifier (when
   available), to increase the likelihood that different nodes generate
   different sequences.

[3](#section-3).  Protocol Description

   The goal of this section is to define procedures that:

   1.  Do not result in any changes to the basic behavior of addresses
       generated via stateless address autoconfiguration [[ADDRCONF](#ref-ADDRCONF "\"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"")].

   2.  Create additional addresses based on a random interface
       identifier for the purpose of initiating outgoing sessions.
       These "random" or temporary addresses would be used for a short
       period of time (hours to days) and would then be deprecated.
       Deprecated address can continue to be used for already
       established connections, but are not used to initiate new
       connections.  New temporary addresses are generated periodically
       to replace temporary addresses that expire, with the exact time
       between address generation a matter of local policy.

   3.  Produce a sequence of temporary global scope addresses from a
       sequence of interface identifiers that appear to be random in the
       sense that it is difficult for an outside observer to predict a
       future address (or identifier) based on a current one, and it is
       difficult to determine previous addresses (or identifiers)
       knowing only the present one.

   4.  By default, generate a set of addresses from the same
       (randomized) interface identifier, one address for each prefix
       for which a global address has been generated via stateless
       address autoconfiguration.  Using the same interface identifier
       to generate a set of temporary addresses reduces the number of IP
       multicast groups a host must join.  Nodes join the solicited-node
       multicast address for each unicast address they support, and
       solicited-node addresses are dependent only on the low-order bits
       of the corresponding address.  This default behavior was made to
       address the concern that a node that joins a large number of
       multicast groups may be required to put its interface into
       promiscuous mode, resulting in possible reduced performance.

[RFC 4941](/doc/html/rfc4941)             Privacy Extensions to Autoconf       September 2007

       A node highly concerned about privacy MAY use different interface
       identifiers on different prefixes, resulting in a set of global
       addresses that cannot be easily tied to each other.  For example
       a node MAY create different interface identifiers I1, I2, and I3
       for use with different prefixes P1, P2, and P3 on the same
       interface.

[3.1](#section-3.1).  Assumptions

   The following algorithm assumes that each interface maintains an
   associated randomized interface identifier.  When temporary addresses
   are generated, the current value of the associated randomized
   interface identifier is used.  While the same identifier can be used
   to create more than one temporary address, the value SHOULD change
   over time as described in [Section 3.5](#section-3.5).

   The algorithm also assumes that, for a given temporary address, an
   implementation can determine the prefix from which it was generated.
   When a temporary address is deprecated, a new temporary address is
   generated.  The specific valid and preferred lifetimes for the new
   address are dependent on the corresponding lifetime values set for
   the prefix from which it was generated.

   Finally, this document assumes that when a node initiates outgoing
   communication, temporary addresses can be given preference over
   public addresses when the device is configured to do so.
   [[ADDR_SELECT](#ref-ADDR_SELECT "\"Default Address Selection for Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6)\"")] mandates implementations to provide a mechanism, which
   allows an application to configure its preference for temporary
   addresses over public addresses.  It also allows for an
   implementation to prefer temporary addresses by default, so that the
   connections initiated by the node can use temporary addresses without
   requiring application-specific enablement.  This document also
   assumes that an API will exist that allows individual applications to
   indicate whether they prefer to use temporary or public addresses and
   override the system defaults.

[3.2](#section-3.2).  Generation of Randomized Interface Identifiers

   We describe two approaches for the generation and maintenance of the
   randomized interface identifier.  The first assumes the presence of
   stable storage that can be used to record state history for use as
   input into the next iteration of the algorithm across system
   restarts.  A second approach addresses the case where stable storage
   is unavailable and there is a need to generate randomized interface
   identifiers without previous state.

[RFC 4941](/doc/html/rfc4941)             Privacy Extensions to Autoconf       September 2007

   The random interface identifier generation algorithm, as described in
   this document, uses MD5 as the hash algorithm.  The node MAY use
   another algorithm instead of MD5 to produce the random interface
   identifier.

[3.2.1](#section-3.2.1).  When Stable Storage Is Present

   The following algorithm assumes the presence of a 64-bit "history
   value" that is used as input in generating a randomized interface
   identifier.  The very first time the system boots (i.e., out-of-the-
   box), a random value SHOULD be generated using techniques that help
   ensure the initial value is hard to guess [[RANDOM](#ref-RANDOM "\"Randomness Requirements for Security\"")].  Whenever a new
   interface identifier is generated, a value generated by the
   computation is saved in the history value for the next iteration of
   the algorithm.

   A randomized interface identifier is created as follows:

   1.  Take the history value from the previous iteration of this
       algorithm (or a random value if there is no previous value) and
       append to it the interface identifier generated as described in
       [[ADDRARCH](#ref-ADDRARCH "\"IP Version 6 Addressing Architecture\"")].

   2.  Compute the MD5 message digest [[MD5](#ref-MD5 "\"The MD5 Message-Digest Algorithm\"")] over the quantity created in
       the previous step.

   3.  Take the leftmost 64-bits of the MD5 digest and set bit 6 (the
       leftmost bit is numbered 0) to zero.  This creates an interface
       identifier with the universal/local bit indicating local
       significance only.

   4.  Compare the generated identifier against a list of reserved
       interface identifiers and to those already assigned to an address
       on the local device.  In the event that an unacceptable
       identifier has been generated, the node MUST restart the process
       at step 1 above, using the rightmost 64 bits of the MD5 digest
       obtained in step 2 in place of the history value in step 1.

   5.  Save the generated identifier as the associated randomized
       interface identifier.

   6.  Take the rightmost 64-bits of the MD5 digest computed in step 2)
       and save them in stable storage as the history value to be used
       in the next iteration of the algorithm.

[RFC 4941](/doc/html/rfc4941)             Privacy Extensions to Autoconf       September 2007

   MD5 was chosen for convenience, and because its particular properties
   were adequate to produce the desired level of randomization.  The
   node MAY use another algorithm instead of MD5 to produce the random
   interface identifier

   In theory, generating successive randomized interface identifiers
   using a history scheme as above has no advantages over generating
   them at random.  In practice, however, generating truly random
   numbers can be tricky.  Use of a history value is intended to avoid
   the particular scenario where two nodes generate the same randomized
   interface identifier, both detect the situation via DAD, but then
   proceed to generate identical randomized interface identifiers via
   the same (flawed) random number generation algorithm.  The above
   algorithm avoids this problem by having the interface identifier
   (which will often be globally unique) used in the calculation that
   generates subsequent randomized interface identifiers.  Thus, if two
   nodes happen to generate the same randomized interface identifier,
   they should generate different ones on the follow-up attempt.

[3.2.2](#section-3.2.2).  In The Absence of Stable Storage

   In the absence of stable storage, no history value will be available
   across system restarts to generate a pseudo-random sequence of
   interface identifiers.  Consequently, the initial history value used
   above SHOULD be generated at random.  A number of techniques might be
   appropriate.  Consult [[RANDOM](#ref-RANDOM "\"Randomness Requirements for Security\"")] for suggestions on good sources for
   obtaining random numbers.  Note that even though machines may not
   have stable storage for storing a history value, they will in many
   cases have configuration information that differs from one machine to
   another (e.g., user identity, security keys, serial numbers, etc.).
   One approach to generating a random initial history value in such
   cases is to use the configuration information to generate some data
   bits (which may remain constant for the life of the machine, but will
   vary from one machine to another), append some random data, and
   compute the MD5 digest as before.

[3.2.3](#section-3.2.3).  Alternate Approaches

   Note that there are other approaches to generate random interface
   identifiers, albeit with different goals and applicability.  One such
   approach is Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGAs) [[CGA](#ref-CGA "\"Cryptographically Generated Addresses (CGA)\"")], which
   generate a random interface identifier based on the public key of the
   node.  The goal of CGAs is to prove ownership of an address and to
   prevent spoofing and stealing of existing IPv6 addresses.  They are
   used for securing neighbor discovery using [[SEND](#ref-SEND "\"SEcure Neighbor Discovery (SEND)\"")].  The CGA random
   interface identifier generation algorithm may not be suitable for
   privacy addresses because of the following properties:

   o  It requires the node to have a public key.  This means that the
      node can still be identified by its public key.

   o  The random interface identifier process is computationally
      intensive and hence discourages frequent regeneration.

[3.3](#section-3.3).  Generating Temporary Addresses

   [ADDRCONF] describes the steps for generating a link-local address
   when an interface becomes enabled as well as the steps for generating
   addresses for other scopes.  This document extends [[ADDRCONF](#ref-ADDRCONF "\"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"")] as
   follows.  When processing a Router Advertisement with a Prefix
   Information option carrying a global scope prefix for the purposes of
   address autoconfiguration (i.e., the A bit is set), the node MUST
   perform the following steps:

   1.  Process the Prefix Information Option as defined in [[ADDRCONF](#ref-ADDRCONF "\"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"")],
       either creating a new public address or adjusting the lifetimes
       of existing addresses, both public and temporary.  If a received
       option will extend the lifetime of a public address, the
       lifetimes of temporary addresses should be extended, subject to
       the overall constraint that no temporary addresses should ever
       remain "valid" or "preferred" for a time longer than
       (TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME) or (TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME -
       DESYNC_FACTOR), respectively.  The configuration variables
       TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME and TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME correspond to
       approximate target lifetimes for temporary addresses.

   2.  One way an implementation can satisfy the above constraints is to
       associate with each temporary address a creation time (called
       CREATION_TIME) that indicates the time at which the address was
       created.  When updating the preferred lifetime of an existing
       temporary address, it would be set to expire at whichever time is
       earlier: the time indicated by the received lifetime or
       (CREATION_TIME + TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME - DESYNC_FACTOR).  A
       similar approach can be used with the valid lifetime.

   3.  When a new public address is created as described in [[ADDRCONF](#ref-ADDRCONF "\"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"")],
       the node SHOULD also create a new temporary address.

   4.  When creating a temporary address, the lifetime values MUST be
       derived from the corresponding prefix as follows:

       *  Its Valid Lifetime is the lower of the Valid Lifetime of the
          public address or TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME.

          DESYNC_FACTOR.

   5.  A temporary address is created only if this calculated Preferred
       Lifetime is greater than REGEN_ADVANCE time units.  In
       particular, an implementation MUST NOT create a temporary address
       with a zero Preferred Lifetime.

   6.  New temporary addresses MUST be created by appending the
       interface's current randomized interface identifier to the prefix
       that was received.

   7.  The node MUST perform duplicate address detection (DAD) on the
       generated temporary address.  If DAD indicates the address is
       already in use, the node MUST generate a new randomized interface
       identifier as described in [Section 3.2](#section-3.2) above, and repeat the
       previous steps as appropriate up to TEMP_IDGEN_RETRIES times.  If
       after TEMP_IDGEN_RETRIES consecutive attempts no non-unique
       address was generated, the node MUST log a system error and MUST
       NOT attempt to generate temporary addresses for that interface.
       Note that DAD MUST be performed on every unicast address
       generated from this randomized interface identifier.

[3.4](#section-3.4).  Expiration of Temporary Addresses

   When a temporary address becomes deprecated, a new one MUST be
   generated.  This is done by repeating the actions described in
   [Section 3.3](#section-3.3), starting at step 3).  Note that, except for the
   transient period when a temporary address is being regenerated, in
   normal operation at most one temporary address per prefix should be
   in a non-deprecated state at any given time on a given interface.
   Note that if a temporary address becomes deprecated as result of
   processing a Prefix Information Option with a zero Preferred
   Lifetime, then a new temporary address MUST NOT be generated.  To
   ensure that a preferred temporary address is always available, a new
   temporary address SHOULD be regenerated slightly before its
   predecessor is deprecated.  This is to allow sufficient time to avoid
   race conditions in the case where generating a new temporary address
   is not instantaneous, such as when duplicate address detection must
   be run.  The node SHOULD start the address regeneration process
   REGEN_ADVANCE time units before a temporary address would actually be
   deprecated.

   As an optional optimization, an implementation MAY remove a
   deprecated temporary address that is not in use by applications or
   upper layers as detailed in [Section 6](#section-6).

[3.5](#section-3.5).  Regeneration of Randomized Interface Identifiers

   The frequency at which temporary addresses changes depends on how a
   device is being used (e.g., how frequently it initiates new
   communication) and the concerns of the end user.  The most egregious
   privacy concerns appear to involve addresses used for long periods of
   time (weeks to months to years).  The more frequently an address
   changes, the less feasible collecting or coordinating information
   keyed on interface identifiers becomes.  Moreover, the cost of
   collecting information and attempting to correlate it based on
   interface identifiers will only be justified if enough addresses
   contain non-changing identifiers to make it worthwhile.  Thus, having
   large numbers of clients change their address on a daily or weekly
   basis is likely to be sufficient to alleviate most privacy concerns.

   There are also client costs associated with having a large number of
   addresses associated with a node (e.g., in doing address lookups, the
   need to join many multicast groups, etc.).  Thus, changing addresses
   frequently (e.g., every few minutes) may have performance
   implications.

   Nodes following this specification SHOULD generate new temporary
   addresses on a periodic basis.  This can be achieved automatically by
   generating a new randomized interface identifier at least once every
   (TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME - REGEN_ADVANCE - DESYNC_FACTOR) time units.
   As described above, generating a new temporary address REGEN_ADVANCE
   time units before a temporary address becomes deprecated produces
   addresses with a preferred lifetime no larger than
   TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME.  The value DESYNC_FACTOR is a random value
   (different for each client) that ensures that clients don't
   synchronize with each other and generate new addresses at exactly the
   same time.  When the preferred lifetime expires, a new temporary
   address MUST be generated using the new randomized interface
   identifier.

   Because the precise frequency at which it is appropriate to generate
   new addresses varies from one environment to another, implementations
   SHOULD provide end users with the ability to change the frequency at
   which addresses are regenerated.  The default value is given in
   TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME and is one day.  In addition, the exact time
   at which to invalidate a temporary address depends on how
   applications are used by end users.  Thus, the suggested default
   value of one week (TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME) may not be appropriate in all
   environments.  Implementations SHOULD provide end users with the
   ability to override both of these default values.

[RFC 4941](/doc/html/rfc4941)             Privacy Extensions to Autoconf       September 2007

   Finally, when an interface connects to a new link, a new randomized
   interface identifier SHOULD be generated immediately together with a
   new set of temporary addresses.  If a device moves from one ethernet
   to another, generating a new set of temporary addresses from a
   different randomized interface identifier ensures that the device
   uses different randomized interface identifiers for the temporary
   addresses associated with the two links, making it more difficult to
   correlate addresses from the two different links as being from the
   same node.  The node MAY follow any process available to it, to
   determine that the link change has occurred.  One such process is
   described by Detecting Network Attachment [[DNA](#ref-DNA "\"Goals of Detecting Network Attachment in IPv6\"")].

[3.6](#section-3.6).  Deployment Considerations

   Devices implementing this specification MUST provide a way for the
   end user to explicitly enable or disable the use of temporary
   addresses.  In addition, a site might wish to disable the use of
   temporary addresses in order to simplify network debugging and
   operations.  Consequently, implementations SHOULD provide a way for
   trusted system administrators to enable or disable the use of
   temporary addresses.

   Additionally, sites might wish to selectively enable or disable the
   use of temporary addresses for some prefixes.  For example, a site
   might wish to disable temporary address generation for "Unique local"
   [[ULA](#ref-ULA "\"Unique Local IPv6 Unicast Addresses\"")] prefixes while still generating temporary addresses for all
   other global prefixes.  Another site might wish to enable temporary
   address generation only for the prefixes 2001::/16 and 2002::/16,
   while disabling it for all other prefixes.  To support this behavior,
   implementations SHOULD provide a way to enable and disable generation
   of temporary addresses for specific prefix subranges.  This per-
   prefix setting SHOULD override the global settings on the node with
   respect to the specified prefix subranges.  Note that the pre-prefix
   setting can be applied at any granularity, and not necessarily on a
   per-subnet basis.

   The use of temporary addresses may cause unexpected difficulties with
   some applications.  As described below, some servers refuse to accept
   communications from clients for which they cannot map the IP address
   into a DNS name.  In addition, some applications may not behave
   robustly if temporary addresses are used and an address expires
   before the application has terminated, or if it opens multiple
   sessions, but expects them to all use the same addresses.
   Consequently, the use of temporary addresses SHOULD be disabled by
   default in order to minimize potential disruptions.  Individual
   applications, which have specific knowledge about the normal duration
   of connections, MAY override this as appropriate.

[RFC 4941](/doc/html/rfc4941)             Privacy Extensions to Autoconf       September 2007

   If a very small number of nodes (say, only one) use a given prefix
   for extended periods of time, just changing the interface identifier
   part of the address may not be sufficient to ensure privacy, since
   the prefix acts as a constant identifier.  The procedures described
   in this document are most effective when the prefix is reasonably non
   static or is used by a fairly large number of nodes.

[4](#section-4).  Implications of Changing Interface Identifiers

   The IPv6 addressing architecture goes to some lengths to ensure that
   interface identifiers are likely to be globally unique where easy to
   do so.  The widespread use of temporary addresses may result in a
   significant fraction of Internet traffic not using addresses in which
   the interface identifier portion is globally unique.  Consequently,
   usage of the algorithms in this document may complicate providing
   such a future flexibility, if global uniqueness is necessary.

   The desires of protecting individual privacy versus the desire to
   effectively maintain and debug a network can conflict with each
   other.  Having clients use addresses that change over time will make
   it more difficult to track down and isolate operational problems.
   For example, when looking at packet traces, it could become more
   difficult to determine whether one is seeing behavior caused by a
   single errant machine, or by a number of them.

   Some servers refuse to grant access to clients for which no DNS name
   exists.  That is, they perform a DNS PTR query to determine the DNS
   name, and may then also perform an AAAA query on the returned name to
   verify that the returned DNS name maps back into the address being
   used.  Consequently, clients not properly registered in the DNS may
   be unable to access some services.  As noted earlier, however, a
   node's DNS name (if non-changing) serves as a constant identifier.
   The wide deployment of the extension described in this document could
   challenge the practice of inverse-DNS-based "authentication," which
   has little validity, though it is widely implemented.  In order to
   meet server challenges, nodes could register temporary addresses in
   the DNS using random names (for example, a string version of the
   random address itself).

   Use of the extensions defined in this document may complicate
   debugging and other operational troubleshooting activities.
   Consequently, it may be site policy that temporary addresses should
   not be used.  Consequently, implementations MUST provide a method for
   the end user or trusted administrator to override the use of
   temporary addresses.

[5](#section-5).  Defined Constants

   Constants defined in this document include:

   TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME -- Default value: 1 week.  Users should be able
   to override the default value.

   TEMP_PREFERRED_LIFETIME -- Default value: 1 day.  Users should be
   able to override the default value.

   REGEN_ADVANCE -- 5 seconds

   MAX_DESYNC_FACTOR -- 10 minutes.  Upper bound on DESYNC_FACTOR.

   DESYNC_FACTOR -- A random value within the range 0 -
   MAX_DESYNC_FACTOR.  It is computed once at system start (rather than
   each time it is used) and must never be greater than
   (TEMP_VALID_LIFETIME - REGEN_ADVANCE).

   TEMP_IDGEN_RETRIES -- Default value: 3

[6](#section-6).  Future Work

   An implementation might want to keep track of which addresses are
   being used by upper layers so as to be able to remove a deprecated
   temporary address from internal data structures once no upper layer
   protocols are using it (but not before).  This is in contrast to
   current approaches where addresses are removed from an interface when
   they become invalid [[ADDRCONF](#ref-ADDRCONF "\"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"")], independent of whether or not upper
   layer protocols are still using them.  For TCP connections, such
   information is available in control blocks.  For UDP-based
   applications, it may be the case that only the applications have
   knowledge about what addresses are actually in use.  Consequently, an
   implementation generally will need to use heuristics in deciding when
   an address is no longer in use.

   The determination as to whether to use public versus temporary
   addresses can in some cases only be made by an application.  For
   example, some applications may always want to use temporary
   addresses, while others may want to use them only in some
   circumstances or not at all.  Suitable API extensions will likely
   need to be developed to enable individual applications to indicate
   with sufficient granularity their needs with regards to the use of
   temporary addresses.  Recommendations on DNS practices to avoid the
   problem described in [Section 4](#section-4) when reverse DNS lookups fail may be
   needed.  [[DNSOP](#ref-DNSOP "\"Operational Considerations and Issues with IPv6 DNS\"")] contains a more detailed discussion of the DNS-
   related issues.

[RFC 4941](/doc/html/rfc4941)             Privacy Extensions to Autoconf       September 2007

   While this document discusses ways of obscuring a user's permanent IP
   address, the method described is believed to be ineffective against
   sophisticated forms of traffic analysis.  To increase effectiveness,
   one may need to consider use of more advanced techniques, such as
   Onion Routing [[ONION](#ref-ONION "\"Proxies for Anonymous Routing\"")].

[7](#section-7).  Security Considerations

   Ingress filtering has been and is being deployed as a means of
   preventing the use of spoofed source addresses in Distributed Denial
   of Service (DDoS) attacks.  In a network with a large number of
   nodes, new temporary addresses are created at a fairly high rate.
   This might make it difficult for ingress filtering mechanisms to
   distinguish between legitimately changing temporary addresses and
   spoofed source addresses, which are "in-prefix" (using a
   topologically correct prefix and non-existent interface ID).  This
   can be addressed by using access control mechanisms on a per-address
   basis on the network egress point.

[8](#section-8).  Significant Changes from [RFC 3041](/doc/html/rfc3041)

   This section summarizes the changes in this document relative to [RFC](/doc/html/rfc3041)
   [3041](/doc/html/rfc3041) that an implementer of [RFC 3041](/doc/html/rfc3041) should be aware of.

   1.  Excluded certain interface identifiers from the range of
       acceptable interface identifiers.  Interface IDs such as those
       for reserved anycast addresses [[RFC2526](/doc/html/rfc2526 "\"Reserved IPv6 Subnet Anycast Addresses\"")], etc.

   2.  Added a configuration knob that provides the end user with a way
       to enable or disable the use of temporary addresses on a per-
       prefix basis.

   3.  Added a check for denial of service attacks using low valid
       lifetimes in router advertisements.

   4.  DAD is now run on all temporary addresses, not just the first one
       generated from an interface identifier.

   5.  Changed the default setting for usage of temporary addresses to
       be disabled.

   6.  The node is now allowed to generate different interface
       identifiers for different prefixes, if it so desires.

   7.  The algorithm used for generating random interface identifiers is
       no longer restricted to just MD5.

   8.  Reduced default number of retries to 3 and added a configuration
       variable.

   9.  Router advertisement (RA) processing algorithm is no longer
       included in the document, and is replaced by a reference to
       [[ADDRCONF](#ref-ADDRCONF "\"IPv6 Stateless Address Autoconfiguration\"")].

## 1. Executive summary

This document discusses the main issues related to the operational practices for the assignment of IPv6 prefixes for end-users.

Making wrong choices when designing your IPv6 network will sooner or later have negative implications for deployment and require further effort such as renumbering when the network is already in operation. The temptation to take “easy” approaches for quicker deployment should therefore be resisted.

As a generic set of recommendations, you should consider the following:

1. **IPv6 is not the same as IPv4**. In IPv6 you assign a short prefix to each end-user site, so they are able to have as many subnets (/64s) as they need. You should not be concerned with exhausting the IPv6 addressing space, and you should think big when planning future requirements. If you need more space, you can go back to your RIR and, providing your addressing plan justifies it, you can obtain more IPv6 addresses.
2. Assigning prefixes longer than /56 is **strongly discouraged**, so your choices are:
   1. If you want a simple addressing plan use a /48 for each end-user. This will work very well for customers coming from other ISPs, those that have their own ULA, or have been using transition mechanisms. This will also be easier when you have a mix of customers using the same infrastructure, whether they are residential customers, SMEs or even large corporates.
   2. Differentiate amongst types of customers, even if this will increase the complexity of your network and those of your customers, by offering /48 for business customers and /56 for residential customers.
   3. A trade-off amongst the previous two options by reserving a /48 for residential customers, but actually just assigning them the first /56.

      There is a specific case for cellular phones to be assigned a single /64 per each PDP context, but this is out of the scope of this document.
3. In order to facilitate troubleshooting and have a future proof network, you should consider **numbering the WAN links using GUAs**, using a /64 prefix out of a dedicated pool of IPv6 prefixes. If you decide to use /127 for each point-to-point link, it is advisable to allocate a /64 for each link and just use one /127 out of it.
4. Non-persistent prefixes are considered harmful in IPv6 as you can't avoid issues that may be caused by simple end-user power outages, so assigning **persistent prefixes is a safer and simpler approach**. Furthermore, this avoids the need for expensive logging, increases your chances to offer new business to customers, and decreases your customer churn.
5. In countries with **specific legal environments**, ISPs are encouraged to support both stable (persistent) and privacy-oriented (non-persistent) prefixes as options for customers. Persistent prefixes are recommended as the default, in the absence of legal requirements to the contrary.

This approach is probably suited for most operator cases. However, we strongly encourage you to read through the rest of this document in order to understand the reasons for these recommendations. This will help you draw your own conclusions, and ensure that your solution matches your specific requirements.

## 2. What is a BCOP?

A Best Current Operational Practices (BCOP) document describes best current operational practice on a particular topic, as agreed by subject matter experts, and is periodically reviewed by the Internet community. This document is not intended to describe what practices may emerge in the future, but to reflect the best methods of implementing IPv6 at the time of publication.

## 3. Introduction and incentives

The target audience of this document are ISPs (technical staff, network architects and other similar departments) who provide or intend to provide IPv6 services to end-users, whether residential or business.

The task of any ISP is to provide its customers with Internet connectivity, which includes providing those customers with IP addresses. Customers generally receive a single IPv4 address, but with IPv6 a customer requires a block of addresses, also known as a prefix. This document provides guidance as to what size such prefixes should be.

Network operators may encounter unexpected or unwanted results if they make wrong decisions when choosing the size of a prefix assignment or the method of assigning it. These negative results may come into effect immediately, e.g. if networks or content providers are measuring the IPv6 “brokenness” and may thus stop serving you AAAA records, or in the future, e.g. when the HOMENET standard results in more complex home networks being built and operated. In these cases, network operators will have to adapt their IPv6 implementations to new requirements, possibly including complete network renumbering, whilst their IPv6 network is already in production and has connected customers.

Up until now, there have been no clear recommendations as to what size of prefixes to choose and assign to customers, hence the decision to document some best current operational practices for network operators to consider when making their decisions.

## 4. Size of end-user prefix assignment: /48, /56 or something else?

Network operators deploying IPv6 will sooner or later need to decide which size of IPv6 prefixes they will assign to their end-users. At this point, numbering decisions that were based on IPv4 scarcity need to be reconsidered because the abundance of IPv6 addresses enables numbering decisions to be taken differently.

Many operators might perceive the assignment of large IPv6 prefixes to end customers as wasteful, but the reality is that decisions should be based on the IPv6 protocol architecture design. For example, Tony Hain calculated that assigning a /48 to every human on Earth, and never recovering those, will still mean that IPv6 would have a lifetime over the 480 years and we could repeat that several times. On that timescale, there will be other reasons, not just scarcity of IPv6 addresses, that will require the IETF to design a successor to IPv6.

### 4.1. Numbering the WAN link (interconnection between the network and the end-user CPE)

Before going into details about the size of IPv6 prefix assignments, the choice for the WAN link needs to be understood. There are three options for addresses on the link between the operator network and the “end-user” CPE WAN port. Note that CE is also commonly used for the CPE (RFC 7084).

#### 4.1.1. /64 prefix from a dedicated pool of IPv6 prefixes

Using a /64 prefix from a dedicated pool of IPv6 prefixes is the most common scenario and currently the best practice. A separate block of IPv6 space is allocated for the WAN links to the end customer CPEs, so that when CPE connects to the network and performs router discovery, a /64 prefix is used to number both ends of the connection.

In the case of an end-user host (not router) connecting over PPPoE (for example), the setup process is concluded when the host is properly IPv6 numbered and can start sending and receiving traffic.

In the case of a router connecting to a network that is capable of issuing a DHCPv6-PD request, the IPv6 prefix delegation process is started and an IPv6 prefix is assigned to the CPE. This method is most probably the safer one, covering most of the scenarios regardless of underlying technologies, and is the one most used by operators.

Some operators also use /126, /127, /112 or an alternative prefix assignment instead of /64 for managed links where addresses on the link are manually configured, and according to RFC 6164, a /127 is suggested to prevent, among others, the [Neighbor Discovery exhaustion attack](https://insinuator.net/2013/03/ipv6-neighbor-cache-exhaustion-attacks-risk-assessment-mitigation-strategies-part-1/ "External link to https://insinuator.net/2013/03/ipv6-neighbor-cache-exhaustion-attacks-risk-assessment-mitigation-strategies-part-1/") (RFC 6583). Please note, that not all equipment currently supports this option, so /64 is still the safest approach and has the advantage of being future proof in the event that new standards make usage of the other 64 bits for other purposes or the link becomes point-to-multipoint, etc. Furthermore, some ISP hardware has limitations in using prefixes longer than /64, so the use of non-/64 prefixes will use more resources on these devices. If we decide to use /127 for each point to point link, then it is also advisable to allocate a /64 for each link and use just one /127 out of it.

Finally, one additional benefit for a dedicated pool, is the possibility to apply security policies without harming the customers. This is only true if customers **always** have a CPE at their end of the WAN link.

#### 4.1.2. Unnumbered

Some operators decide to leave the WAN link to the end-user CPE unnumbered which means no GUA, so only link-local addresses are used at both ends of the link. While this might work for routers, it does not work for devices that cannot request a prefix delegation over DHCPv6 and are therefore left without any usable GUA to allow traffic in and out. In the case of a router on the end customer side, the route for the assigned prefix is pointed towards the link-local address on the CPE/router WAN port and the default route on the CPE/router is pointed towards the link-local address on the upstream network equipment port. This method may be seen as easier to implement, but it also brings some drawbacks such as difficulties with troubleshooting and monitoring that need to be considered. For example, link local addresses do not appear in traceroute, the most common troubleshooting tool used, so you will not be able to easily locate the exact point of failure.

It is most useful in scenarios where it is known that only CPEs will be attached to the WAN link, and where a “pingable” address of the CPE is known (e.g. because the ISP-provided CPEs are always “pingable” on the first delegated address). It is less suitable in situations where unknown CPEs and/or non-CPE devices are attached to the WAN link.

In addition, non-routers (e.g. an older Windows or Linux PC or any other end-user host) connecting to a network that have no ability to ask for prefix delegation over DHCPv6 might experience problems and will stay unnumbered upon connection if a /64 prefix is not used to number the CPE WAN link. This may be also the case for many CPEs, which will not be able to complete the DHCPv6-PD if they got an unnumbered link.

Finally, certain hardware in the ISP infrastructure may consume resources when using numbered links. This is a very specific situation that you may need to consider.

#### 4.1.3. ULA

Some operators use ULAs for numbering the WAN link to the end-user CPE. This approach may cause numerous problems and is therefore **strongly discouraged**. For example, if the CPE needs to send an ICMPv6 message to a host outside an operator's network (to the Internet), the packet with ULA source address will not get very far and PMTUD will break, which in turn will completely break that IPv6 connection when MTU is not the same for all the path.

#### 4.1.4. /64 prefix out of the IPv6 prefix assigned to the end-user

Some operators use the first or last /64 prefix to number the CPE WAN link, from the larger IPv6 prefix assigned to the end customer. This has been described by an expired IETF Internet Draft ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-palet-v6ops-point2point-01](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-palet-v6ops-point2point-01 "External link to https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-palet-v6ops-point2point-01")).

This is sometimes a good idea, but may fail in some cases as some CPEs or scripts may try to use it for loopback and assign the next /64 to the LAN ports. Responsibility for the prefix is delegated to a CPE, but then one /64 is used for the WAN connection. Whilst there is a DHCPv6 option to let the CPE know if one of its prefixes have been “stolen” (RFC 6603). Even if RFC 7084 asks for it, not all CPEs support this and some issues will be encountered.

This is an option that simplifies routing and general provisioning provided you're sure that the CPEs in your network don't have the aforementioned issues.

#### 4.1.5. Summary

Using a global /64 prefix for the WAN connection is the recommended choice.

Besides being a safe choice, using a /64 is sometimes required when there are more devices than the two endpoints on a WAN link (e.g. intermediary bridges or repeaters) that require management, or if there is the need for redundancy (e.g. VRRPv3 or multiple routers at the customer premises).

When choosing which /64 to use, the recommended option is to dedicate a separate pool of prefixes for the WAN links. While the addressing plan and administration might be easier when selecting the /64 from the prefix delegated to the customer, this is technically “stealing” because the customer's CPE has been informed that whole prefix will be delegated to it, so it should not also be used on the WAN link unless it is known that all CPEs will support RFC 6603 to negotiate this.

When providing address space to a smaller ISP you should give them a sub-allocation (not an assignment) that allows them to make properly sized (see the rest of this BCOP) assignments to their customers.

Using ULA addresses on the WAN link is very strongly discouraged.

### 4.2. Prefix assignment options

To keep addressing plans usable and understandable, and to align with DNS reverse zone delegations, the size of the delegated prefix should align with a nibble boundary. Each hexadecimal character in an IPv6 prefix represents one nibble, which is 4 bits. The length of a delegated prefix should therefore always be a multiple of 4.

A single network at a customer site will be a /64. At present, RIR policies permit assignment of a /48 per site, so the possible options when choosing a prefix size to delegate are /48, /52, /56, /60 and /64. However, /64 is not sustainable, it doesn't allow customer subnetting, and it doesn't follow IETF recommendations of “at least” multiple /64s per customer. Moreover, future work within the IETF and recommendations from [RFC 7934](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7934#section-6 "External link to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7934#section-6") (section 6) allow the assignment of a /64 to a single interface (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-v6ops-unique-ipv6-prefix-per-host-07).

The following sections explain why /48 and /56 are the recommended prefix assignment sizes for end customers.

#### 4.2.1. /48 for everybody

This is probably the most practical way to assign IPv6 prefixes to end customer CPE devices. In this case everyone has a /48 prefix and advanced end-users are less likely to make mistakes when addressing their networks and devices, resulting in much less call-centre time to sort out problems. It also has the advantage of sharing the same prefix size as ULAs and some transition mechanisms, so this facilitates a direct mapping of existing customer addressing plans to the delegated prefix.

Example of assigned prefixes out of 2001:db8::/40 :

2001:db8:aaaa::/48
2001:db8:aaab::/48
2001:db8:aaac::/48
2001:db8:aaad::/48

For the first prefix, **2001:db8:aaaa:XXXX::/48**, the XXXX is the part that the end-user can use to make their own addressing plan. This is also the structure used in most addressing plan manuals and guides.

#### 4.2.2. /48 for business customers and /56 for residential customers

Some operators decide to give a /48 prefix to their business customers and a /56 to their residential customers. This rationale is understood to be mainly coming from sales and marketing departments where they wish to create some distinction in services between different types of customer. This method can be considered as pragmatic, future-proof and has nearly no downsides, the same as the “/48 for everyone” approach.

For more advanced customers who manually configure their servers and routers, local addressing is a bit harder for /56 prefixes, as you are unable to use all 4 digits between the double colons in the address notation. This means that there is a higher risk of making mistakes whilst making the addressing plans and sub-assign addresses to devices outside the assigned prefix. This should not be a problem in simple cases where a CPE assigns all prefixes, but it might cause annoyances for those advanced users that want to offer content and services from their home network.

It should be remembered that some protocols/mechanisms use a default /48 prefix size (tunnel brokers, ULA, 6to4, among others), so if a customer already has an addressing plan, they will be forced to redo it and renumber in case of a different prefix size. Instead, using the same prefix size, allow them to keep the addressing plan and just renumber some of the prefix bits rather than have a complete numbering plan change.

Example of assigned prefixes out of 2001:db8::/40 :

2001:db8:aaaa:1a00::/56
2001:db8:aaaa:1b00::/56
2001:db8:aaaa:1c00::/56
2001:db8:aaaa:1d00::/56

For the first prefix, **2001:db8:aaaa:1aXX::/56**, the XX is the part that advanced customers can use to make their own addressing plan.

An alternative is to reserve a /48 for residential customers, but actually assign them just the first /56. If subsequently required, they can then be upgraded to the required prefix size without the need to renumber, or the spare prefixes can be used for new customers if it is not possible to obtain a new allocation from your RIR (which should not happen according to current IPv6 policies).

Finally, it should also be taken into consideration that SMEs often use residential services, which means that you may be actually assigning /56 to business customers.

#### 4.2.3. Prefixes, longer than /56

It is **strongly discouraged** to assign prefixes longer than /56 unless there are very strong and unsolvable technical reasons for doing this.

There are enough IPv6 addresses to delegate end-users a /48, so a /56 already represents a sizeable restriction. There is no need to delegate fewer addresses than that, so if your IPv6 allocation is insufficient to provide a /56 to each end customer (remember there are 134 million /56s in a /29 and 16,7 million in a /32), explain to your RIR that your initial allocation was too small and that you require a larger allocation based on your IPv6 implementation plan. Offering less than a /56 can be feasible if just a /29 is allocated and 6RD is being used, as an IPv4 address is embedded in the IPv6 prefix. However, even in this case, a larger allocation from your RIR can be justified and the transition protocol allows other ways to sort it out.

Assigning a /64 or longer prefix **does not conform to IPv6 standards and will break functionality in customer LANs**. With a single /64, the end customer CPE will have just one possible network on the LAN side and it will not be possible to subnet, assign VLANs, alternative SSIDs, or have several chained routers in the same customer network, etc.

Some CPEs use a /64 for the loopback interface and some may have multiple LAN segments predefined (for example Guest WiFi network and wired LAN), so as soon as there is more than one LAN segment behind the CPE, exceptions will have to be added to the ISP provisioning system that will greatly complicate management. It is not possible to assign less than a /64 to each LAN port/segment/subnet/VLAN due to IPv6 protocol requirements (SLAAC, ND, etc..) that reserve the last 64 bits of an IPv6 address for the host.

Moreover, there is work in progress at IETF showing that it can be convenient in some cases to assign a /64 to each host (e.g. for security, isolation of customers, or having many virtual machines on a single host), again explaining the need for delegating many /64s to each customer.

A growing number of operators are also using prefix colouring to deploy products with distinct Service Level Agreements (e.g. voice, data, video) and this requires at least a unique /64 for each product or service. If combined with home networking technologies under development, the number of prefixes increases quite quickly and delegation of multiple IPv6 prefixes at the same time will occur, so assignments of less than /56 will probably require renumbering in the near future.

The Broadband Forum also recommends a similar approach in their TR-177 document (2010): [https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-177.pdf](https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-177.pdf "External link to https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-177.pdf")

"*A delegated prefix for use within the home network (mandatory). The Broadband Forum suggests a size for the delegated prefix of at least a /60 for home network or SOHO environments, with a recommended prefix length of /56. The delegated prefix may be extended to a /48 for larger organizations.*"

#### 4.2.4. Considerations for Cellular Operators

There is a clear exception to the rule described above when assigning prefixes in a cellular network. In this case, a /64 will need to be provided for each PDP context for cellular phones, whereas for LTE modems/routers, i.e. in the case of broadband by means of cellular access, it will still be necessary to choose a /48 or /56 in accordance with the aforementioned considerations.

## 5. End-user IPv6 prefix assignment: Persistent vs non-persistent

After determining the size of the IPv6 prefixes to be assigned to end customers, it is necessary to establish how to actually assign them. There are two methods: persistent and non-persistent assignment.

Persistent assignment means that a prefix is assigned to a customer (typically by means of an AAA, which may be dependent on DHCPv6 and/or other provisioning systems) and that prefix will always remain the same regardless of how many times the customer (re)connects or renews the lease. It is “persistent” for the same customer in the same link/location regardless of the provisioning system being used.

DHCPv6-PD is commonly used for non-persistent assignments, where a bigger pool of IPv6 space is assigned to each termination point, and so as customers connect, they are randomly assigned prefixes from this when they (re-)connect or the lease time expires. They may get the same prefix, but typically it will be different (non-persistent) unless the lease time is so high that it effectively become “persistent”. In this case, a customer will get the same prefix even if they switch off their router for several days, weeks or months, depending on the lease time.

### 5.1. Why non-persistent assignments may be perceived as “easier” than static ones

When faced with the task of how to deploy IPv6, it is easy to go for an option that initially requires less effort, time and energy. However, this will usually create more problems later on.

The easiest method is to assign prefixes from a pool of IPv6 prefixes to termination points (BNGs or other equipment, depending on the type of access network) and let the provisioning system decide what customers will get when they connect and ask for a prefix delegation over DHCPv6. This practice is carried over from the IPv4 world where addresses are commonly assigned dynamically and where CPEs perform NAT to conserve IPv4 space. Bear in mind that end customers with an IPv4 subnet behind their CPE never got “non-persistent” assigned IPv4 prefixes as this would require reconfiguration of all hosts on their network every few hours or days. By contrast, every IPv6 customer gets an IPv6 subnet so it is unnecessary to apply this “IPv4 model” to IPv6.

Non-persistent prefix assignment also appears initially easier as it facilitates aggregation of internal routing tables according to end customer connection termination points. Every termination point has its own pool of IPv6 prefixes that are nicely aggregable, whilst with persistent IPv6 prefix assignments it is necessary to discover which customer is terminated at which termination point, group them into larger IPv6 pools, and then update our database accordingly. This is unless your provisioning system is doing it in the other way around from an AAA database and is typically tied to an IPAM for the initial assignment to each new customer.

Some operators may ask what happens if a customer moves to another city or neighbourhood, but if they move to a different location then all the equipment is switched off whilst transporting it. Since it will be necessary to provision the new connection elsewhere, then it is perfectly fine to also change the prefix of the customer to match the criteria for that aggregation point unless is it in the same “aggregation region/point” or the customer specifically requests that the same IPv6 prefix moves with them. In this case, the internal routing table will be one entry bigger and the decision may be to offer that service at an extra cost, but that should be an uncommon scenario.

### 5.2. Why non-persistent assignments are considered harmful

Taking a scenario where there is a connected CPE with a dynamically assigned prefix (e.g. 2001:db8:aaaa::/48). The CPE may sub-assign local loopback addresses out of the first /64 segment (2001:db8:aaaa:0::/64) and sub-assign 2001:db8:aaaa:1::/64 to the first LAN interface (and possibly 2001:db8:aaaa:2::/64 to the guest WiFi interface, and so on).

So, the hosts on the network autoconfigure IPv6 addresses out of 2001:db8:aaaa:1::/64 and/or 2001:db8:aaaa:2::/64 segments and start communicating with the rest of the Internet.

Now all of a sudden there is a power outage (which is very common in many regions/countries in the world, even “highly-developed” countries) or the CPE freezes and reboots and the connection has to be established again, but this time with a new IPv6 assigned prefix of 2001:db8:bbbb::/48. If the CPE knows that the delegated prefix has changed, it should send out RA packets with a prefix valid lifetime of 0 to tell all devices that the old addresses are no longer valid. However, the CPE rarely knows that before the reboot there was a different prefix on the network, and the packets to revoke the old IPv6 addresses do not get sent. In this case, multiple IPv6 addresses from completely different assigned prefixes end up on the same network interface, some of which will no longer work and may imply increase the number of claims to the call-centre.

Different OS vendors treat this scenario differently, but there often ends up being a wrong source IPv6 address for sending packets through the CPE out to the Internet. As the network operator's equipment deleted the previous delegated prefix route back to the CPE, any return packets never reach the originating device and IPv6 connectivity will be broken until the old IPv6 addresses time-out and are automatically removed from the interfaces. If another reconnection to the ISP is required in the interim, there will be a third set of IPv6 addresses from yet another assigned prefix, and this will cause even more confusion.

Some big content providers are measuring “IPv6 brokenness” in operator networks by matching the SYN, SYN ACK and ACK packets received/sent to/from a single source. If they see a SYN and send back SYN ACK, but never receive ACK in a timely manner, they slowly stop serving AAAA records for the AS number where they see this. So, if you decide to assign IPv6 non-persistent prefixes, don't be surprised if content providers start ignoring your IPv6 traffic quite quickly and force your customers back to IPv4. And these are usually destinations (big content providers) where you will be sending a significant amount of traffic.

Using non-persistent prefixes also means that it is necessary to have a logging system that registers which WAN and LAN prefixes are being used at each moment by each customer site in order to comply with legal/regulatory requirements.

Finally, if users have services such as web, email or VPNs, they typically need to manually configure the addresses of those, so using non-persistent prefixes is not an option in this case. With the growth of broadband capacities (such as FTTH), it is becoming more and more common that end-users run servers or services on their LANs, including the likes of IP cameras or security systems in a home. Persistent prefixes will allow DNS names to be assigned to individual addresses of those prefixes.

If you wish to do non-persistent prefix delegation, you must verify that the CPEs used by the majority of your users will not have the problems described above. If this can't be ensured, then the recommendation is to avoid using non-persistent prefixes and revisit the CPE and end user device implementations periodically to see whether this has become feasible if you still need that.

It also needs to be realised that non-persistent prefixes have other implications, because it is not only the CPEs that need to be numbered, but all the devices behind them in the customer LANs as well. Different implementations can have very different behaviors that may affect the number of support calls to your call-centre every time a prefix changes.

### 5.3. Why persistent prefix assignments are recommended

As already mentioned, the best practice in IPv4 was to assign persistent IPv4 prefixes whilst giving an end-user a routed prefix, and same is true for IPv6 where persistent prefix assignment is strongly recommended. If required for provisioning, the connection between a network and a customer CPE can be non-persistent using /64 (or even /127 if the equipment supports it), but choosing persistent IPv6 assigned prefixes for end-user LANs will avoid a lot of difficulties experienced by some earlier IPv6 network operators.

This is especially the case where there are non-residential customers as well, as this means you can have a single provisioning system and it is unnecessary to maintain a logging system. This is because each user/site always have the same prefix(es) and can be identified in the AAA or provisioning system, reducing complexity and making things cheaper. A bit of initial thought, planning and consideration for future needs can therefore save a great deal of time and energy when IPv6 has been deployed.

From the economic/business perspective, another important consideration with persistent prefixes is that it is possible to ‘name' value added services using DNS (e.g. camera1.username.ispname.com) that can result in considerable new income streams. Trying to deploy new services or applications with non-persistent prefixes is always more difficult and costly, and will increase time spent on troubleshooting. This is just one example to make clear that persistent prefixes enable innovation, new services and applications, which in turn means new business possibilities.

Further to the above, it should be noted that persistent assignments of prefixes to customers may increase the incentive for customers to remain with that ISP, and result in decreased customer churn.

Finally, if you're unconvinced about the use of persistent prefixes, you should at least consider using non-persistent but long-lived assignments so the lease time is as long as your provisioning system allows.

"So if you are in the market for a very compact chassis to house your Mini ITX or DTX motherboard that has flexibility, features and great looks then yeah, the Fractal Design Node 304 should be very high on your shopping list. It is compact, looks great and would make for an excellent file-server thanks to the large amount of HDD space. Pop in a AMD APU based motherboard like we did and boom, you just created yourself a fine Home Theater PC."

"The build quality is solid and the case is nicely ventilated, plus with the ability for this to be used as a smart looking HTPC and/or a nas unit makes it stand out from the crowd and not only justify its price but also the OC3D Gold award."

J'ai la chance d'avoir deux providers (des gros pas des alternatifs) et pourtant aucun acces IPv6 (Red FTTLA et Bouygues FTTH)

Autre point que ce soit bien ou pas beaucoup se sentent proteges par le NAT et il me semble qu'il n'y a pas une vision acceptée de ce que doit fournir un FAI comme protection en IPv6

Tout à fait.

- Vision Free : tous les périphériques IPv6 sont accessibles directement depuis Internet, vu qu'il n'y a pas de NAT.

- Vision Orange / Orne THD : Pour offrir la même sécurité que le NAT, par défaut tous les ports entrants sont bloqués en IPv6, il faut donc ouvrir un par un les port souhaités, comme si on était derrière e un NAT, sur le firewall de la box.

- Vision Bouygues (sur le mobile comme sur la Bbox) : Tous les ports entrants sont bloqués en IPv6 et il n'est pas possible d'autoriser les flux entrants.

Qui a raison ?

Ma vision :
On doit protéger par défaut ET permettre l'ouverture des ports donc plutot version orange

La protection me semble necessaire car 90% des gens ne savent pas se proteger eux meme et n'avaient quasi pas a le faire en IPv4 il est donc de leur interet et de celui des hotlines d'avoir un firewall.
Il doit neanmoins etre possible de faire ce que l'on veut a l'aide d'option (gratuites)

A titre perso, je choisis la proposition Free : C'est au périphérique de se sécuriser.
Et avec les Privacy Extensions, la surface d'attaque est tellement énorme que je ne suis pas spécialement inquiet.

Après, un firewall qui bloque tout par défaut, pourquoi pas, juste pas celui d'Orange.

en fait je comprend meme pas comment on peut accepter le FAI se permette de bloquer par defaut des paquets qui te sont destinés....

Très bonne idée...

Mais pourquoi cette fonction n'est toujours pas présente alors qu'elle a été demandée en 2011 ? ( <https://dev.freebox.fr/bugs/task/4110> )

mouais je vois.

m'enfin c'est quand meme pitoyable. En gros c'est comme si pour traverser la rue y a un flic qui doit te tenir la main et sans lui ben tu peux pas traverser. Tout ca parce que que globalement y a trop de cons qui se pourraient se faire ecraser...

# pfsense-still-closedsource

The only purpose of this repository is to document the false advertising of the so-called "open-source" pfSense®™ project. Brought to you courtesy of Netgate/Rubicon Communications LLC/ Electric Sheep Fencing LLC.

In case someone naively thinks that <https://github.com/pfsense/FreeBSD-src> contains the pfSense®™ source code - that is not the case. You cannot build pfSense®™ 2.4.x from source code. No, not even with the [official tools](https://github.com/pfsense/pfsense/tree/master/tools) - those will just sabotage you. The repository claimed to be "FreeBSD src with pfSense changes" does not contain the source code of the kernel shipped with pfSense®™ 2.4.x, and other changes done to FreeBSD code are also being selectively ommited from that repository.

Of course, such details cannot stop Netgate from plastering their websites and every single piece of their marketing material with "open source":

---

Open-source labeling of course helps even when you are in business of [selling overpriced networking gear](https://store.netgate.com/):

---

Not providing the source code for the actual product naturally cannot stop Netgate from falsely advertising that ["those who wish to review the source code in full detail, the changes are all publicly available on GitHub"](https://www.netgate.com/blog/pfsense-2-4-1-release-now-available.html) in their release notes either:

---

[![BS release notes](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/raw/master/img/screenshot_relnotes_241.png)](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/blob/master/img/screenshot_relnotes_241.png)

---

**No, you cannot review the source code in full**. But of course when you put enough open-source claims on your website, [there is no need to provide the source code](https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=138822.msg759561#msg759561), so do not bother with requesting it.

If you don't follow the above advice, Netgate's CEO will eventually [accuse you](https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=137636.msg754001#msg754001) of being [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/)/[Franco's](https://github.com/fichtner) agent. Even [if you have nothing in common](https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=138822.msg758739#msg758739) with [OPNsense project](https://github.com/opnsense) in fact contributed thousands of commits to pfSense®™, even if you are not competing with pfSense®™/Netgate at all, even if you are not in business of selling routers/firewalls, you still are the prime suspect, being accused of trying to [gain advantage](https://forum.pfsense.org/index.php?topic=138804.msg759343#msg759343). **Paranoia is a serious mental disorder.**

If you think it's not a big deal, think again. Here, we have an unlucky user experiencing a bug that's basically a showstopper for his chosen workflow:

---

[![Hey mighty gurus, I beg you for private kernel source code copy...](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/raw/master/img/secret_pfsense_bugs_user_begging_for_private_kernel.png)](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/blob/master/img/secret_pfsense_bugs_user_begging_for_private_kernel.png)

---

Notice how this allegedly open-source solution is in fact no better than any of the tons of proprietary alternatives out there. You cannot fix the bug yourself, you cannot have it fixed by someone you hire either, you cannot update, you are stuck. The (still) open configuration web GUI and the backend code mean nothing. It all falls apart and gets useless without access to the sources of the underlying customized FreeBSD operating system. It just won't work. Useless.

Is this a fair competition? No, of course not. Netgate are gaining an illegitimate advantage from the deceptive open-source advertising. Are these lies harming users as well? Apparently, as you can see above. The truth is so uncomfortable that it needs to be hidden by all means. The access to the above ticket [has been promptly locked](https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/8025) - and is still locked at the time of writing this (Nov. 26, 2017). The forum thread linked there vanished as well. Why? Simply because it reveals the sad truth. *The Emperor Wears No Clothes.* Users begging for access to the kernel sources of a project that keeps babbling about open-source just about everywhere - cannot get much more absurd really.

And here's another example - [Bug #8155](https://redmine.pfsense.org/issues/8155) ("shockingly", the access got locked within minutes after making the screenshot).

Certainly NOT with pfSense closed source...](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/raw/master/img/screenshot_bug8155_rebuilding_pfsense_kernel.png)](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/blob/master/img/screenshot_bug8155_rebuilding_pfsense_kernel.png)

---

Sorry, Sir, you have been lied to and mislead by Netgate. And, as predicted, they *will* hide the bug from public view when their lies get inconveniently exposed.

While Mr. Thompson is soooo full of his pfSense®™ intellectual property and trademarks that he does not hesitate to claim any usage of "pf" or "sense" in combination with whatever else to be infringing - see [Can I sell pfSense](https://doc.pfsense.org/index.php/Can_I_sell_pfSense) [(PDF)](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/blob/master/docs/Can%20I%20sell%20pfSense%20-%20PFSenseDocs.pdf) - or trying to teach people how to use English - see [pfSense Trademark Usage Guidelines](https://www.pfsense.org/trademarks.html) [(PDF)](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/blob/master/docs/pfSense%20Trademark%20Usage%20Guidelines.pdf) - this is his take on other people's IP:

---

Shockingly, LEGO decided to [sue gonzo's ass](https://dockets.justia.com/docket/connecticut/ctdce/3%3A2015cv00823/108470) (also see [PDF1](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/blob/master/docs/Lego%20vs.%20Rubicon%20Communications%20-%2001.pdf), [PDF2](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/blob/master/docs/Lego%20vs.%20Rubicon%20Communications%20-%2002.pdf)). Ooops...

Infringing on other companies' trademarks apparently was not an isolated incident for Netgate. In another stunt, they've [registered opnsense.com domain](https://github.com/doktornotor/pfsense-still-closedsource/blob/master/opnsense/README.md) and created a website there to discredit the [OPNsense](https://opnsense.org/) competition. Getting caught, they tried parody as defence. Shockingly, WIPO [did not buy into that nonsense](http://www.wipo.int/amc/en/domains/search/text.jsp?case=D2017-1828).

### The older I get, the less patience for bullshit I have. Dear [@Jim Thompson](https://twitter.com/gonzopancho):

I have closed all my remaining [pull](https://github.com/pfsense/FreeBSD-ports/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20author%3Adoktornotor%20) [requests](https://github.com/pfsense/pfsense/pulls?utf8=%E2%9C%93&q=is%3Apr%20is%3Aclosed%20author%3Adoktornotor%20) - definitely to gain the advantage of no longer contributing to a project that keeps lying to its users and customers. Oh, and thanks for locking my [issue tracker](https://redmine.pfsense.org/projects/pfsense/) account. I only reported couple hundreds of issues, many of them with PRs to fix the bugs. Not a big deal either.

P.S. A final advise, Jim. Reading [the FTC's advertising guideliness](https://www.ftc.gov/tips-advice/business-center/guidance/advertising-faqs-guide-small-business) and actually following them might spare you quite a bit of trouble in future. [False/misleading advertising is illegal.](https://www.ftc.gov/news-events/media-resources/truth-advertising)

In case people still decide to buy products from Netgate - kindly do yourself a favor and download the factory firmware image within the first year and keep it somewhere safe. If you need to reinstall the firmware, their "unencumbered by traditional annual contracts" claims won't exactly help you with that task:

## [Terramaster NAS exposing itself with UPNP](/terramaster-nas-exposing-itself-over-upnp/)

3 April, 2021

[Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=26681984)
|
[Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DataHoarder/comments/mk3l0i/terramaster_nas_exposing_itself_with_upnp_over/)
> Addendum: The most controversial detail in this blog post so far has been my claim that disabling uPnP is a significant hit to convenience. I wanted to be fully transparent and say that I do not have data to back this claim up, and this is more of a feeling than it is an analytical decision. This criticism somewhat misses the point however, since the vast majority of consumer routes I’ve encountered personally have uPnP enabled by default, and the consumers purchasing this NAS might have no idea what uPnP is or how to disable it. I plan a blog post in future where I will disable uPnP without making any other changes, to see if anything breaks at all, because it is completely possible my opinion on this is wrong.
>
> I have released another blog post related to this one, which provides more detail: [Ok, Ok, I’m Turning uPnP off.](/turning-upnp-off/)
>
> Terramaster appear to have released a fix for this, although I have not tested it yet. [Read more](https://forum.terra-master.com/en/viewtopic.php?f=28&t=1813&sid=253a445ed3e80962022508229df8b37a)

I recently bought a Terramaster F2-210. It’s a reasonably nice NAS that does what I ask of it. I however discovered something which unsettled me. As I’ve discussed in previous articles [uPnP is a convenience that can be particularly dangerous](/exploiting-upnp-literally-childsplay/). These NAS products are generally administrated using a web interface and The Terramaster TOS software is no different. The software requests you visit the hostname of the device on your network port 8181 in order to access the NAS interface, and the interface openly claims the NAS is not publicly accessible.

![A screenshot from within the NAS user interface that reads 'Notes: Enter the following address in your browser to access TOS; Tt is only available only on the local network. http://horse.local Or http://192.168.0.198'](/posts/tnas-upnp/terramaster-upnp-0.png)

A few days after installing the NAS, I discovered I could access the NAS using my public IP, even though I hadn’t port forwarded anything! Upon inspecting my routers port forwarding rules, I identified that the NAS was punching 4 ports using uPnP. It was punching 8181 as we just discovered, but also 5443 which is for SSL access should you have configured it, and inexplicably port 9091, which normally is for Portainer, a container management tool for Docker, as well as 8800 - I’m not sure what this port is. It seems that potentially some of these rules were left in from the development process. I trust this NAS to be reliable hardware, however I am dubious of trusting its web interface to the open internet. Generally good practice to expose as little as possible to the public internet anyway!

![A screenshot from a router admin interface that shows 4 port forwarding rules, forwarding traffic on ports 5443, 8181, 9091, and 8800 to the NAS](/posts/tnas-upnp/terramaster-upnp-1.png)

Unfortunately, disabling uPnP these days is too much of a hit to convenience, so I looked for other solutions. My router is an ISP provisioned one so the feature-set there is somewhat limited, so I wanted to prevent the NAS from opening these ports rather than firewalling them off at the router.

I dug through the NAS interface and was not able to discover a way to disable this behaviour, since I didn’t really want my NAS administration interface publicly accessible. What I did discover was that the default web server port was at least configurable, so I changed it, and checked the uPnP port mappings again. Somewhat surprisingly, it punched holes for these new ports, but didn’t clear the existing ports! The NAS uPnP rules it punches are 5443, 8181, 9091, 8800, 54633, and 54632".

This annoyed me, so I contacted Terramaster about this 6 weeks ago, hoping they’d have a suggestion or something as a fix, but this wasn’t supplied, and therefore I went digging myself.

Upon SSHing into the NAS and having a dig around the file system, I discovered a file that could be modified. /etc/upnp.json seems to contain a list of port forwarding rules. Thank you to Terramaster for providing root access to these at least. Simply change `bEnable` to 0 for whatever ports you don’t want exposed, reboot the NAS, and check the port forwarding rules.

           "sProtocol": "TCP",
           "bEnable": 0
       }
   ]
```

This almost completely resolves the problem, however it seems the ports 8181 and 5443 remain punched, but result in a 404, since we moved the web server earlier. This is better than before, but still not perfect. I await further instructions from Terramaster/a software update, and will update this blog post should I get this.

## 1. Executive summary

This document discusses the main issues related to the operational practices for the assignment of IPv6 prefixes for end-users.

Making wrong choices when designing your IPv6 network will sooner or later have negative implications for deployment and require further effort such as renumbering when the network is already in operation. The temptation to take “easy” approaches for quicker deployment should therefore be resisted.

As a generic set of recommendations, you should consider the following:

1. **IPv6 is not the same as IPv4**. In IPv6 you assign a short prefix to each end-user site, so they are able to have as many subnets (/64s) as they need. You should not be concerned with exhausting the IPv6 addressing space, and you should think big when planning future requirements. If you need more space, you can go back to your RIR and, providing your addressing plan justifies it, you can obtain more IPv6 addresses.
2. Assigning prefixes longer than /56 is **strongly discouraged**, so your choices are:
   1. If you want a simple addressing plan use a /48 for each end-user. This will work very well for customers coming from other ISPs, those that have their own ULA, or have been using transition mechanisms. This will also be easier when you have a mix of customers using the same infrastructure, whether they are residential customers, SMEs or even large corporates.
   2. Differentiate amongst types of customers, even if this will increase the complexity of your network and those of your customers, by offering /48 for business customers and /56 for residential customers.
   3. A trade-off amongst the previous two options by reserving a /48 for residential customers, but actually just assigning them the first /56.

      There is a specific case for cellular phones to be assigned a single /64 per each PDP context, but this is out of the scope of this document.
3. In order to facilitate troubleshooting and have a future proof network, you should consider **numbering the WAN links using GUAs**, using a /64 prefix out of a dedicated pool of IPv6 prefixes. If you decide to use /127 for each point-to-point link, it is advisable to allocate a /64 for each link and just use one /127 out of it.
4. Non-persistent prefixes are considered harmful in IPv6 as you can't avoid issues that may be caused by simple end-user power outages, so assigning **persistent prefixes is a safer and simpler approach**. Furthermore, this avoids the need for expensive logging, increases your chances to offer new business to customers, and decreases your customer churn.
5. In countries with **specific legal environments**, ISPs are encouraged to support both stable (persistent) and privacy-oriented (non-persistent) prefixes as options for customers. Persistent prefixes are recommended as the default, in the absence of legal requirements to the contrary.

This approach is probably suited for most operator cases. However, we strongly encourage you to read through the rest of this document in order to understand the reasons for these recommendations. This will help you draw your own conclusions, and ensure that your solution matches your specific requirements.

## 2. What is a BCOP?

A Best Current Operational Practices (BCOP) document describes best current operational practice on a particular topic, as agreed by subject matter experts, and is periodically reviewed by the Internet community. This document is not intended to describe what practices may emerge in the future, but to reflect the best methods of implementing IPv6 at the time of publication.

## 3. Introduction and incentives

The target audience of this document are ISPs (technical staff, network architects and other similar departments) who provide or intend to provide IPv6 services to end-users, whether residential or business.

The task of any ISP is to provide its customers with Internet connectivity, which includes providing those customers with IP addresses. Customers generally receive a single IPv4 address, but with IPv6 a customer requires a block of addresses, also known as a prefix. This document provides guidance as to what size such prefixes should be.

Network operators may encounter unexpected or unwanted results if they make wrong decisions when choosing the size of a prefix assignment or the method of assigning it. These negative results may come into effect immediately, e.g. if networks or content providers are measuring the IPv6 “brokenness” and may thus stop serving you AAAA records, or in the future, e.g. when the HOMENET standard results in more complex home networks being built and operated. In these cases, network operators will have to adapt their IPv6 implementations to new requirements, possibly including complete network renumbering, whilst their IPv6 network is already in production and has connected customers.

Up until now, there have been no clear recommendations as to what size of prefixes to choose and assign to customers, hence the decision to document some best current operational practices for network operators to consider when making their decisions.

## 4. Size of end-user prefix assignment: /48, /56 or something else?

Network operators deploying IPv6 will sooner or later need to decide which size of IPv6 prefixes they will assign to their end-users. At this point, numbering decisions that were based on IPv4 scarcity need to be reconsidered because the abundance of IPv6 addresses enables numbering decisions to be taken differently.

Many operators might perceive the assignment of large IPv6 prefixes to end customers as wasteful, but the reality is that decisions should be based on the IPv6 protocol architecture design. For example, Tony Hain calculated that assigning a /48 to every human on Earth, and never recovering those, will still mean that IPv6 would have a lifetime over the 480 years and we could repeat that several times. On that timescale, there will be other reasons, not just scarcity of IPv6 addresses, that will require the IETF to design a successor to IPv6.

### 4.1. Numbering the WAN link (interconnection between the network and the end-user CPE)

Before going into details about the size of IPv6 prefix assignments, the choice for the WAN link needs to be understood. There are three options for addresses on the link between the operator network and the “end-user” CPE WAN port. Note that CE is also commonly used for the CPE (RFC 7084).

#### 4.1.1. /64 prefix from a dedicated pool of IPv6 prefixes

Using a /64 prefix from a dedicated pool of IPv6 prefixes is the most common scenario and currently the best practice. A separate block of IPv6 space is allocated for the WAN links to the end customer CPEs, so that when CPE connects to the network and performs router discovery, a /64 prefix is used to number both ends of the connection.

In the case of an end-user host (not router) connecting over PPPoE (for example), the setup process is concluded when the host is properly IPv6 numbered and can start sending and receiving traffic.

In the case of a router connecting to a network that is capable of issuing a DHCPv6-PD request, the IPv6 prefix delegation process is started and an IPv6 prefix is assigned to the CPE. This method is most probably the safer one, covering most of the scenarios regardless of underlying technologies, and is the one most used by operators.

Some operators also use /126, /127, /112 or an alternative prefix assignment instead of /64 for managed links where addresses on the link are manually configured, and according to RFC 6164, a /127 is suggested to prevent, among others, the [Neighbor Discovery exhaustion attack](https://insinuator.net/2013/03/ipv6-neighbor-cache-exhaustion-attacks-risk-assessment-mitigation-strategies-part-1/ "External link to https://insinuator.net/2013/03/ipv6-neighbor-cache-exhaustion-attacks-risk-assessment-mitigation-strategies-part-1/") (RFC 6583). Please note, that not all equipment currently supports this option, so /64 is still the safest approach and has the advantage of being future proof in the event that new standards make usage of the other 64 bits for other purposes or the link becomes point-to-multipoint, etc. Furthermore, some ISP hardware has limitations in using prefixes longer than /64, so the use of non-/64 prefixes will use more resources on these devices. If we decide to use /127 for each point to point link, then it is also advisable to allocate a /64 for each link and use just one /127 out of it.

Finally, one additional benefit for a dedicated pool, is the possibility to apply security policies without harming the customers. This is only true if customers **always** have a CPE at their end of the WAN link.

#### 4.1.2. Unnumbered

Some operators decide to leave the WAN link to the end-user CPE unnumbered which means no GUA, so only link-local addresses are used at both ends of the link. While this might work for routers, it does not work for devices that cannot request a prefix delegation over DHCPv6 and are therefore left without any usable GUA to allow traffic in and out. In the case of a router on the end customer side, the route for the assigned prefix is pointed towards the link-local address on the CPE/router WAN port and the default route on the CPE/router is pointed towards the link-local address on the upstream network equipment port. This method may be seen as easier to implement, but it also brings some drawbacks such as difficulties with troubleshooting and monitoring that need to be considered. For example, link local addresses do not appear in traceroute, the most common troubleshooting tool used, so you will not be able to easily locate the exact point of failure.

It is most useful in scenarios where it is known that only CPEs will be attached to the WAN link, and where a “pingable” address of the CPE is known (e.g. because the ISP-provided CPEs are always “pingable” on the first delegated address). It is less suitable in situations where unknown CPEs and/or non-CPE devices are attached to the WAN link.

In addition, non-routers (e.g. an older Windows or Linux PC or any other end-user host) connecting to a network that have no ability to ask for prefix delegation over DHCPv6 might experience problems and will stay unnumbered upon connection if a /64 prefix is not used to number the CPE WAN link. This may be also the case for many CPEs, which will not be able to complete the DHCPv6-PD if they got an unnumbered link.

Finally, certain hardware in the ISP infrastructure may consume resources when using numbered links. This is a very specific situation that you may need to consider.

#### 4.1.3. ULA

Some operators use ULAs for numbering the WAN link to the end-user CPE. This approach may cause numerous problems and is therefore **strongly discouraged**. For example, if the CPE needs to send an ICMPv6 message to a host outside an operator's network (to the Internet), the packet with ULA source address will not get very far and PMTUD will break, which in turn will completely break that IPv6 connection when MTU is not the same for all the path.

#### 4.1.4. /64 prefix out of the IPv6 prefix assigned to the end-user

Some operators use the first or last /64 prefix to number the CPE WAN link, from the larger IPv6 prefix assigned to the end customer. This has been described by an expired IETF Internet Draft ([https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-palet-v6ops-point2point-01](https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-palet-v6ops-point2point-01 "External link to https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-palet-v6ops-point2point-01")).

This is sometimes a good idea, but may fail in some cases as some CPEs or scripts may try to use it for loopback and assign the next /64 to the LAN ports. Responsibility for the prefix is delegated to a CPE, but then one /64 is used for the WAN connection. Whilst there is a DHCPv6 option to let the CPE know if one of its prefixes have been “stolen” (RFC 6603). Even if RFC 7084 asks for it, not all CPEs support this and some issues will be encountered.

This is an option that simplifies routing and general provisioning provided you're sure that the CPEs in your network don't have the aforementioned issues.

#### 4.1.5. Summary

Using a global /64 prefix for the WAN connection is the recommended choice.

Besides being a safe choice, using a /64 is sometimes required when there are more devices than the two endpoints on a WAN link (e.g. intermediary bridges or repeaters) that require management, or if there is the need for redundancy (e.g. VRRPv3 or multiple routers at the customer premises).

When choosing which /64 to use, the recommended option is to dedicate a separate pool of prefixes for the WAN links. While the addressing plan and administration might be easier when selecting the /64 from the prefix delegated to the customer, this is technically “stealing” because the customer's CPE has been informed that whole prefix will be delegated to it, so it should not also be used on the WAN link unless it is known that all CPEs will support RFC 6603 to negotiate this.

When providing address space to a smaller ISP you should give them a sub-allocation (not an assignment) that allows them to make properly sized (see the rest of this BCOP) assignments to their customers.

Using ULA addresses on the WAN link is very strongly discouraged.

### 4.2. Prefix assignment options

To keep addressing plans usable and understandable, and to align with DNS reverse zone delegations, the size of the delegated prefix should align with a nibble boundary. Each hexadecimal character in an IPv6 prefix represents one nibble, which is 4 bits. The length of a delegated prefix should therefore always be a multiple of 4.

A single network at a customer site will be a /64. At present, RIR policies permit assignment of a /48 per site, so the possible options when choosing a prefix size to delegate are /48, /52, /56, /60 and /64. However, /64 is not sustainable, it doesn't allow customer subnetting, and it doesn't follow IETF recommendations of “at least” multiple /64s per customer. Moreover, future work within the IETF and recommendations from [RFC 7934](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7934#section-6 "External link to https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7934#section-6") (section 6) allow the assignment of a /64 to a single interface (https://tools.ietf.org/html/draft-ietf-v6ops-unique-ipv6-prefix-per-host-07).

The following sections explain why /48 and /56 are the recommended prefix assignment sizes for end customers.

#### 4.2.1. /48 for everybody

This is probably the most practical way to assign IPv6 prefixes to end customer CPE devices. In this case everyone has a /48 prefix and advanced end-users are less likely to make mistakes when addressing their networks and devices, resulting in much less call-centre time to sort out problems. It also has the advantage of sharing the same prefix size as ULAs and some transition mechanisms, so this facilitates a direct mapping of existing customer addressing plans to the delegated prefix.

Example of assigned prefixes out of 2001:db8::/40 :

2001:db8:aaaa::/48
2001:db8:aaab::/48
2001:db8:aaac::/48
2001:db8:aaad::/48

For the first prefix, **2001:db8:aaaa:XXXX::/48**, the XXXX is the part that the end-user can use to make their own addressing plan. This is also the structure used in most addressing plan manuals and guides.

#### 4.2.2. /48 for business customers and /56 for residential customers

Some operators decide to give a /48 prefix to their business customers and a /56 to their residential customers. This rationale is understood to be mainly coming from sales and marketing departments where they wish to create some distinction in services between different types of customer. This method can be considered as pragmatic, future-proof and has nearly no downsides, the same as the “/48 for everyone” approach.

For more advanced customers who manually configure their servers and routers, local addressing is a bit harder for /56 prefixes, as you are unable to use all 4 digits between the double colons in the address notation. This means that there is a higher risk of making mistakes whilst making the addressing plans and sub-assign addresses to devices outside the assigned prefix. This should not be a problem in simple cases where a CPE assigns all prefixes, but it might cause annoyances for those advanced users that want to offer content and services from their home network.

It should be remembered that some protocols/mechanisms use a default /48 prefix size (tunnel brokers, ULA, 6to4, among others), so if a customer already has an addressing plan, they will be forced to redo it and renumber in case of a different prefix size. Instead, using the same prefix size, allow them to keep the addressing plan and just renumber some of the prefix bits rather than have a complete numbering plan change.

Example of assigned prefixes out of 2001:db8::/40 :

2001:db8:aaaa:1a00::/56
2001:db8:aaaa:1b00::/56
2001:db8:aaaa:1c00::/56
2001:db8:aaaa:1d00::/56

For the first prefix, **2001:db8:aaaa:1aXX::/56**, the XX is the part that advanced customers can use to make their own addressing plan.

An alternative is to reserve a /48 for residential customers, but actually assign them just the first /56. If subsequently required, they can then be upgraded to the required prefix size without the need to renumber, or the spare prefixes can be used for new customers if it is not possible to obtain a new allocation from your RIR (which should not happen according to current IPv6 policies).

Finally, it should also be taken into consideration that SMEs often use residential services, which means that you may be actually assigning /56 to business customers.

#### 4.2.3. Prefixes, longer than /56

It is **strongly discouraged** to assign prefixes longer than /56 unless there are very strong and unsolvable technical reasons for doing this.

There are enough IPv6 addresses to delegate end-users a /48, so a /56 already represents a sizeable restriction. There is no need to delegate fewer addresses than that, so if your IPv6 allocation is insufficient to provide a /56 to each end customer (remember there are 134 million /56s in a /29 and 16,7 million in a /32), explain to your RIR that your initial allocation was too small and that you require a larger allocation based on your IPv6 implementation plan. Offering less than a /56 can be feasible if just a /29 is allocated and 6RD is being used, as an IPv4 address is embedded in the IPv6 prefix. However, even in this case, a larger allocation from your RIR can be justified and the transition protocol allows other ways to sort it out.

Assigning a /64 or longer prefix **does not conform to IPv6 standards and will break functionality in customer LANs**. With a single /64, the end customer CPE will have just one possible network on the LAN side and it will not be possible to subnet, assign VLANs, alternative SSIDs, or have several chained routers in the same customer network, etc.

Some CPEs use a /64 for the loopback interface and some may have multiple LAN segments predefined (for example Guest WiFi network and wired LAN), so as soon as there is more than one LAN segment behind the CPE, exceptions will have to be added to the ISP provisioning system that will greatly complicate management. It is not possible to assign less than a /64 to each LAN port/segment/subnet/VLAN due to IPv6 protocol requirements (SLAAC, ND, etc..) that reserve the last 64 bits of an IPv6 address for the host.

Moreover, there is work in progress at IETF showing that it can be convenient in some cases to assign a /64 to each host (e.g. for security, isolation of customers, or having many virtual machines on a single host), again explaining the need for delegating many /64s to each customer.

A growing number of operators are also using prefix colouring to deploy products with distinct Service Level Agreements (e.g. voice, data, video) and this requires at least a unique /64 for each product or service. If combined with home networking technologies under development, the number of prefixes increases quite quickly and delegation of multiple IPv6 prefixes at the same time will occur, so assignments of less than /56 will probably require renumbering in the near future.

The Broadband Forum also recommends a similar approach in their TR-177 document (2010): [https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-177.pdf](https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-177.pdf "External link to https://www.broadband-forum.org/technical/download/TR-177.pdf")

"*A delegated prefix for use within the home network (mandatory). The Broadband Forum suggests a size for the delegated prefix of at least a /60 for home network or SOHO environments, with a recommended prefix length of /56. The delegated prefix may be extended to a /48 for larger organizations.*"

#### 4.2.4. Considerations for Cellular Operators

There is a clear exception to the rule described above when assigning prefixes in a cellular network. In this case, a /64 will need to be provided for each PDP context for cellular phones, whereas for LTE modems/routers, i.e. in the case of broadband by means of cellular access, it will still be necessary to choose a /48 or /56 in accordance with the aforementioned considerations.

## 5. End-user IPv6 prefix assignment: Persistent vs non-persistent

After determining the size of the IPv6 prefixes to be assigned to end customers, it is necessary to establish how to actually assign them. There are two methods: persistent and non-persistent assignment.

Persistent assignment means that a prefix is assigned to a customer (typically by means of an AAA, which may be dependent on DHCPv6 and/or other provisioning systems) and that prefix will always remain the same regardless of how many times the customer (re)connects or renews the lease. It is “persistent” for the same customer in the same link/location regardless of the provisioning system being used.

DHCPv6-PD is commonly used for non-persistent assignments, where a bigger pool of IPv6 space is assigned to each termination point, and so as customers connect, they are randomly assigned prefixes from this when they (re-)connect or the lease time expires. They may get the same prefix, but typically it will be different (non-persistent) unless the lease time is so high that it effectively become “persistent”. In this case, a customer will get the same prefix even if they switch off their router for several days, weeks or months, depending on the lease time.

### 5.1. Why non-persistent assignments may be perceived as “easier” than static ones

When faced with the task of how to deploy IPv6, it is easy to go for an option that initially requires less effort, time and energy. However, this will usually create more problems later on.

The easiest method is to assign prefixes from a pool of IPv6 prefixes to termination points (BNGs or other equipment, depending on the type of access network) and let the provisioning system decide what customers will get when they connect and ask for a prefix delegation over DHCPv6. This practice is carried over from the IPv4 world where addresses are commonly assigned dynamically and where CPEs perform NAT to conserve IPv4 space. Bear in mind that end customers with an IPv4 subnet behind their CPE never got “non-persistent” assigned IPv4 prefixes as this would require reconfiguration of all hosts on their network every few hours or days. By contrast, every IPv6 customer gets an IPv6 subnet so it is unnecessary to apply this “IPv4 model” to IPv6.

Non-persistent prefix assignment also appears initially easier as it facilitates aggregation of internal routing tables according to end customer connection termination points. Every termination point has its own pool of IPv6 prefixes that are nicely aggregable, whilst with persistent IPv6 prefix assignments it is necessary to discover which customer is terminated at which termination point, group them into larger IPv6 pools, and then update our database accordingly. This is unless your provisioning system is doing it in the other way around from an AAA database and is typically tied to an IPAM for the initial assignment to each new customer.

Some operators may ask what happens if a customer moves to another city or neighbourhood, but if they move to a different location then all the equipment is switched off whilst transporting it. Since it will be necessary to provision the new connection elsewhere, then it is perfectly fine to also change the prefix of the customer to match the criteria for that aggregation point unless is it in the same “aggregation region/point” or the customer specifically requests that the same IPv6 prefix moves with them. In this case, the internal routing table will be one entry bigger and the decision may be to offer that service at an extra cost, but that should be an uncommon scenario.

### 5.2. Why non-persistent assignments are considered harmful

Taking a scenario where there is a connected CPE with a dynamically assigned prefix (e.g. 2001:db8:aaaa::/48). The CPE may sub-assign local loopback addresses out of the first /64 segment (2001:db8:aaaa:0::/64) and sub-assign 2001:db8:aaaa:1::/64 to the first LAN interface (and possibly 2001:db8:aaaa:2::/64 to the guest WiFi interface, and so on).

So, the hosts on the network autoconfigure IPv6 addresses out of 2001:db8:aaaa:1::/64 and/or 2001:db8:aaaa:2::/64 segments and start communicating with the rest of the Internet.

Now all of a sudden there is a power outage (which is very common in many regions/countries in the world, even “highly-developed” countries) or the CPE freezes and reboots and the connection has to be established again, but this time with a new IPv6 assigned prefix of 2001:db8:bbbb::/48. If the CPE knows that the delegated prefix has changed, it should send out RA packets with a prefix valid lifetime of 0 to tell all devices that the old addresses are no longer valid. However, the CPE rarely knows that before the reboot there was a different prefix on the network, and the packets to revoke the old IPv6 addresses do not get sent. In this case, multiple IPv6 addresses from completely different assigned prefixes end up on the same network interface, some of which will no longer work and may imply increase the number of claims to the call-centre.

Different OS vendors treat this scenario differently, but there often ends up being a wrong source IPv6 address for sending packets through the CPE out to the Internet. As the network operator's equipment deleted the previous delegated prefix route back to the CPE, any return packets never reach the originating device and IPv6 connectivity will be broken until the old IPv6 addresses time-out and are automatically removed from the interfaces. If another reconnection to the ISP is required in the interim, there will be a third set of IPv6 addresses from yet another assigned prefix, and this will cause even more confusion.

Some big content providers are measuring “IPv6 brokenness” in operator networks by matching the SYN, SYN ACK and ACK packets received/sent to/from a single source. If they see a SYN and send back SYN ACK, but never receive ACK in a timely manner, they slowly stop serving AAAA records for the AS number where they see this. So, if you decide to assign IPv6 non-persistent prefixes, don't be surprised if content providers start ignoring your IPv6 traffic quite quickly and force your customers back to IPv4. And these are usually destinations (big content providers) where you will be sending a significant amount of traffic.

Using non-persistent prefixes also means that it is necessary to have a logging system that registers which WAN and LAN prefixes are being used at each moment by each customer site in order to comply with legal/regulatory requirements.

Finally, if users have services such as web, email or VPNs, they typically need to manually configure the addresses of those, so using non-persistent prefixes is not an option in this case. With the growth of broadband capacities (such as FTTH), it is becoming more and more common that end-users run servers or services on their LANs, including the likes of IP cameras or security systems in a home. Persistent prefixes will allow DNS names to be assigned to individual addresses of those prefixes.

If you wish to do non-persistent prefix delegation, you must verify that the CPEs used by the majority of your users will not have the problems described above. If this can't be ensured, then the recommendation is to avoid using non-persistent prefixes and revisit the CPE and end user device implementations periodically to see whether this has become feasible if you still need that.

It also needs to be realised that non-persistent prefixes have other implications, because it is not only the CPEs that need to be numbered, but all the devices behind them in the customer LANs as well. Different implementations can have very different behaviors that may affect the number of support calls to your call-centre every time a prefix changes.

### 5.3. Why persistent prefix assignments are recommended

As already mentioned, the best practice in IPv4 was to assign persistent IPv4 prefixes whilst giving an end-user a routed prefix, and same is true for IPv6 where persistent prefix assignment is strongly recommended. If required for provisioning, the connection between a network and a customer CPE can be non-persistent using /64 (or even /127 if the equipment supports it), but choosing persistent IPv6 assigned prefixes for end-user LANs will avoid a lot of difficulties experienced by some earlier IPv6 network operators.

This is especially the case where there are non-residential customers as well, as this means you can have a single provisioning system and it is unnecessary to maintain a logging system. This is because each user/site always have the same prefix(es) and can be identified in the AAA or provisioning system, reducing complexity and making things cheaper. A bit of initial thought, planning and consideration for future needs can therefore save a great deal of time and energy when IPv6 has been deployed.

From the economic/business perspective, another important consideration with persistent prefixes is that it is possible to ‘name' value added services using DNS (e.g. camera1.username.ispname.com) that can result in considerable new income streams. Trying to deploy new services or applications with non-persistent prefixes is always more difficult and costly, and will increase time spent on troubleshooting. This is just one example to make clear that persistent prefixes enable innovation, new services and applications, which in turn means new business possibilities.

Further to the above, it should be noted that persistent assignments of prefixes to customers may increase the incentive for customers to remain with that ISP, and result in decreased customer churn.

Finally, if you're unconvinced about the use of persistent prefixes, you should at least consider using non-persistent but long-lived assignments so the lease time is as long as your provisioning system allows.

Posted on [January 11, 2021January 27, 2021](https://anderstrier.dk/2021/01/11/my-isp-is-killing-my-idle-ssh-sessions-yours-might-be-too/) by [ato](https://anderstrier.dk/author/ato/)
# My ISP Is Killing My Idle SSH Sessions. Yours Might Be Too.

tl;dr: My ISP’s CGNAT session timeout is too short, meaning TCP keepalives gets dropped. Test if your own NAT, or your ISP’s CGN, violates [RFC5382](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5382)‘s REQ-5 using this tool: <https://github.com/AndersTrier/NAT-TCP-test>.

I have been working from home more lately, where I have SSH sessions open to the servers that I’m working on. Often when I return to my computer, or switch to a SSH session that has been sitting idle for a while, the SSH connection is either dead or frozen. If the session is not already dead, the only way to gain control over my terminal again, is to send the ‘terminate connection’ [ssh escape sequence](https://lonesysadmin.net/2011/11/08/ssh-escape-sequences-aka-kill-dead-ssh-sessions/) **<enter>~.** after which SSH errors like this:

```
[[email protected]](/cdn-cgi/l/email-protection):~$
client_loop: send disconnect: Broken pipe
```

This happened one day while I was transferring a VM image in the hundreds of gigabytes from one server to another using netcat like so:

```
ato@host2:~$ nc -l 1337 > hugefile
ato@host1:~$ nc -q 1 host2 1337 < hugefile
```

This transfer would take multiple hours, and when I checked in after it should have finished, my SSH connections had died yet again. And sshd had taken netcat down with it, killing the transfer midway.

That’s when I decided to investigate this problem.

The OpenBSD and OpenSSH developers are known for their extreme focus on code quality. The chances that this problem is caused by a bug in OpenSSH are very slim. (In the same line as “It is (almost) never a compiler error.”)

This is probably a network problem.

I connected my laptop directly to my ISP’s “customer-provided equipment”: a coax modem in bridge mode. Then I ran tcpdump both on my laptop and on the server, and opened a SSH connection. After leaving it idle for about 2 1/2 hours, this is the result:

Client: 100.68.156.34 / 203.0.113.1, server: 130.225.254.99.

Client side

![](https://anderstrier.dk/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/ssh-session-serverside.png)

Server side

A SSH session does not generate any traffic, unless there’s new output or input. The same is true for TCP. That is why, after the TCP and SSH sessions have been established, no more packages are sent for a long time.

First thing to note, is that my laptop gets an IP in the [Carrier-grade NAT address space 100.64.0.0/10](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc6598), which my ISP then translates to a public internet routable IP. (Because I don’t want to leak my public IP, I used the [tcprewrite](https://tcpreplay.appneta.com/wiki/tcprewrite) tool to substitute that IP with one in [TEST-NET-3](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5737)).

Next thing to note, is that after about 2 hours, both the client and the server starts to send TCP-keepalive packages, but none of them come through to the other side.

Finally the client gives up on the TCP session, and sends a TCP reset package, which surprisingly goes through.

Lets see what we can find in the OpenSSH man pages about timeouts and keepalives (ssh\_config(5)):

```
TCPKeepAlive
    Specifies whether the system should send TCP keepalive messages to the other side.  If they are sent, death of the
    connection or crash of one of the machines will be properly noticed.  This option only uses TCP keepalives (as op‐
    posed to using ssh level keepalives), so takes a long time to notice when the connection dies.  As such, you proba‐
    bly want the ServerAliveInterval option as well.  However, this means that connections will die if the route is down
    temporarily, and some people find it annoying.
    The default is yes (to send TCP keepalive messages), and the client will notice if the network goes down or the re‐
    mote host dies.  This is important in scripts, and many users want it too.
    To disable TCP keepalive messages, the value should be set to no.  See also ServerAliveInterval for protocol-level
    keepalives.
ServerAliveInterval
    Sets a timeout interval in seconds after which if no data has been received from the server, ssh(1) will send a mes‐
    sage through the encrypted channel to request a response from the server.  The default is 0, indicating that these
    messages will not be sent to the server, or 300 if the BatchMode option is set (Debian-specific).
```

So **TCPKeepAlive** enables keepalives handled by the TCP stack implementation (Linux in my case), whereas **ServerAliveInterval** enables protocol level keep-alives (handled by OpenSSH).

This explains the behavior we’re observing, but also raises new questions:

1. Can I fix my problem by enabling the ssh protocol-level-keepalives? (ServerAliveInterval)
2. Why are the TCP keepalives only sent after 2 hours?
3. Why is my ISP dropping my TCP keepalive packages?

I verified that by setting **ServerAliveInterval** to 300 (5 min), my problems disappeared. We could stop now that I found a workaround, but let’s keep digging.

The TCP keepalive interval on Linux is configured by **net.ipv4.tcp\_keepalive\_time**, which by default is set to 2 hours (7200).

```
anders@ubuntu-desktop:~$ sysctl net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time
net.ipv4.tcp_keepalive_time = 7200
```

Why is it set to two hours? We find our answer in [RFC1122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122):

```
Keep-alive packets MUST only be sent when no data or
acknowledgement packets have been received for the
connection within an interval.  This interval MUST be
configurable and MUST default to no less than two hours.
```

In the following DISCUSSION section, the RFC writers elaborate on why they (in 1989) think TCP keep-alives only should be sent infrequently:

```
The TCP specification does not include a keep-alive mechanism because it could:
(1) cause perfectly good connections to break during transient Internet failures;
(2) consume unnecessary bandwidth ("if no one is using the connection, who cares if it is still good?"); and
(3) cost money for an Internet path that charges for packets.
```

Today the Internet is different from what it was in 1989 when they published that RFC. Now we have NAT everywhere, which is a hack that was accepted on IPv4 because the IPv4 address space is too small. The real solution is IPv6 which has a much bigger address space (2^32 vs 2^128).

NAT (Network Address Translation) allows many computers on a network to share the same IP. This typically works by routing your packet to a device which translates/substitutes your private [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) IP (e.g 192.168.0.0/16) for a public one, and passes on the packet.

CGN (Carrier-grade NAT) is NAT run by an ISP. This allows for many customers to share a single public IP (because even with every household being assigned a single IPv4, we’re still running out). To avoid collisions with the [RFC1918](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1918) ranges, ISPs are told to use the 100.64.0.0/10 range. With this setup it is not uncommon to have 3 levels of NAT. Ex, CGN, CPE that also does NAT, and the customers own router.

A NAT device must keep track of which connections are made by the clients. This information is stored in the NAT table. Whenever a packet arrives from the Internet, it checks if the packet belongs to a connection in its NAT table, to determine which client to send the package to. If it doesn’t belong to any connections, it drops the packet.

This wouldn’t work if the NAT table only stored IP addresses – which client should the NAT device send the packet to if receiving a packet from a server two of its clients are connected to? That is why – unlike routers – NAT devices have to cross protocol boundaries, and look deeper inside the packet, and find a “[transport identifier](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc3022)“. For TCP and UDP the identifiers used are the source and destination port numbers, and for ICMP the Query [Identifier](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc792) is usually used.

A NAT table looks something like this (we’ll ignore ICMP for now):

```
PROTOCOL SRCIP       SRCPORT DSTIP          DSTPORT NEWSRCPORT IDLETIME
TCP      192.168.1.1 52264   130.225.254.99 22      52264      983
UDP      192.168.1.2 39252   8.8.8.8        53      39252      0
```

This NAT hack unfortunately opened up Pandora’s box of problems that we are still dealing with today. For example, you can no longer initiate a connection to a computer behind NAT. The NAT device does not know which host to send the packet to. This is why NAT’ing is often equated with firewalling. It is not a feature as such. It is a side effect of the NAT hack.

Back when NAT was introduced, it was not uncommon for protocols to rely on the server establishing a second connection back to the client. In “Active FTP” for example, the server will initiate a new connection back to the client (the data channel) after the client has connected. For this to work the NAT must be even more protocol aware, and preemptively create a mapping for the requested port. The same is true for SIP (used for VoIP) and a few other protocols. This is why most NAT devices can be configured to be FTP and SIP aware. Exactly this feature was recently shown to be a huge security problem – you can trigger this functionality to create a mapping of your choosing from a visitors browser, and connect to any device behind the visitors NAT. Read more about the [NAT Slipstreaming attack here](https://github.com/samyk/slipstream).

For big data transfers, or latency sensitive connections (file sharing, VoIP, gaming etc) it is very much preferable to have a direct connection between hosts. But if both hosts are behind a NAT, this is not immediately possible. To solve this problem, a new hack was introduced: [NAT hole punching](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5389), where you – by using a third-party – can trick your NAT devices to allow traffic directly between the hosts by creating a NAT table entry (“punching” a hole) in both NATs simultaneously. It is only somewhat reliable, and works best with UDP in my experience.

NAT is also one of the reasons the new [QUIC](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/draft-ietf-quic-transport/?include_text=1) protocol uses UDP packages instead of its own protocol. Too many devices will fail to handle the packet correctly if they introduced a new [protocol number](https://www.iana.org/assignments/protocol-numbers/protocol-numbers.xhtml) to use in the IP header. Where should the NAT device look for a transport identifier in an unknown protocol header?

Another problem that arises because of NAT is: when is it safe to remove an entry from the NAT table? Sometimes the answer is simple: when you see that the connection has been closed (e.g the TCP Normal Close Sequence). But when is it safe to remove an established TCP connection (were you haven’t yet seen the connection being closed) on which no packages have been sent for a long time? Lets check what [RFC5382: NAT Behavioral Requirements for TCP](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc5382) has to say.

```
TCP connections can stay in established phase indefinitely without
exchanging any packets.  Some end-hosts can be configured to send
keep-alive packets on such idle connections; by default, such keep-
alive packets are sent every 2 hours if enabled [[RFC1122](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc1122)].
Consequently, a NAT that waits for slightly over 2 hours can detect
idle connections with keep-alive packets being sent at the default
rate.

REQ-5:  If a NAT cannot determine whether the endpoints of a TCP
connection are active, it MAY abandon the session if it has been
idle for some time.  In such cases, the value of the "established
connection idle-timeout" MUST NOT be less than 2 hours 4 minutes.
```

On Linux this timeout is controlled by [nf\_conntrack\_tcp\_timeout\_established](https://www.kernel.org/doc/Documentation/networking/nf_conntrack-sysctl.txt) which by default is 5 days. On OpenWRT for example this is lowered to 7440 seconds (2 hours and 4 minutes) to work better on slow hardware.

Alright. Enough rant about NAT. Let’s begin probing my ISP to test if they respect the 2 hours and 4 minutes timeout.

I wrote three different tests which can be found here: <https://github.com/AndersTrier/NAT-TCP-test>

The idea is to establish a TCP connection to a server, wait some time and then send some data to test if the connection still works. This way we can discover the timeout period before the NAT will drop the connection. Using a single TCP connection at a time, this would take forever. Instead the tests will spawn 130 connections on startup, and test the first connection after 1 minute, the second after 2 minutes and so on (2 hours and 10 minutes total).

**tcp-send-test** will do exactly that.

**tcp-recv-test** will instead ask the server to test the connections (i.e be the one to try and send some send data after waiting).

**tcp-keepalive-test** works essentially the same way as tcp-send-test, but instead of sending actual data, it will use TCP-keepalives. (Maybe my ISP simply drops all keepalive packages?)

By default, the tests are configured to connect to a server sponsored by the non-profit organization [dotsrc.org](https://dotsrc.org/).

This is the output from **tcp-send-test** when I tested my ISP:

We found the culprit! The connection tested after waiting slightly more than 60 minutes didn’t work, meaning they dropped the connection from their NAT table. 1 hour is too short time for them to wait – they should wait at least 2 hours and 4 minutes. I documented my findings, and sent an email to my ISP. I quickly got a response back acknowledging that this is a bug on their side, and thanking me for my research. They still haven’t fixed the problem though.

The tcp-keepalive-test gave the same result, but strangely enough the tcp-recv-test reported all connections as working. I assume this is because I pay my ISP to have a static public IPv4 mapped to my CGN address. But then why did the server’s keepalive packages get dropped in the SSH example? I speculate that my ISP drops those because they don’t refer to a valid TCP session anymore.

Actually they shouldn’t track my connections at all – they should just forward all packages, and only translate the source or destination IP. But that’s a problem for another day.

If you run the tests, you should start both **tcp-send-test** and **tcp-recv-test**. I’ve seen some CGN implementations that only fail the **tcp-recv-test**.

Here’s what a test looks like with a NAT/CGN that is RFC compliant:

```
anders@ubuntu-laptop:~/git/NAT-TCP-test$ ./tcp-recv-test
 [+] All connections established
 [+] Waiting for the server to close a connection
 [+] Open connections: 130
 [+] Connection 0 returned after 1m 0s: 60

 [+] Waiting for the server to close a connection
 [+] Open connections: 129
 [+] Connection 1 returned after 2m 0s: 120

[...]

 [+] Waiting for the server to close a connection
 [+] Open connections: 8
 [+] Connection 122 returned after 123m 11s: 7380

 [+] Waiting for the server to close a connection
 [+] Open connections: 7

/* no more output produced by the application */
```

Thanks for reading! I hope you learned something. I’m available for hire. I do computer security and networking. Shoot me an email at hi@<this domain>.

Update: I heard back from my ISP. They told me that the session timeout on their CGN is more than a day, so they continued to investigate the problem (using the tooling I wrote).

They were able to determine that it is actually the cable/coax modem (provided by my ISP) that is killing my idle connections! When put in “bridge mode” it still does connection tracking, and it drops packages which do not belong to any known connections. On this device the idle-timeout is 1 hour. This timeout should be updated to be at least 2 hours and 4 minutes, but it would be even better if it didn’t do any connection tracking at all while in bridge mode.
