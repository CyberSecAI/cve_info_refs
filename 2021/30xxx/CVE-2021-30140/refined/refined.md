Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-30140

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of input during web page generation, specifically when handling file names without extensions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is that the application does not properly sanitize file names, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code within a file, particularly when the file lacks an extension. This injected code gets stored in the system and is executed when the filename is clicked.
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The system fails to validate and sanitize file names, allowing for the injection of harmful code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** This could lead to various malicious activities, such as stealing cookies, session hijacking, redirecting users to malicious sites, or manipulating content.
- **Compromised Admin Account:** In the described scenario, the administrator's account is impacted as the XSS payload is triggered when an admin views messages containing the malicious file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Email:** The vulnerability is triggered through the "send email" functionality.
- **Malicious File:** An attacker crafts a file with no extension containing malicious SVG and Javascript code.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user (in the scenario described, an administrator) to click on the filename to trigger the stored XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **External User:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a user of the affected system.
- **Ability to Create Malicious File:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a file with malicious SVG content and no file extension.
- **Social Engineering (Minimal):**  The attacker needs to send the malicious file to a user who might click the filename.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a file without an extension containing an SVG with Javascript code is sent via email.
- The exploit code provided is an SVG file with an embedded JavaScript alert.
- The vulnerability exists within the "Data/Messages" section where message attachments are viewed.
- The vulnerable version is LiquidFiles 3.4.15. The issue is resolved in version 3.5.

**Additional Notes:**
The provided content gives a clear description of the vulnerability, steps to reproduce, and the timeline of disclosure. It's a stored XSS and is triggered upon user interaction (clicking on the filename of the malicious file).
