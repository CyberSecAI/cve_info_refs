Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-30175

**Description:** ZEROF Web Server 1.0 (April 2021 version) is vulnerable to SQL Injection on the login page.

**Root Cause:**
The web application fails to properly sanitize and filter user-supplied input parameters before using them in SQL queries.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection: The application is susceptible to SQL injection due to lack of input sanitization.

**Impact:**
- Code Execution: Successful exploitation of the SQL injection vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability also enables an attacker to access sensitive information stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The attack can be performed remotely.
- HTTP POST Request: The attack vector involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/HandleEvent` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the server running the vulnerable ZEROF Web Server application.
- Knowledge of the API: The attacker must know or be able to identify the vulnerable parameters used in the SQL queries within the application's API (`O33` and `O37` in the example).

**Technical Details:**
- The provided example demonstrates an injection attempt using the following POST parameters within the `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` body:
    - `Ajax=1&IsEvent=1&Obj=O4F&Evt=click&this=O4F&"_fp_=_S_ID=CteTYLjmYw108029DC1&O33=%020%02%02'&O37=%020%02%02fff"&_seq_=2&_uo_=O`
- The injected payload is within the values of parameters `O33` and `O37`.
- The server response includes a JavaScript alert containing the MySQL error message, confirming that the injected SQL syntax was indeed executed.

**Additional Information:**
