- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue in Wi-Fi authentication mechanism.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to force a client to use a less secure authentication mechanism.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker within Wi-Fi range can potentially compromise the security of the connection by forcing the client to use a weaker authentication method.
- **Attack vectors**: Attacker must be within WiFi range of the target device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in close proximity to the targeted device, specifically within the range of the Wi-Fi network.
