Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-30499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a global buffer overflow in the `export_troff` function within the `export.c` file of the `libcaca` library. This occurs because the `sprintf` function, used to format data, always appends a null byte ('\0') at the end of the string. The allocated buffer for the formatted string, in cases where image size is zero, doesn't account for this null terminator, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Global Buffer Overflow:**  The `sprintf` function writes beyond the allocated buffer boundaries when exporting to troff format, causing a global buffer overflow.
*   **Incorrect Memory Allocation:** The memory allocated for the export process does not take into consideration the extra byte appended by the `sprintf` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The buffer overflow leads to memory corruption, which can potentially cause a variety of issues, including:
*   **Crash/Denial of Service:** Overwriting memory can lead to application crashes or unexpected behavior, potentially resulting in a denial-of-service.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Although not explicitly mentioned in the provided text, memory corruption vulnerabilities can sometimes be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. This depends on the context of the overflow and how the memory is subsequently used.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Importing specially crafted input:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing specially crafted image data when using the `caca_import_canvas_from_memory` function, in combination with exporting to troff via `caca_export_canvas_to_memory`. This means a malicious actor can supply a specially crafted input that results in a zero image size being passed to the export function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to supply input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input to a program that uses the `libcaca` library. This could be through a file, network stream or any other means of supplying data.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific input that will trigger the vulnerability to exploit the buffer overflow.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found using the libfuzz library API and was reproducible across different Linux distributions (Ubuntu 20.04, Fedora 33) with different compiler versions.
*   The fix involves either:
    *   Replacing the `sprintf` calls with manual memory manipulation or similar functionality that doesn't append the null byte, in functions like `export_tga`.
    *   Silently allocating one additional byte for the buffer in function like `export_troff` , or only when the size of the image is 0x0, to accommodate the null byte.
*   The issue was addressed in `libcaca` version `0.99.beta20`.
*   The vulnerability is closely related to CVE-2021-30498, which involves a similar heap buffer overflow in the `export_tga` function.
