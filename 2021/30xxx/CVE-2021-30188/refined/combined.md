3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS Control runtime system enables embedded or PC-based devices to be a programmable
industrial controller. It provides a communication server for the communication with clients like the CODESYS
Development System. This server has the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2021-30186: CWE-122: Heap-based Buffer Overflow
A crafted request may cause a heap-based buffer overflow in the affected CODESYS products, resulting in a
denial-of-service condition.

CVE-2021-30188: CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
A crafted request may cause a stack-based buffer overflow in the affected CODESYS products, resulting in a
denial-of-service condition or being utilized for remote code execution.

CVE-2021-30195: CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
A crafted request may cause a buffer over-read in the affected CODESYS products, resulting in a denial-of-
service condition.

The crafted requests are only processed on the controller, if no online password is configured on the controller
or if the attacker has previously successfully authenticated himself at the controller.

3.2  Exploitability

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

5  Mitigation

CODESYS GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerabilities.

Currently, CODESYS GmbH has not identified any specific workarounds for these vulnerabilities, in case the
software update is not applied.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to
reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Use encrypted communication links
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
