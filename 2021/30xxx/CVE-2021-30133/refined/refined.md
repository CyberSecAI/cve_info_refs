Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-30133:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization in the CloverDX Server's Simple HTTP API. Specifically, the `sessionToken` parameter of API methods was vulnerable to the injection of arbitrary script or HTML.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS flaw. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the context of a user's browser when interacting with the affected CloverDX Server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script/HTML Injection:** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript or HTML code via the vulnerable parameter.
*   **Account Hijacking:**  By exploiting XSS, an attacker could potentially steal session tokens or other sensitive information, leading to account hijacking.
*   **Malicious Actions:** The attacker could perform actions on behalf of the logged-in user. This might include executing arbitrary jobs or accessing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to interact with a malicious link crafted by the attacker. This is often achieved via social engineering tactics.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `sessionToken` parameter of Simple HTTP API methods serves as the entry point for the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the target CloverDX Server.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of how the `sessionToken` parameter is handled in the Simple HTTP API.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on a malicious link or interacting with attacker-controlled website.

**Additional Information:**
* The vulnerability affects all methods of the Simple HTTP API.
*   The advisory mentions that this is a **high severity** vulnerability and that it can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE) in combination with CSRF (CVE-2021-29995) by allowing the attacker to execute arbitrary jobs through a logged-in user.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Patryk Bogusz.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in CloverDX versions 5.10.0, 5.9.1, 5.8.2, and 5.7.1.

The provided document also includes mitigation steps if updating the CloverDX installation is not immediately possible, such as disabling the Simple HTTP API, restricting access to the CloverDX server instances, and limiting user permissions.
