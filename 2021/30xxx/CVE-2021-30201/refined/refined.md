However, there is still a risk that cybercriminals will try to gain access to the remaining devices that haven’t been patched yet. Among the four vulnerabilities detailed in the security advisory, two (CVE-2024-53704 and CVE-2024-40762) are detectable through scans on the public internet.\n    In collaboration with [Thijs Alkemade](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/thijs-alkemade?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) (Computest), DIVD-CSIRT has developed a fingerprint to identify vulnerable instances. Currently, case lead [Alwin Warringa](https://nl.linkedin.com/in/alwinwarringa?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) (DIVD) and DIVD researchers are scanning the public web for unpatched systems. Network owners with unpatched systems will be notified as quickly as possible.\n    🤝 We would like to do a big shoutout to [Computest](https://nl.linkedin.com/company/computest?trk=organization_guest_main-feed-card-text) for contacting us soon after their discovery.
