{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation in the file download functionality. The application directly concatenates user-provided `filePath` parameter with the configured `uploadPath` without sanitization. This allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside of the intended upload directory.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path Traversal",
    "Arbitrary File Download"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server's file system, potentially including sensitive data such as configuration files, source code, or database credentials.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack is performed by sending an HTTP request to the `/common/sysFile/download` endpoint, including a crafted `filePath` parameter with path traversal sequences.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the application and be able to send HTTP requests to it.  The example provided indicates the attacker needs to be logged into the background management interface. No specific credentials other than access to this interface is specified."
