Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Issues API, where it bypasses the `add_issue_notes` permission check. This means that a user could potentially add notes to issues even if they lack the necessary permission to do so through the regular user interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:** The core weakness is the missing or inadequate permission check within the Issues API, leading to an authorization bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Note Addition:** An attacker could add arbitrary notes to issues, potentially leading to:
    *   **Data modification:** Tampering with issue records and discussions.
    *   **Information disclosure (indirect):** Adding notes could reveal sensitive information if the attacker crafts them to expose data.
    *   **Disruption:** Adding irrelevant or misleading notes can disrupt issue tracking and communication.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Issues API:** The primary attack vector is through direct interaction with the Redmine Issues API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Redmine:** The attacker must have some form of access to the Redmine instance.
*   **API Interaction:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Redmine Issues API, indicating a technical user or an attacker with knowledge of API usage.
*   **Insufficient Permissions (for the UI):** The attacker needs to be in a state where they do not have the `add_issue_notes` permission through the regular UI, but can still access and use the API.

**Summary**

The vulnerability is a high severity issue, as it allows unauthorized modification of issue data through the API. The fix is available in Redmine versions 4.1.2 and 4.0.8 and later.

The Debian security advisory confirms that this CVE affects Redmine and was fixed in version 3.3.1-4+deb9u4 for Debian 9.
