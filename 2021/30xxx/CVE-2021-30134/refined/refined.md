- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in test files within the `php-mod/curl` library. These files lack proper response headers before outputting user input, which allows for reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected XSS vulnerability in the test files of the `php-mod/curl` library.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts into a web page through user-supplied input. When a victim visits the crafted URL, the injected script executes within their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, cookie theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted URLs that contain malicious scripts in the `key` parameter of the vulnerable test files. For example, a GET request to `/tests/server/php-curl-test/post_file_path_upload.php` with a malicious script in the `key` parameter, or a POST request to `/tests/server/php-curl-test/post_multidimensional.php` with a malicious script in the data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with a malicious script and convince a victim to access that URL. No special privileges are required.
