| There is a integer overflow in media\_tools/av\_parsers.c:6568, function hevc\_parse\_slice\_segment. Below code: ` pps\_id = gf\_bs\_read\_ue\_log(bs, "pps\_id"); if (pps\_id >= 64) return -1;  ``` pps = &hevc->pps[pps_id]; sps = &hevc->sps[pps->sps_id]; si->sps = sps; si->pps = pps;  ```  ` However, function may return a negative number to pps\_id, which smaller than 64. Results a crash in followed execution.
