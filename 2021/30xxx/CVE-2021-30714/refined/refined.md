- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A race condition in `AVEVideoEncoder`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Race condition leading to unexpected behavior and potential memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An application may be able to cause unexpected system termination or write to kernel memory.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application could trigger the race condition.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A local attacker with the ability to run a malicious application.
