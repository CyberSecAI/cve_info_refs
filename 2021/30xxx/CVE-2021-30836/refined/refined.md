**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to process the malicious audio file. This could be through a website or a malicious application.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before version 2.32.4, macOS Monterey 12.0.1, watchOS 8, tvOS 15, and iOS/iPadOS 15 and 14.8.
