Subject: CVE-2021-30465: runc <1.0.0-rc95 vulnerable to symlink-exchange
 attack

This vulnerability was made public on 2021-05-19 10:00:00 UTC.

[ Summary ]

runc 1.0.0-rc94 and earlier are vulnerable to a symlink exchange attack whereby
an attacker can request a seemingly-innocuous container configuration that
actually results in the host filesystem being bind-mounted into the container
(allowing for a container escape). CVE-2021-30465 has been assigned for this
issue.

An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom
volume configuration, and while recommended container hardening mechanisms such
as LSMs (AppArmor/SELinux) and user namespaces will restrict the amount of
damage an attacker could do, they do not block this attack outright. We have a
reproducer using Kubernetes (and the below description mentions
Kubernetes-specific paths), but this is not a Kubernetes-specific issue.

The now-released runc v1.0.0-rc95[1] contains a fix for this issue, we
recommend users update as soon as possible. I have also attached the standalone
patch. If you have any questions please direct them to the public runc
bug-tracker or <security@...ncontainers.org> if they are security-critical.

[ Details ]

In circumstances where a container is being started, and runc is mounting
inside a volume shared with another container (which is conducting a
symlink-exchange attack), runc can be tricked into mounting outside of the
container rootfs by swapping the target of a mount with a symlink due to a
time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) flaw. This is fairly similar in style to
previous TOCTTOU attacks (and is a problem we are working on solving with
libpathrs[2]).

However, this alone is not useful because this happens inside a mount namespace
with `MS_SLAVE` propagation applied to `/` (meaning that the mount doesn't
appear on the host -- it's only a "host-side mount" inside the container's
namespace). To exploit this, you must have additional mount entries in the
configuration that use some subpath of the mounted-over host path as a source
for a subsequent mount.

However, it turns out with some container orchestrators (such as Kubernetes --
though it is very likely that other downstream users of runc could have similar
behaviour be accessible to untrusted users), the existence of additional volume
management infrastructure allows this attack to be applied to gain access to
the host filesystem without requiring the attacker to have completely arbitrary
control over container configuration.

In the case of Kubernetes, this is exploitable by creating a symlink in a
volume to the top-level (well-known) directory where volumes are sourced from
(for instance,
`/var/lib/kubelet/pods/$MY_POD_UID/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir`), and then
using that symlink as the target of a mount. The source of the mount is an
attacker controlled directory, and thus the source directory from which
subsequent mounts will occur is an attacker-controlled directory. Thus the
attacker can first place a symlink to `/` in their malicious source directory
with the name of a volume, and a subsequent mount in the container will
bind-mount `/` into the container.

Applying this attack requires the attacker to start containers with a slightly
peculiar volume configuration (though not explicitly malicious-looking such as
bind-mounting `/` into the container explicitly), and be able to run malicious
code in a container that shares volumes with said volume configuration. It
helps the attacker if the host paths used for volume management are well known,
though this is not a hard requirement.

[ Patches ]

I have attached the upstream patch (CVE-2021-30465.patch), a patch which
applies cleanly on 1.0.0-rc94 (rc94-*.patch) and a patchset which applies on
rc93 (rc93-*.patch). But for obvious reasons we highly recommend just updating
to runc 1.0.0-rc95.

[ Workarounds ]

There are no known workarounds for this issue.

However, users who enforce running containers with more confined security
profiles (such as reduced capabilities, not running code as root in the
container, user namespaces, AppArmor/SELinux, and seccomp) will restrict what
an attacker can do in the case of a container breakout -- we recommend users
make use of strict security profiles if possible (most notably user namespaces
-- which can massively restrict the impact a container breakout can have on the
host system).

[ Summary ]  runc 1.0.0-rc94 and earlier are vulnerable to a symlink exchange attack whereby an attacker can request a seemingly-innocuous container configuration that actually results in the host filesystem being bind-mounted into the container (allowing for a container escape). CVE-2021-30465 has been assigned for this issue.  An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom volume configuration, and while recommended container hardening mechanisms such as LSMs (AppArmor/SELinux) and user namespaces will restrict the amount of damage an attacker could do, they do not block this attack outright. We have a reproducer using Kubernetes (and the below description mentions Kubernetes-specific paths), but this is not a Kubernetes-specific issue.  The now-released runc v1.0.0-rc95[1] contains a fix for this issue, we recommend users update as soon as possible. I have also attached the standalone patch. If you have any questions please direct them to the public runc bug-tracker or <security@opencontainers.org> if they are security-critical.  [ Details ]  In circumstances where a container is being started, and runc is mounting inside a volume shared with another container (which is conducting a symlink-exchange attack), runc can be tricked into mounting outside of the container rootfs by swapping the target of a mount with a symlink due to a time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) flaw. This is fairly similar in style to previous TOCTTOU attacks (and is a problem we are working on solving with libpathrs[2]).  However, this alone is not useful because this happens inside a mount namespace with `MS_SLAVE` propagation applied to `/` (meaning that the mount doesn't appear on the host -- it's only a "host-side mount" inside the container's namespace). To exploit this, you must have additional mount entries in the configuration that use some subpath of the mounted-over host path as a source for a subsequent mount.  However, it turns out with some container orchestrators (such as Kubernetes -- though it is very likely that other downstream users of runc could have similar behaviour be accessible to untrusted users), the existence of additional volume management infrastructure allows this attack to be applied to gain access to the host filesystem without requiring the attacker to have completely arbitrary control over container configuration.  In the case of Kubernetes, this is exploitable by creating a symlink in a volume to the top-level (well-known) directory where volumes are sourced from (for instance, `/var/lib/kubelet/pods/$MY_POD_UID/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir`), and then using that symlink as the target of a mount. The source of the mount is an attacker controlled directory, and thus the source directory from which subsequent mounts will occur is an attacker-controlled directory. Thus the attacker can first place a symlink to `/` in their malicious source directory with the name of a volume, and a subsequent mount in the container will bind-mount `/` into the container.  Applying this attack requires the attacker to start containers with a slightly peculiar volume configuration (though not explicitly malicious-looking such as bind-mounting `/` into the container explicitly), and be able to run malicious code in a container that shares volumes with said volume configuration. It helps the attacker if the host paths used for volume management are well known, though this is not a hard requirement.  [ Patches ]  I have attached the upstream patch (CVE-2021-30465.patch), a patch which applies cleanly on 1.0.0-rc94 (rc94-*.patch) and a patchset which applies on rc93 (rc93-*.patch). But for obvious reasons we highly recommend just updating to runc 1.0.0-rc95.  [ Workarounds ]  There are no known workarounds for this issue.  However, users who enforce running containers with more confined security profiles (such as reduced capabilities, not running code as root in the container, user namespaces, AppArmor/SELinux, and seccomp) will restrict what an attacker can do in the case of a container breakout -- we recommend users make use of strict security profiles if possible (most notably user namespaces -- which can massively restrict the impact a container breakout can have on the host system).

Subject: CVE-2021-30465: runc <1.0.0-rc95 vulnerable to symlink-exchange
 attack

This vulnerability was made public on 2021-05-19 10:00:00 UTC.

[ Summary ]

runc 1.0.0-rc94 and earlier are vulnerable to a symlink exchange attack whereby
an attacker can request a seemingly-innocuous container configuration that
actually results in the host filesystem being bind-mounted into the container
(allowing for a container escape). CVE-2021-30465 has been assigned for this
issue.

An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom
volume configuration, and while recommended container hardening mechanisms such
as LSMs (AppArmor/SELinux) and user namespaces will restrict the amount of
damage an attacker could do, they do not block this attack outright. We have a
reproducer using Kubernetes (and the below description mentions
Kubernetes-specific paths), but this is not a Kubernetes-specific issue.

The now-released runc v1.0.0-rc95[1] contains a fix for this issue, we
recommend users update as soon as possible. I have also attached the standalone
patch. If you have any questions please direct them to the public runc
bug-tracker or <security@...ncontainers.org> if they are security-critical.

[ Details ]

In circumstances where a container is being started, and runc is mounting
inside a volume shared with another container (which is conducting a
symlink-exchange attack), runc can be tricked into mounting outside of the
container rootfs by swapping the target of a mount with a symlink due to a
time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) flaw. This is fairly similar in style to
previous TOCTTOU attacks (and is a problem we are working on solving with
libpathrs[2]).

However, this alone is not useful because this happens inside a mount namespace
with `MS_SLAVE` propagation applied to `/` (meaning that the mount doesn't
appear on the host -- it's only a "host-side mount" inside the container's
namespace). To exploit this, you must have additional mount entries in the
configuration that use some subpath of the mounted-over host path as a source
for a subsequent mount.

However, it turns out with some container orchestrators (such as Kubernetes --
though it is very likely that other downstream users of runc could have similar
behaviour be accessible to untrusted users), the existence of additional volume
management infrastructure allows this attack to be applied to gain access to
the host filesystem without requiring the attacker to have completely arbitrary
control over container configuration.

In the case of Kubernetes, this is exploitable by creating a symlink in a
volume to the top-level (well-known) directory where volumes are sourced from
(for instance,
`/var/lib/kubelet/pods/$MY_POD_UID/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir`), and then
using that symlink as the target of a mount. The source of the mount is an
attacker controlled directory, and thus the source directory from which
subsequent mounts will occur is an attacker-controlled directory. Thus the
attacker can first place a symlink to `/` in their malicious source directory
with the name of a volume, and a subsequent mount in the container will
bind-mount `/` into the container.

Applying this attack requires the attacker to start containers with a slightly
peculiar volume configuration (though not explicitly malicious-looking such as
bind-mounting `/` into the container explicitly), and be able to run malicious
code in a container that shares volumes with said volume configuration. It
helps the attacker if the host paths used for volume management are well known,
though this is not a hard requirement.

[ Patches ]

I have attached the upstream patch (CVE-2021-30465.patch), a patch which
applies cleanly on 1.0.0-rc94 (rc94-*.patch) and a patchset which applies on
rc93 (rc93-*.patch). But for obvious reasons we highly recommend just updating
to runc 1.0.0-rc95.

[ Workarounds ]

There are no known workarounds for this issue.

However, users who enforce running containers with more confined security
profiles (such as reduced capabilities, not running code as root in the
container, user namespaces, AppArmor/SELinux, and seccomp) will restrict what
an attacker can do in the case of a container breakout -- we recommend users
make use of strict security profiles if possible (most notably user namespaces
-- which can massively restrict the impact a container breakout can have on the
host system).

This release of runc contains a fix for [CVE-2021-30465](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-c3xm-pvg7-gh7r), and users are

strongly recommended to update (especially if you are providing

semi-limited access to spawn containers to untrusted users).

Aside from this security fix, only a few other changes were made since

v1.0.0-rc94 (the only user-visible change was the addition of support

for defaultErrnoRet in seccomp profiles).

### Static Linking Notices

The `runc` binary distributed with this release are *statically linked* with

the following [GNU LGPL-2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html) licensed libraries, with `runc` acting

as a "work that uses the Library":

* [libseccomp](https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp)

The versions of these libraries were not modified from their upstream versions,

but in order to comply with the LGPL-2.1 (§6(a)), we have attached the

complete source code for those libraries which (when combined with the attached

runc source code) may be used to exercise your rights under the LGPL-2.1.

However we strongly suggest that you make use of your distribution's packages

or download them from the authoritative upstream sources, especially since

these libraries are related to the security of your containers.

* Aleksa Sarai cyphar@cyphar.com
* Giuseppe Scrivano gscrivan@redhat.com
* Kir Kolyshkin kolyshkin@gmail.com
* Mrunal Patel mrunal@me.com

Due to the nature of this release, it didn't go through the normal

public release procedure. However, this break from procedure was agreed

upon on the security mailing list.

```
Because the target of a mount is inside a container (which may be a
volume that is shared with another container), there exists a race
condition where the target of the mount may change to a path containing
a symlink after we have sanitised the path -- resulting in us
inadvertently mounting the path outside of the container.

This is not immediately useful because we are in a mount namespace with
MS_SLAVE mount propagation applied to "/", so we cannot mount on top of
host paths in the host namespace. However, if any subsequent mountpoints
in the configuration use a subdirectory of that host path as a source,
those subsequent mounts will use an attacker-controlled source path
(resolved within the host rootfs) -- allowing the bind-mounting of "/"
into the container.

While arguably configuration issues like this are not entirely within
runc's threat model, within the context of Kubernetes (and possibly
other container managers that provide semi-arbitrary container creation
privileges to untrusted users) this is a legitimate issue. Since we
cannot block mounting from the host into the container, we need to block
the first stage of this attack (mounting onto a path outside the
container).

The long-term plan to solve this would be to migrate to libpathrs, but
as a stop-gap we implement libpathrs-like path verification through
readlink(/proc/self/fd/$n) and then do mount operations through the
procfd once it's been verified to be inside the container. The target
could move after we've checked it, but if it is inside the container
then we can assume that it is safe for the same reason that libpathrs
operations would be safe.

A slight wrinkle is the "copyup" functionality we provide for tmpfs,
which is the only case where we want to do a mount on the host
filesystem. To facilitate this, I split out the copy-up functionality
entirely so that the logic isn't interspersed with the regular tmpfs
logic. In addition, all dependencies on m.Destination being overwritten
have been removed since that pattern was just begging to be a source of
more mount-target bugs (we do still have to modify m.Destination for
tmpfs-copyup but we only do it temporarily).

## Affected versions

<= 1.0.0-rc94

## Patched versions

1.0.0-rc95

## Description

### Summary

runc 1.0.0-rc94 and earlier are vulnerable to a symlink exchange attack whereby

an attacker can request a seemingly-innocuous container configuration that

actually results in the host filesystem being bind-mounted into the container

(allowing for a container escape). [CVE-2021-30465](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c3xm-pvg7-gh7r "CVE-2021-30465") has been assigned for this

issue.

An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom

volume configuration, and while recommended container hardening mechanisms such

as LSMs (AppArmor/SELinux) and user namespaces will restrict the amount of

damage an attacker could do, they do not block this attack outright. We have a

reproducer using Kubernetes (and the below description mentions

Kubernetes-specific paths), but this is not a Kubernetes-specific issue.

The now-released [runc v1.0.0-rc95](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc95) contains a fix for this issue, we

recommend users update as soon as possible.

### Details

In circumstances where a container is being started, and runc is mounting

inside a volume shared with another container (which is conducting a

symlink-exchange attack), runc can be tricked into mounting outside of the

container rootfs by swapping the target of a mount with a symlink due to a

time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) flaw. This is fairly similar in style to

previous TOCTTOU attacks (and is a problem we are working on solving with

libpathrs).

However, this alone is not useful because this happens inside a mount namespace

with `MS_SLAVE` propagation applied to `/` (meaning that the mount doesn't

appear on the host -- it's only a "host-side mount" inside the container's

namespace). To exploit this, you must have additional mount entries in the

configuration that use some subpath of the mounted-over host path as a source

for a subsequent mount.

However, it turns out with some container orchestrators (such as Kubernetes --

though it is very likely that other downstream users of runc could have similar

behaviour be accessible to untrusted users), the existence of additional volume

management infrastructure allows this attack to be applied to gain access to

the host filesystem without requiring the attacker to have completely arbitrary

control over container configuration.

In the case of Kubernetes, this is exploitable by creating a symlink in a

volume to the top-level (well-known) directory where volumes are sourced from

(for instance,

`/var/lib/kubelet/pods/$MY_POD_UID/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir`), and then

using that symlink as the target of a mount. The source of the mount is an

attacker controlled directory, and thus the source directory from which

subsequent mounts will occur is an attacker-controlled directory. Thus the

attacker can first place a symlink to `/` in their malicious source directory

with the name of a volume, and a subsequent mount in the container will

bind-mount `/` into the container.

Applying this attack requires the attacker to start containers with a slightly

peculiar volume configuration (though not explicitly malicious-looking such as

bind-mounting `/` into the container explicitly), and be able to run malicious

code in a container that shares volumes with said volume configuration. It

helps the attacker if the host paths used for volume management are well known,

though this is not a hard requirement.

### Patches

This has been patched in runc 1.0.0-rc95, and users should upgrade as soon as

possible. The patch itself can be found [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0ca91f44f1664da834bc61115a849b56d22f595f).

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds for this issue.

However, users who enforce running containers with more confined security

profiles (such as reduced capabilities, not running code as root in the

container, user namespaces, AppArmor/SELinux, and seccomp) will restrict what

an attacker can do in the case of a container breakout -- we recommend users

make use of strict security profiles if possible (most notably user namespaces

-- which can massively restrict the impact a container breakout can have on the

host system).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

This library implements a set of C-friendly APIs (written in Rust) to make path
resolution within a potentially-untrusted directory safe on GNU/Linux. There
are countless examples of security vulnerabilities caused by bad handling of
paths (symlinks make the issue significantly worse).

### Example

#### Root and Handle API

Here is a toy example of using this library to open a path (`/etc/passwd`)
inside a root filesystem (`/path/to/root`) safely. More detailed examples can
be found in `examples/` and `tests/`.

```
#include <pathrs.h>

int get_my_fd(void)
{
	const char *root_path = "/path/to/root";
	const char *unsafe_path = "/etc/passwd";

	int liberr = 0;
	int root = -EBADF,
		handle = -EBADF,
		fd = -EBADF;

	root = pathrs_open_root(root_path);
	if (root < 0) {
		liberr = root;
		goto err;
	}

	handle = pathrs_inroot_resolve(root, unsafe_path);
	if (handle < 0) {
		liberr = handle;
		goto err;
	}

	fd = pathrs_reopen(handle, O_RDONLY);
	if (fd < 0) {
		liberr = fd;
		goto err;
	}

err:
	if (liberr < 0) {
		pathrs_error_t *error = pathrs_errorinfo(liberr);
		fprintf(stderr, "Uh-oh: %s (errno=%d)\n", error->description, error->saved_errno);
		pathrs_errorinfo_free(error);
	}
	close(root);
	close(handle);
	return fd;
}
```

#### Safe `procfs` API

`libpathrs` also provides a set of primitives to safely interact with `procfs`.
This is very important for some programs (such as container runtimes), because
`/proc` has several key system administration purposes that make it different
to other filesystems. It particular, `/proc` is used:

1. As a mechanism for doing certain filesystem operations through
   `/proc/self/fd/...` (and other similar magic-links) that cannot be done by
   other means.
2. As a source of true information about processes and the general system (such
   as by looking `/proc/$pid/status`).
3. As an administrative tool for managing processes (such as setting LSM labels
   like `/proc/self/attr/apparmor/exec`).

These operations have stronger requirements than regular filesystems. For (1)
we need to open the magic-link for real (magic-links are symlinks that are not
resolved lexically, they are in-kernel objects that warp you to other files
without doing a regular path lookup) which much harder to do safely (even with
`openat2`). For (2) and (3) we have the requirement that we need to open a
specific file, not just any file within `/proc` (if there are overmounts or
symlinks) which is not the case `pathrs_inroot_resolve()`. As a result, it is
necessary to take far more care when doing operations of `/proc` and
`libpathrs` provides very useful helper to do this. Failure to do so can lead
to security issues such as those in [CVE-2019-16884](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-16884) and
[CVE-2019-19921](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2019-19921).

In addition, with the [new mount API](https://lwn.net/Articles/759499/) (`fsopen(2)` and
`open_tree(2)` in particular, added in Linux 5.2), it is possible to get a
totally private `procfs` handle that can be used without worrying about racing
mount operations. `libpathrs` will try to use this if it can (this usually
requires root).

Here are a few examples of practical things you might want to do with
`libpathrs`'s `procfs` API:

```
/*
 * Safely get an fd to /proc/self/exe. This is something runc does to re-exec
 * itself during the container setup process.
 */
int get_self_exe(void)
{
    /* This follows the trailing magic-link! */
    int fd = pathrs_proc_open(PATHRS_PROC_SELF, "exe", O_PATH);
    if (fd < 0) {
        pathrs_error_t *error = pathrs_errorinfo(fd);
        /* ... print the error ... */
        pathrs_errorinfo_free(error);
        return -1;
    }
    return fd;
}

/*
 * Safely set the AppArmor exec label for the current process. This is
 * something runc does while configuring the container process.
 */
int write_apparmor_label(const char *label)
{
    int fd, err;

    /*
     * Note the usage of O_NOFOLLOW here. You should use O_NOFOLLOW except in
     * the very rare case where you need to open a magic-link or you really
     * want to follow a trailing symlink.
     */
    fd = pathrs_proc_open(PATHRS_PROC_SELF, "attr/apparmor/exec",
                          O_WRONLY|O_NOFOLLOW);
    if (fd < 0) {
        pathrs_error_t *error = pathrs_errorinfo(fd);
        /* ... print the error ... */
        pathrs_errorinfo_free(error);
        return -1;
    }

    err = write(fd, label, strlen(label));
    close(fd);
    return err;
}

/*
 * Sometimes you need to get the "real" path of a file descriptor. This path
 * MUST NOT be used for actual filesystem operations, because it's possible for
 * an attacker to move the file or change one of the path components to a
 * symlink, which could lead to you operating on files you didn't expect
 * (including host files if you're a container runtime).
 *
 * In most cases, this kind of function would be used for diagnostic purposes
 * (such as in error messages, to provide context about what file the error is
 * in relation to).
 */
char *get_unsafe_path(int fd)
{
    char *fdpath;

    if (asprintf(&fdpath, "fd/%d", fd) < 0)
        return NULL;

    int linkbuf_size = 128;
    char *linkbuf = malloc(size);
    if (!linkbuf)
        goto err;
    for (;;) {
        int len = pathrs_proc_readlink(PATHRS_PROC_THREAD_SELF,
                                       fdpath, linkbuf, linkbuf_size);
        if (len < 0) {
            pathrs_error_t *error = pathrs_errorinfo(fd);
            /* ... print the error ... */
            pathrs_errorinfo_free(error);
            goto err;
        }

        if (len <= linkbuf_size)
            break;

        linkbuf_size = len;
        linkbuf = realloc(linkbuf, linkbuf_size);
        if (!linkbuf)
            goto err;
    }

    free(fdpath);
    return linkbuf;

err:
    free(fdpath);
    free(linkbuf);
    return NULL;
}
```

### Kernel Support

`libpathrs` is designed to only work with Linux, as it uses several Linux-only
APIs.

`libpathrs` was designed alongside [`openat2(2)`](https://www.man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/openat2.2.html) (available since
Linux 5.6) and dynamically tries to use the latest kernel features to provide
the maximum possible protection against racing attackers. However, it also
provides support for older kernel versions (in theory up to Linux 2.6.39 but we
do not currently test this) by emulating newer kernel features in userspace.

However, we strongly recommend you use at least Linux 5.8 to get a reasonable
amount of protection against various attacks, and ideally at least Linux 6.8 to
make use of all of the protections we have implemented. See the following table
for what kernel features we optionally support and what they are used for.

| Feature | Minimum Kernel Version | Description | Fallback |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| `openat2(2)` | Linux 5.6 (2020-03-29) | In-kernel restrictions of path lookup. This is used extensively by `libpathrs` to safely do path lookups. | Userspace emulated path lookups. |
| `/proc/thread-self` | Linux 3.17 (2014-10-05) | Used when operating on the current thread's `/proc` directory for use with `PATHRS_PROC_THREAD_SELF`. | `/proc/self/task/$tid` is used, but this might not be available in some edge cases so `/proc/self` is used as a final fallback. |
| New Mount API | Linux 5.2 (2019-07-07) | Used to create a private procfs handle when operating on `/proc` (with `fsopen(2)` or `open_tree(2)`). | Open a regular handle to `/proc`. This can lead to certain race attacks if the attacker can dynamically create mounts. |
| `STATX_MNT_ID` | Linux 5.8 (2020-08-02) | Used to verify whether there are bind-mounts on top of `/proc` that could result in insecure operations. | There is **no fallback**. Not using this protection can lead to fairly trivial attacks if an attacker can configure your mount table. |
| `STATX_MNT_ID_UNIQUE` | Linux 6.8 (2024-03-10) | Used for the same reason as `STATX_MNT_ID`, but allows us to protect against mount ID recycling. This is effectively a safer version of `STATX_MNT_ID`. | `STATX_MNT_ID` is used (see the `STATX_MNT_ID` fallback if it's not available either). |

For more information about the work behind `openat2(2)`, you can read the
following LWN articles (note that the merged version of `openat2(2)` is
different to the version described by LWN):

* [New AT\_ flags for restricting pathname lookup](https://lwn.net/Articles/767547/)
* [Restricting path name lookup with openat2()](https://lwn.net/Articles/796868/)

Package        : runc
Version        : 1.0.0~rc6+dfsg1-3+deb10u2
CVE ID         : CVE-2019-16884 CVE-2019-19921 CVE-2021-30465 CVE-2022-29162
                 CVE-2023-27561
Debian Bug     : 942026 988768

Multiple vulnerabilities were discovered in runc, the Open Container
Project runtime, which is often used with virtualization environments
such as Docker. Malicious Docker images or OCI bundles could breach
isolation.

CVE-2019-16884

    runc, as used in Docker and other products, allows AppArmor and
    SELinux restriction bypass because libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go
    incorrectly checks mount targets, and thus a malicious Docker
    image can mount over a /proc directory.

CVE-2019-19921

    runc has Incorrect Access Control leading to Escalation of
    Privileges, related to libcontainer/rootfs_linux.go. To exploit
    this, an attacker must be able to spawn two containers with custom
    volume-mount configurations, and be able to run custom
    images. (This vulnerability does not affect Docker due to an
    implementation detail that happens to block the attack.)

CVE-2021-30465

    runc allows a Container Filesystem Breakout via Directory
    Traversal. To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker must be able
    to create multiple containers with a fairly specific mount
    configuration. The problem occurs via a symlink-exchange attack
    that relies on a race condition.

CVE-2022-29162

    `runc exec --cap` created processes with non-empty inheritable
    Linux process capabilities, creating an atypical Linux environment
    and enabling programs with inheritable file capabilities to
    elevate those capabilities to the permitted set during
    execve(2). This bug did not affect the container security sandbox
    as the inheritable set never contained more capabilities than were
    included in the container's bounding set.

CVE-2023-27561

    CVE-2019-19921 was re-introduced by the fix for CVE-2021-30465.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1.0.0~rc6+dfsg1-3+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your runc packages.

For the detailed security status of runc please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/runc>

[runc v1.2.4 -- "Христос се роди!"](/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.2.4)
[Latest](/opencontainers/runc/releases/latest)

[Latest](/opencontainers/runc/releases/latest)

This is the fourth patch release of the 1.2.z release branch of runc. It

includes a fix for a regression introduced in 1.2.0 related to the

default device list.

* Re-add tun/tap devices to built-in allowed devices lists.

  In runc 1.2.0 we removed these devices from the default allow-list

  (which were added seemingly by accident early in Docker's history) as

  a precaution in order to try to reduce the attack surface of device

  inodes available to most containers ([#3468](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3468)). At the time we thought

  that the vast majority of users using tun/tap would already be

  specifying what devices they need (such as by using `--device` with

  Docker/Podman) as opposed to doing the `mknod` manually, and thus

  there would've been no user-visible change.

  Unfortunately, it seems that this regressed a noticeable number of

  users (and not all higher-level tools provide easy ways to specify

  devices to allow) and so this change needed to be reverted. Users

  that do not need these devices are recommended to explicitly disable

  them by adding deny rules in their container configuration. ([#4555](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4555),

  [#4556](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4556))

[runc v1.2.3 -- "Winter is not a season, it's a celebration."](/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.2.3)

This is the third patch release of the 1.2.z release branch of runc. It

primarily fixes some minor regressions introduced in 1.2.0.

* Fixed a regression in use of securejoin.MkdirAll, where multiple

  runc processes racing to create the same mountpoint in a shared rootfs

  would result in spurious EEXIST errors. In particular, this regression

  caused issues with BuildKit. ([#4543](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4543), [#4550](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4550))
* Fixed a regression in eBPF support for pre-5.6 kernels after upgrading

  Cilium's eBPF library version to 0.16 in runc. ([#3008](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/3008), [#4551](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4551))

[runc v1.2.2 -- "Specialization is for insects."](/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.2.2)

This is the second patch release of the 1.2.z branch of runc. It

includes two fixes for problems introduced in runc 1.2.0, as well as

some documentation improvements surrounding the overlayfs /proc/self/exe

protections.

* Fixed the failure of `runc delete` on a rootless container with no

  dedicated cgroup on a system with read-only `/sys/fs/cgroup` mount.

  This is a regression in runc 1.2.0, causing a failure when using

  rootless buildkit. ([#4518](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4518), [#4531](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4531))
* Using runc on a system where /run/runc and /usr/bin are on different

  filesystems no longer results in harmless but annoying messages

  ("overlayfs: "xino" feature enabled using 3 upper inode bits")

  appearing in the kernel log. ([#4508](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4508), [#4530](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4530))
* Better memfd-bind documentation. ([#4530](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4530))
* CI: bump Fedora 40 -> 41. ([#4528](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4528))

[runc v1.2.1 -- "No existe una escuela que enseñe a vivir."](/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.2.1)

This is the first patch release of the 1.2.z series of runc. It includes

a critical bugfix for an issue that manifested on SELinux-based

distributions and was blocking containerd from updating to

runc 1.2.z.

In addition, runc-dmz (added in 1.2.0) has been removed entirely. This

was opt-in (due to the many limitations it had), but the late addition

of the overlayfs-based [CVE-2019-5736](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gxmr-w5mj-v8hh "CVE-2019-5736") protection made it no longer

necessary at all.

* We now explicitly become root after joining an existing user namespace.

  Otherwise, runc won't have permissions to configure some mounts when

  running under SELinux and runc is not creating the user namespace.

  ([#4466](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4466), [#4477](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4477))

* Remove dependency on `golang.org/x/sys/execabs` from go.mod. ([#4480](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4480))
* Remove runc-dmz, that had many limitations, and is mostly made obsolete by

  the new protection mechanism added in v1.2.0. Note that runc-dmz was only

  available only in the 1.2.0 release and required to set an environment variable

  to opt-in. ([#4488](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4488))

* The `script/check-config.sh` script now checks for overlayfs support. ([#4494](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4494))
* When using cgroups v2, allow to set or update memory limit to "unlimited"

  and swap limit to a specific value. ([#4501](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4501))

[runc v1.2.0 -- "できるときにできることをやるんだ。それが今だ。"](/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.2.0)

This is the long-awaited release of runc 1.2.0! The primary changes from rc3

are general improvements and fixes for minor regressions related to the

new /proc/self/exe cloning logic in runc 1.2, follow-on patches related

to [CVE-2024-45310](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-jfvp-7x6p-h2pv "CVE-2024-45310"), as well as some other minor changes.

* In order to alleviate the remaining concerns around the memory usage and

  (arguably somewhat unimportant, but measurable) performance overhead of

  memfds for cloning `/proc/self/exe`, we have added a new protection using

  `overlayfs` that is used if you have enough privileges and the running

  kernel supports it. It has effectively no performance nor memory overhead

  (compared to no cloning at all). ([#4448](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4448))
* The original fix for [CVE-2024-45310](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/security/advisories/GHSA-jfvp-7x6p-h2pv) was intentionally very

  limited in scope to make it easier to review, however it also did not handle

  all possible `os.MkdirAll` cases and thus could lead to regressions. We have

  switched to the more complete implementation in the newer versions of

  `github.com/cyphar/filepath-securejoin`. ([#4393](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4393), [#4400](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4400), [#4421](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4421), [#4430](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4430))
* In certain situations (a system with lots of mounts or racing mounts) we

  could accidentally end up leaking mounts from the container into the host.

  This has been fixed. ([#4417](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4417))
* The fallback logic for `O_TMPFILE` clones of `/proc/self/exe` had a minor

  bug that would cause us to miss non-`noexec` directories and thus fail to

  start containers on some systems. ([#4444](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4444))
* Sometimes the cloned `/proc/self/exe` file descriptor could be placed in a

  way that it would get clobbered by the Go runtime. We had a fix for this

  already but it turns out it could still break in rare circumstances, but it

  has now been fixed. ([#4294](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4294), [#4452](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4452))
* It is not possible for `runc kill` to work properly in some specific

  configurations (such as rootless containers with no cgroups and a shared pid

  namespace). We now output a warning for such configurations. ([#4398](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4398))
* memfd-bind: update the documentation and make path handling with the systemd

  unit more idiomatic. ([#4428](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4428))
* We now use v0.16 of Cilium's eBPF library, including fixes that quite a few

  downstreams asked for. ([#4397](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4397), [#4396](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4396))
* Some internal `runc init` synchronisation that was no longer necessary (due

  to the `/proc/self/exe` cloning move to Go) was removed. ([#4441](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4441))

[v1.1.15 -- "How, dear sir, did you cross the flood? By not stopping, friend, and by not straining I crossed the flood."](/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.15)

This is the fifteenth patch release in the 1.1.z release branch of runc.

It fixes a few issues with seccomp, leaked mounts, and system performance.

* The `-ENOSYS` seccomp stub is now always generated for the native

  architecture that `runc` is running on. This is needed to work around some

  arguably specification-incompliant behaviour from Docker on architectures

  such as ppc64le, where the allowed architecture list is set to `null`. This

  ensures that we always generate at least one `-ENOSYS` stub for the native

  architecture even with these weird configs. ([#4391](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4391))
* On a system with older kernel, reading `/proc/self/mountinfo` may skip some

  entries, as a consequence runc may not properly set mount propagation,

  causing container mounts leak onto the host mount namespace. ([#2404](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/2404), [#4425](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4425))
* In order to fix performance issues in the "lightweight" bindfd protection

  against [[CVE-2019-5736](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-gxmr-w5mj-v8hh "CVE-2019-5736")], the temporary `ro` bind-mount of `/proc/self/exe`

  has been removed. runc now creates a binary copy in all cases. ([#4392](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4392), [#2532](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/2532))

[runc v1.2.0-rc.2 -- "TRUE or FALSE, it's a problem!"](/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.2.0-rc.2)
Pre-release

Pre-release

This is the second release candidate for the 1.2.0 branch of runc. It includes

all patches and bugfixes included in runc 1.1 patch releases (up to and

including 1.1.13). A fair few new features have been added, and some changes

have been made which may affect users. Please help us thoroughly test this

release candidate before we release 1.2.0.

### Breaking

* runc now requires a minimum of Go 1.20 to compile. If building with

  Go 1.22, make sure to use 1.22.4 or later version ([#4233](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4233)).
* libcontainer/cgroups users who want to manage cgroup devices need to

  explicitly import libcontainer/cgroups/devices. ([#3452](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3452), [#4248](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4248))

### Security

* The `runc` binaries provided here were built with go1.21.11, which includes [a

  security fix for `os.RemoveAll`](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/a3a584e4abad776f4b8e5cab5b5923724fdf75d9) to fix a bug that would allow an attacker to

  trick runc into deleting a directory on the host. We encourage users to update,

  and if they build `runc` themselves, make sure they build their binaries using

  go1.21.11 or later, or go1.22.4 or later.

### Added

* CI: add actuated-arm64. ([#4142](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4142), [#4252](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4252), [#4276](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4276))

### Fixed

* cgroup v2: do not set swap to 0 or unlimited when it's not available. ([#4188](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4188))
* Set the default value of CpuBurst to nil instead of 0. ([#4210](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4210), [#4211](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4211))
* libct/cg: write unified resources line by line. ([#4186](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4186))
* libct.Start: fix locking, do not allow a second container init. ([#4271](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4271))
* Fix tests in debian testing (mount\_sshfs.bats). ([#4245](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4245))
* libct/cg/dev: fix TestSetV1Allow panic. ([#4295](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4295))
* tests/int/scheduler: require smp. ([#4298](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4298))

### Changed

* libct/cg/fs: don't write cpu\_burst twice on ENOENT. ([#4259](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4259))
* Make trimpath optional. ([#3908](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/3908))
* Remove unused system.Execv. ([#4268](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4268))
* Stop blacklisting Go 1.22+, drop Go < 1.21 support, use Go 1.22 in CI. ([#4292](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4292))
* Improve some error messages for runc exec. ([#4320](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4320))
* ci/gha: bump golangci-lint[-action]. ([#4255](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4255))
* tests/int/tty: increase the timeout. ([#4260](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4260))
* [ci] use go mod instead of go get in spec.bats. ([#4264](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4264))
* tests/int/checkpoint: rm double logging. ([#4251](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4251))
* ci/gha: bump golangci-lint-action from 5 to 6. ([#4275](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4275))
* .cirrus.yml: rm FIXME from rootless fs on CentOS 7. ([#4279](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4279))
* Dockerfile: bump Debian to 12, Go to 1.21. ([#4296](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4296))
* ci/gha: switch to ubuntu 24.04. ([#4286](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4286))
* Vagrantfile.fedora: bump to F40. ([#4285](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/pull/4285))

[runc 1.1.13 -- "There is no certainty in the world. This is the only certainty I have."](/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.1.13)

This is the thirteenth patch release in the 1.1.z release branch of runc. It

brings in Go 1.22.x compatibility and fixes a few issues, including an

occasional wrong nofile rlimit in runc exec, and a race between runc list and

runc delete.

NOTE that if using Go 1.22.x to build runc, make sure to use 1.22.4 or a later version.

For more details, see issue [#4233](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/issues/4233).

### Security

* The `runc` binaries provided here were built with go1.21.11, which includes [a

  security fix for `os.RemoveAll`](https://github.com/golang/go/commit/a3a584e4abad776f4b8e5cab5b5923724fdf75d9) to fix a bug that would allow an attacker to

  trick runc into deleting a directory on the host. We encourage users to update,

  and if they build `runc` themselves, make sure they build their binaries using

  go1.21.11 or later, or go1.22.4 or later.

### Static Linking Notices

The `runc` binary distributed with this release are *statically linked* with

the following [GNU LGPL-2.1](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/old-licenses/lgpl-2.1.en.html) licensed libraries, with `runc` acting

as a "work that uses the Library":

* [libseccomp](https://github.com/seccomp/libseccomp)

The versions of these libraries were not modified from their upstream versions,

but in order to comply with the LGPL-2.1 (§6(a)), we have attached the

complete source code for those libraries which (when combined with the attached

runc source code) may be used to exercise your rights under the LGPL-2.1.

However we strongly suggest that you make use of your distribution's packages

or download them from the authoritative upstream sources, especially since

these libraries are related to the security of your containers.

# mount destinations can be swapped via symlink-exchange to cause mounts outside the rootfs

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<=1.0.0-rc94

## Patched versions

1.0.0-rc95

## Description

### Summary

runc 1.0.0-rc94 and earlier are vulnerable to a symlink exchange attack whereby

an attacker can request a seemingly-innocuous container configuration that

actually results in the host filesystem being bind-mounted into the container

(allowing for a container escape). [CVE-2021-30465](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-c3xm-pvg7-gh7r "CVE-2021-30465") has been assigned for this

issue.

An attacker must have the ability to start containers using some kind of custom

volume configuration, and while recommended container hardening mechanisms such

as LSMs (AppArmor/SELinux) and user namespaces will restrict the amount of

damage an attacker could do, they do not block this attack outright. We have a

reproducer using Kubernetes (and the below description mentions

Kubernetes-specific paths), but this is not a Kubernetes-specific issue.

The now-released [runc v1.0.0-rc95](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/releases/tag/v1.0.0-rc95) contains a fix for this issue, we

recommend users update as soon as possible.

### Details

In circumstances where a container is being started, and runc is mounting

inside a volume shared with another container (which is conducting a

symlink-exchange attack), runc can be tricked into mounting outside of the

container rootfs by swapping the target of a mount with a symlink due to a

time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) flaw. This is fairly similar in style to

previous TOCTTOU attacks (and is a problem we are working on solving with

libpathrs).

However, this alone is not useful because this happens inside a mount namespace

with `MS_SLAVE` propagation applied to `/` (meaning that the mount doesn't

appear on the host -- it's only a "host-side mount" inside the container's

namespace). To exploit this, you must have additional mount entries in the

configuration that use some subpath of the mounted-over host path as a source

for a subsequent mount.

However, it turns out with some container orchestrators (such as Kubernetes --

though it is very likely that other downstream users of runc could have similar

behaviour be accessible to untrusted users), the existence of additional volume

management infrastructure allows this attack to be applied to gain access to

the host filesystem without requiring the attacker to have completely arbitrary

control over container configuration.

In the case of Kubernetes, this is exploitable by creating a symlink in a

volume to the top-level (well-known) directory where volumes are sourced from

(for instance,

`/var/lib/kubelet/pods/$MY_POD_UID/volumes/kubernetes.io~empty-dir`), and then

using that symlink as the target of a mount. The source of the mount is an

attacker controlled directory, and thus the source directory from which

subsequent mounts will occur is an attacker-controlled directory. Thus the

attacker can first place a symlink to `/` in their malicious source directory

with the name of a volume, and a subsequent mount in the container will

bind-mount `/` into the container.

Applying this attack requires the attacker to start containers with a slightly

peculiar volume configuration (though not explicitly malicious-looking such as

bind-mounting `/` into the container explicitly), and be able to run malicious

code in a container that shares volumes with said volume configuration. It

helps the attacker if the host paths used for volume management are well known,

though this is not a hard requirement.

### Patches

This has been patched in runc 1.0.0-rc95, and users should upgrade as soon as

possible. The patch itself can be found [here](https://github.com/opencontainers/runc/commit/0ca91f44f1664da834bc61115a849b56d22f595f).

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds for this issue.

However, users who enforce running containers with more confined security

profiles (such as reduced capabilities, not running code as root in the

container, user namespaces, AppArmor/SELinux, and seccomp) will restrict what

an attacker can do in the case of a container breakout -- we recommend users

make use of strict security profiles if possible (most notably user namespaces

-- which can massively restrict the impact a container breakout can have on the

host system).
