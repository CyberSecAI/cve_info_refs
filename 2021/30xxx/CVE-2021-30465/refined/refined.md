{
  "CVE-2021-30465": {
    "Description": "runc 1.0.0-rc94 and earlier are vulnerable to a symlink exchange attack whereby an attacker can request a seemingly-innocuous container configuration that actually results in the host filesystem being bind-mounted into the container (allowing for a container escape).",
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "Time-of-check-to-time-of-use (TOCTTOU) flaw where the target of a mount can be swapped with a symlink after path sanitization, leading to mounting outside the container rootfs.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "TOCTTOU flaw",
      "Symlink exchange attack",
      "Insufficient validation of mount destinations"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain access to the host filesystem, potentially leading to container escape, disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to be able to start containers with a custom volume configuration that involves mounting a shared volume where a symlink is placed to the host's root filesystem, and then using that symlink as a target for a subsequent mount. This can be exploited in environments such as Kubernetes.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to start containers with some kind of custom volume configuration and be able to run malicious code in a container that shares volumes with said configuration. It helps if host paths used for volume management are known."
