Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30874:

**Root Cause:** An authorization issue exists in the `NetworkExtension` component.

**Vulnerability:** An application can install a VPN configuration without requiring user permission due to the authorization flaw.

**Impact:** A malicious application could silently install a VPN configuration, potentially redirecting network traffic through a server controlled by the attacker. This could lead to:

*   **Data interception:** Sensitive data transmitted through the VPN could be captured.
*   **Man-in-the-middle attacks:** Attackers could intercept and modify network traffic.
*   **Phishing:** Users could be redirected to malicious websites mimicking legitimate services.

**Attack Vectors:** A malicious application installed on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to install an application on the target device. This could be achieved by:
*   Tricking the user into installing a malicious application.
*   Exploiting a vulnerability to install a malicious application.

**Affected Systems:**
*   macOS Monterey 12.0.1
*   iOS 15
*   iPadOS 15
