Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30130:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an improper handling of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification within the phpseclib library. Specifically, the library exhibited leniencies when verifying signatures, causing it to accept invalid signatures under certain conditions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

The primary vulnerability is the mishandling of RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. This results in a bypass of the intended authorization controls by allowing the acceptance of invalid signatures. This issue affects multiple versions of phpseclib:
  * phpseclib before 2.0.31
  * phpseclib 3.x before 3.0.7

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to:
  * Bypassing authorization controls by using invalid signatures that should be rejected, therefore allowing potentially unauthorized access.
  * Integrity violations of data relying on RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification, meaning attackers might modify signed data and pass it as valid.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is primarily through network communication where RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification is performed.
*   An attacker would need to provide a crafted, invalid signature to a system utilizing the vulnerable versions of phpseclib.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would need to be in a position to send manipulated data, including invalid signatures, to the vulnerable application or system that relies on phpseclib for signature verification.
*   No specific privileges are required, as the vulnerability lies in how the library handles signature verification.
* No user interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the implementation of RSA signature verification and affects how phpseclib handles padding and other aspects of the PKCS#1 v1.5 standard.
*   The vulnerability is present in both relaxed and strict modes of the RSA signature verification in the case of version 3.x, and in the strict mode for versions 1.0, 2.0 and 3.0.
*   Patches were released to address this vulnerability in versions 2.0.31 and 3.0.7 of phpseclib.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned a high severity rating with a CVSS score of 7.5, and a network attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required and no user interaction required.
