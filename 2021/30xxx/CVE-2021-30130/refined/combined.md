# Debian Long Term Support

Debian Long Term Support (LTS) is a project to extend the lifetime of all Debian stable releases to (at least) 5 years. Debian LTS is not handled by the Debian Security and Release teams, but by a separate group of volunteers and companies interested in making it a success.

Thus the Debian LTS team takes over security maintenance of the various releases once the Debian Security team stops its work.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

| Is this going to be fixed in the version 2.0 branch? We're using version 2.0.4 over at <https://github.com/friendica/friendica-addons> and I would prefer not have to either downgrade to version 2.0.31 or figure out if we can use version 3.0.7. |

| [@MrPetovan](https://github.com/MrPetovan) :  First, the fix is in the 2.0 branch. The release that contains this has been tagged as 2.0.31, which is not a downgrade from 2.0.4 - it's an *upgrade*.  Second, the only vulnerabilities are in the 3.0 branch. Quoting the disclosure (which I can send to you if you'd like; I kinda wish the author would make it public but whatever):  In short, we have found 4 leniencies in phpseclib v3 (relaxed mode)'s RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification (2 vulnerabilities with Bleichenbacher-style low public exponent RSA Signature Forgery and 2 bugs causing interoperability issue [accepting invalid signature value that should have been rejected]). We have also found incompatibility issue in phpseclib v1, v2, v3 (strict mode)'s RSA PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification suffering from rejecting valid signatures whose encoded message uses implicit hash algorithm's NULL parameter.  So to sum it up, there were five issues total.   1. Two were vulnerabilities in v3.0 involving the new RSA::SIGNATURE\_RELAXED\_PKCS1 mode (which doesn't exist in 2.0) 2. Two were bugs in v3.0 involving the new RSA::SIGNATURE\_RELAXED\_PKCS1 mode (which again, doesn't exist in 2.0) 3. One was a bug in v1.0, v2.0 and v3.0.   In other words, v2.0 does not have a vulnerability, according to the original paper. |

| Thank you so much for the answer, for some reason I read 2.0.31 as 2.0.3.1 which would have made it a downgrade from 2.0.4. Sorry about the confusion. |

That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3198-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Sylvain Beucler
November 17, 2022                             <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>
- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : php-phpseclib
Version        : 2.0.30-2~deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-30130

It was discovered that php-phpseclib, a pure-PHP implementation of
various cryptographic and arithmetic algorithms (v2), mishandles RSA
PKCS#1 v1.5 signature verification. An attacker may get invalid
signatures accepted, bypassing authorization control in specific
situations.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
2.0.30-2~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your php-phpseclib packages.

For the detailed security status of php-phpseclib please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/php-phpseclib>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| Hi I try to connect to Nexans microswitch and I have the "Unable to open channel" exception. My code is :  ``` <?php use phpseclib3\Net\SSH2;  require_once ("vendor/autoload.php");  $ssh = new SSH2('192.168.255.165', 22); if (!$ssh->login('admin', 'nexans')) {     throw new \Exception('Login failed'); } define('NET_SSH2_LOGGING', SSH2::LOG_COMPLEX); $output = $ssh->read('~#~', SSH2::READ_REGEX); echo $ssh->getLog();  ```  The error is :  ``` PHP Fatal error:  Uncaught RuntimeException: Unable to open channel in /home/fournier/Programmation/PHP/phpseclib/vendor/phpseclib/phpseclib/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php:3823 Stack trace: #0 /home/fournier/Programmation/PHP/phpseclib/vendor/phpseclib/phpseclib/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php(3529): phpseclib3\Net\SSH2->get_channel_packet(true) #1 /home/fournier/Programmation/PHP/phpseclib/vendor/phpseclib/phpseclib/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php(3401): phpseclib3\Net\SSH2->filter('^\x00\x00\x00\x02\x00\x00\x01\x8F\r\nEnte...', false) #2 /home/fournier/Programmation/PHP/phpseclib/vendor/phpseclib/phpseclib/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php(2783): phpseclib3\Net\SSH2->get_binary_packet() #3 /home/fournier/Programmation/PHP/phpseclib/vendor/phpseclib/phpseclib/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php(2919): phpseclib3\Net\SSH2->initShell() #4 /home/fournier/Programmation/PHP/phpseclib/test.php(11): phpseclib3\Net\SSH2->read('~#~', 2) #5 {main}   thrown in /home/fournier/Programmation/PHP/phpseclib/vendor/phpseclib/phpseclib/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php on line 3823  ```  I update the phpseclib code to display the $type : it is 94, which is not managed by phpseclib.

| [Line 3823](https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/blob/3.0.6/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php#L3823) is a `break` statement so that line number isn't super useful. BUT thankfully there's only one line that throws an "Unable to open channel" exception and that'd be [line 3821](https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/blob/3.0.6/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php#L3821).  Anyway, what I can tell you is that SSH\_MSG\_CHANNEL\_DATA is most definitely supported. From `send_channel_packet`:     [phpseclib/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php](https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/blob/eeabad1ed3cdf91302cd01ec3a4bcf6059e77ffa/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php#L4125-L4130)  Lines 4125 to 4130 in [eeabad1](/phpseclib/phpseclib/commit/eeabad1ed3cdf91302cd01ec3a4bcf6059e77ffa)   |  | $packet = Strings::packSSH2( | | --- | --- | |  | 'CNs', | |  | NET\_SSH2\_MSG\_CHANNEL\_DATA, | |  | $this->server\_channels[$client\_channel], | |  | $temp | |  | ); |      From `get_channel_packet`:     [phpseclib/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php](https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/blob/eeabad1ed3cdf91302cd01ec3a4bcf6059e77ffa/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php#L3841-L3842)  Lines 3841 to 3842 in [eeabad1](/phpseclib/phpseclib/commit/eeabad1ed3cdf91302cd01ec3a4bcf6059e77ffa)   |  | switch ($type) { | | --- | --- | |  | case NET\_SSH2\_MSG\_CHANNEL\_DATA: |      In so far as your error goes... that error would lead me to conclude that the issue is that the server isn't responding to your NET\_SSH2\_MSG\_CHANNEL\_OPEN request with a NET\_SSH2\_MSG\_CHANNEL\_OPEN\_CONFIRMATION response and yet in the SSH logs for your modified version it is:  ``` -> NET_SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN (since last: 0.6647, network: 0s) 00000000  00:00:00:07:73:65:73:73:69:6f:6e:00:00:00:02:7f  ....session..... 00000010  ff:ff:ff:00:00:40:00                             .....@.  <- NET_SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION (since last: 0.0279, network: 0.0001s) 00000000  00:00:00:02:00:00:00:2b:00:00:7d:00:00:00:88:b8  .......+..}.....  ```  So that doesn't make a lot of sense.  If the server *was* responding with a response of "94" then why isn't it showing up in your modified logs either? Logging is done by `get_binary_packet`:     [phpseclib/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php](https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/blob/eeabad1ed3cdf91302cd01ec3a4bcf6059e77ffa/phpseclib/Net/SSH2.php#L3392-L3399)  Lines 3392 to 3399 in [eeabad1](/phpseclib/phpseclib/commit/eeabad1ed3cdf91302cd01ec3a4bcf6059e77ffa)   |  | if (defined('NET\_SSH2\_LOGGING')) { | | --- | --- | |  | $current = microtime(true); | |  | $message\_number = isset($this->message\_numbers[ord($payload[0])]) ? $this->message\_numbers[ord($payload[0])] : 'UNKNOWN (' . ord($payload[0]) . ')'; | |  | $message\_number = '<- ' . $message\_number . | |  | ' (since last: ' . round($current - $this->last\_packet, 4) . ', network: ' . round($stop - $start, 4) . 's)'; | |  | $this->append\_log($message\_number, $payload); | |  | $this->last\_packet = $current; | |  | } |      So that doesn't make a lot of sense to me.  Could you get me the SSH2 logs when you *are* having this issue? The full logs would be ideal as that'd tell me the name of the SSH server you're connecting to as well. Your post mentions Nexans microswitch but the SSH server could be their own home grown one (which would be more likely to be buggy) or OpenSSH (which would be less likely to be buggy).  I'm also kinda wondering if this wasn't maybe a one off issue. ie. if you ran phpseclib again *without* your changes it'd work. |

| First, thanks to look at this !  My modifications were done to skip the exception.  I don't modify the lib source code anymore. Install a fresh version with "composer require phpseclib/phpseclib:~3.0". I modify my source code to catch the exception :  ``` <?php use phpseclib3\Net\SSH2;  require_once ("vendor/autoload.php");  $ssh = new SSH2('192.168.255.165', 22); if (!$ssh->login('admin', 'nexans')) {     throw new \Exception('Login failed'); } define('NET_SSH2_LOGGING', SSH2::LOG_COMPLEX); try {   $output = $ssh->read('~#~', SSH2::READ_REGEX); } catch (RuntimeException $e) { } echo $ssh->getLog(); echo $e->getMessage()."\n";  ```  Then the log is :  ``` -> NET_SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN (since last: 0.7973, network: 0s) 00000000  00:00:00:07:73:65:73:73:69:6f:6e:00:00:00:02:7f  ....session..... 00000010  ff:ff:ff:00:00:40:00                             .....@.  <- NET_SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_OPEN_CONFIRMATION (since last: 0.0253, network: 0.0001s) 00000000  00:00:00:02:00:00:00:2b:00:00:7d:00:00:00:88:b8  .......+..}.....  -> NET_SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST (since last: 0.0003, network: 0.0001s) 00000000  00:00:00:2b:00:00:00:07:70:74:79:2d:72:65:71:01  ...+....pty-req. 00000010  00:00:00:05:76:74:31:30:30:00:00:00:50:00:00:00  ....vt100...P... 00000020  18:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:01:00        ..............  <- NET_SSH2_MSG_CHANNEL_DATA (since last: 0.0263, network: 0.0262s) 00000000  00:00:00:02:00:00:01:8f:0d:0a:45:6e:74:65:72:20  ..........Enter  00000010  63:6f:6d:6d:61:6e:64:20:27:3f:27:20:6f:72:20:27  command '?' or ' 00000020  68:65:6c:70:20:5b:6b:65:79:2d:77:6f:72:64:5d:20  help [key-word]  00000030  5b:6b:65:79:2d:77:6f:72:64:5d:27:20:74:6f:20:73  [key-word]' to s 00000040  65:61:72:63:68:20:63:6f:6d:6d:61:6e:64:73:2e:0d  earch commands.. 00000050  0a:45:78:61:6d:70:6c:65:73:3a:0d:0a:20:3f:20:20  .Examples:.. ?   00000060  20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20                   00000070  20:2d:20:4c:69:73:74:73:20:73:68:6f:72:74:20:64   - Lists short d 00000080  65:73:63:72:69:70:74:69:6f:6e:20:6f:66:20:61:6c  escription of al 00000090  6c:20:63:6f:6d:6d:61:6e:64:73:0d:0a:20:68:65:6c  l commands.. hel 000000a0  70:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20  p                000000b0  20:2d:20:4c:69:73:74:73:20:6c:6f:6e:67:20:64:65   - Lists long de 000000c0  73:63:72:69:70:74:69:6f:6e:20:6f:66:20:61:6c:6c  scription of all 000000d0  20:63:6f:6d:6d:61:6e:64:73:0d:0a:20:68:65:6c:70   commands.. help 000000e0  20:76:6c:61:6e:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20:20   vlan            000000f0  2d:20:4c:69:73:74:73:20:6f:6e:6c:79:20:63:6f:6d  - Lists only com 00000100  6d:61:6e:64:73:20:77:69:74:68:20:6b:65:79:77:6f  mands with keywo 00000110  72:64:20:76:6c:61:6e:0d:0a:20:68:65:6c:70:20:76  rd vlan.. help v 00000120  6c:61:6e:20:69:6e:74:65:72:66:61:63:65:20:2d:20  lan interface -  00000130  4c:69:73:74:73:20:6f:6e:6c:79:20:63:6f:6d:6d:61  Lists only comma 00000140  6e:64:73:20:77:69:74:68:20:6b:65:79:77:6f:72:64  nds with keyword 00000150  20:76:6c:61:6e:20:61:6e:64:20:69:6e:74:65:72:66   vlan and interf 00000160  61:63:65:0d:0a:0d:0a:46:54:54:4f:2d:43:31:2d:41  ace....FTTO-C1-A 00000170  2d:42:44:5a:32:2d:6e:61:2d:31:33:2d:31:34:2d:43  -BDZ2-na-13-14-C 00000180  31:2d:31:30:36:2e:67:72:65:6e:6f:62:6c:65:2e:63  1-106.grenoble.c 00000190  6e:72:73:2e:66:72:23                             nrs.fr#  -> NET_SSH2_MSG_DISCONNECT (since last: 0.0002, network: 0.0001s) 00000000  00:00:00:0b:00:00:00:00:00:00:00:00              ............

Quoting <https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc4254#section-5.4> :  ```    All channel-specific requests use the following format.        byte      SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_REQUEST       uint32    recipient channel       string    request type in US-ASCII characters only       boolean   want reply       ....      type-specific data follows     If 'want reply' is FALSE, no response will be sent to the request.    Otherwise, the recipient responds with either    SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_SUCCESS, SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE, or request-specific    continuation messages.  If the request is not recognized or is not    supported for the channel, SSH_MSG_CHANNEL_FAILURE is returned.  ```  "want reply", in this case, is 0x01, which is true.  Now the specs do say "*or request-specific continuation message*". I suppose I could just interpret the immediate sending of data as a "request-specific continuation message".  So based on your logs an exception *should* be thrown. A "*Unable to request pseudo-terminal*" exception. But the exception you're saying is being thrown is a "*Unable to open channel*", which is just weird.  Regardless... so you said it worked fine in OpenSSH. For good measure can you try it in PuTTY too? And if you can do that can you get me the PuTTY logs? You can get them by going to Session -> Logging -> Session logging and selecting "SSH packets".  If PuTTY is doing the same thing as OpenSSH I'll make it accept SSH\_MSG\_CHANNEL\_DATA messages in response as well. If PuTTY is doing something to somehow avoid the error I'd like to know that too! |

| Does <https://github.com/terrafrost/phpseclib/tree/nexans-3.0> fix the issue for you?  It's hard for me to verify the fix since I don't have a Nexans switch but I can verify that it doesn't break it on an SSH server that doesn't behave as Nexans does! |

| I just made a commit that should fix that.  Sorry about that.  It's failing in the 5.6 unit tests (which are also the most time consuming unit tests) but not the 7.0-8.0 unit tests. I think a lot of that is because GNU Parallels tends to [obscure errors](https://github.com/phpseclib/phpseclib/issues/1548#issuecomment-741494157). It's used because xdebug really slows things down and xdebug, in turn, is used to generate test coverage reports, which I don't really pay too much attention too (tbh I'm not sure 100% test coverage is ever going to be possible). If I remove xdebug the speedups GNU Parallels provide become less important. |

| These changes are in the 1.0 / 2.0 / 3.0 / master branches in the main repo!  I should probably update the behavior in a few other places as well:   * `exec()` when `enablePTY()` has been called * `requestAgentForwarding()` * `startSubsystem()` * `SFTP::login()` |

Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3197-1                debian-lts@lists.debian.org
<https://www.debian.org/lts/security/>                      Sylvain Beucler

- -------------------------------------------------------------------------

Package        : phpseclib
Version        : 1.0.19-3~deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-30130

It was discovered that phpseclib, a pure-PHP implementation of various
cryptographic and arithmetic algorithms (v1), mishandles RSA PKCS#1
v1.5 signature verification. An attacker may get invalid signatures
accepted, bypassing authorization control in specific situations.

For Debian 10 buster, this problem has been fixed in version
1.0.19-3~deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your phpseclib packages.

For the detailed security status of phpseclib please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/phpseclib>

Further information about Debian LTS security advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
found at: <https://wiki.debian.org/LTS>

| When using the stream wrapper to write bytes to a file... trying to write beyond the end of a file does not work. I can work around this with a check for the file size and truncate() call, but this probably should work. It works for local storage, even if the starting offset is also beyond the end of the file. |
