Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30123:

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-30123 is one of multiple vulnerabilities in FFmpeg related to processing malformed AAC audio files. Specifically, a null pointer dereference and stack buffer overflow can occur due to insufficient checks in the AAC decoder, leading to crashes and potential arbitrary code execution.

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is insufficient validation of the input AAC data, leading to:

*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** A null pointer is accessed during memory freeing in `libavutil/mem.c`, specifically within the `av_freep` function. This happens during the cleanup of an SBR context when decoding AAC audio. The code attempts to dereference a pointer that may be null due to incorrect processing of the malformed input.
*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** When processing a malformed AAC file, a stack buffer overflow occurs in the FFmpeg JIT code. This overflow happens during the channel configuration step of the decoding process, specifically in the `che_configure` function. The overflow is triggered by inconsistent channel layout and sample rate information, which causes the code to write beyond the bounds of stack allocated buffers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core weakness is a lack of robust validation of the incoming AAC data. This includes checks for sample rate, channel configuration, and general stream structure.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** In the `av_freep` function a null pointer is dereferenced
*  **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The JIT code does not properly handle cases where the channel layout information in the AAC stream is inconsistent or malformed, leading to an overflow on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The null pointer dereference and stack buffer overflows can lead to crashes and process termination, causing a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution (Potentially):** Although not explicitly stated, a stack buffer overflow of this type can, under certain conditions, be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. This would depend on the specific memory layout, compiler optimizations, and other environmental factors. The provided information primarily shows crashes, but the potential for code execution is inherent in such vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Media Files:** The primary attack vector is to entice a user to open a specially crafted media file (AAC) using FFmpeg. This could happen via:
    *   Downloading a malicious file.
    *   Viewing a video or audio stream that is embedded with malicious AAC data.
    *   Processing a file provided by an attacker.
*  **Input via command line:**  The `ffmpeg -i` command is used with a malicious input file

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create Malicious Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create, or obtain, a specifically crafted AAC file that triggers the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker would require user interaction to open or process the malicious file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Gentoo Security Advisory (GLSA 202105-24) notes that a remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted media file, which may result in arbitrary code execution or a denial of service.
*   The FFmpeg ticket #8863 describes the null pointer dereference issue, showing a crash in `av_freep`, and provides a stack trace indicating the flow of events in the decoder and memory management leading to the crash. A proof of concept (POC) file is attached.
*   The FFmpeg ticket #8845 describes the stack buffer overflow with a crash output, and also provides the configuration information, command to reproduce the issue as well as the analysis of the memory layout of the stack that is overflowed. A POC file is attached.
*   Both issues were fixed by the same commit in FFmpeg: `d6f293353c94c7ce200f6e0975ae3de49787f91f`

In summary, CVE-2021-30123 is a vulnerability that exposes FFmpeg users to potential denial of service and possibly arbitrary code execution due to insufficient input validation and memory management when handling malformed AAC files.
