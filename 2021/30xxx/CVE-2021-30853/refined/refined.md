- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies in the Gatekeeper component, which is responsible for enforcing security policies related to the execution of applications. The specific nature of the vulnerability is not detailed, but it allowed for a bypass of Gatekeeper checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability involved a flaw in how Gatekeeper performs its checks, allowing malicious applications to circumvent its security measures.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploitation could allow a malicious application to bypass Gatekeeper checks.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious application would be the attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to deliver or trick a user into executing a specially crafted malicious application. The attacker could potentially be a local user.
