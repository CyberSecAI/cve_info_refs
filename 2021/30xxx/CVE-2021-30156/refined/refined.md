Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability arises from the `Special:Contributions` page in MediaWiki. When viewing contributions of a suppressed user (a user who has been blocked and their username hidden from edits and lists), the page's toolbar still reveals the existence of the hidden user. This occurs because the toolbar displays links to user talk, logs, etc., which are not shown for non-existent users, thus indicating that the suppressed user exists.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is an information leak. The system is not properly hiding information about suppressed users.
-   **Insufficient Access Control:** The toolbar was rendered without checking if the viewer has the necessary permissions to access details of suppressed users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privacy Violation:** Attackers can discover the existence of suppressed users, which is a privacy violation.
-   **Circumvention of Suppression:** The intended effect of suppressing a user is bypassed.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Direct Access:** An attacker can directly visit the `Special:Contributions` page for a known, suppressed username.
-   **Public Access:** The vulnerability is present for any user, including logged-out users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **No special privileges required:** The attacker only needs to know the username of the suppressed user and visit the `Special:Contributions` page for that user.
-   **No account required:** This can be done by any user, even logged-out users.

**Additional Details:**

-   The fix involved modifying the code to ensure that the toolbar does not display links that reveal the existence of suppressed users.
-   The issue was present in both `master` and `REL1_36` branches of MediaWiki, with a slightly modified fix needed for `REL1_36` due to changes in a related commit.
-   The vulnerability was also related to similar issues with IP ranges.
-   The fix ensures the system behaves as though the suppressed user doesn't exist from the viewer's perspective.
-   The fix was released in MediaWiki versions 1.35.2, 1.36, and 1.37.
