Added support for precise version of setting the system time adjustment. See DTServer / DTClient below for more information. Improved hypervisor detection for machines running on Amazon's EC2 platform (both Intel and AMD). Removed obsolete information from the readme.txt files included with all distributions.   * **DTLinux**   + See the [CHANGELOG.txt](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt) file     for changes specific to DTLinux.  - **DTServer / DTClient**   * Added support for Microsoft's SetSystemTimeAdjustmentPrecise()     on operating systems that support it (Win11 or later, Win2019 or later, and up-to-date versions     of Win10). This functionalty can *significantly* improve accuracy and precision.   * Removed obsolete/unused registry entries from Parameters and     PTPv2 subkeys.   * Improved advanced training calculations to reduce the time     required to determine the optimum value, and also to account for very small     adjustments allowed by SetSystemTimeAdjustmentPrecise().   * Eliminated full reset of filters when changing from one PTP     master to another. This provides a smoother transition event.   * Eliminated error message in log at first timecheck     event if PTP has acquired a master but has not yet recorded any time     samples.   * Changed to allow advanced clock training if the     machine has PTP enabled but is not a slave. Formerly, advanced clock     training was disallowed if PTP was enabled at all. - **All Windows Components**   * Changed the parent window used when displaying     data using Microsoft's notepad.exe. This prevents Windows 11 or     later from treating Notepad as a modal app (which forces you to     close Notepad before continuing with any Domain Time application).   * Included code for auto-closing Notepad on Win11 or later when     Notepad is set to use tabs instead of a new window. - **Audit Server**   * Added a function to clean up stale Real-Time Alerts.     This feature is disabled by default; you may configure it from Manager's     Real-Time Alerts Configuration/Advanced page. "Stale" refers to a node that     is no longer sending Real-Time Alerts, either because the node has been     decommissioned or it has been configured to stop sending Real-Time Alerts.     This function is essentially the same as selecting a node from Manager's     Real-Time Alert page and deleting it. If a deleted node begins sending     Real-Time Alerts again, it will automatically be added back to the list.     The default period of time that must pass before a node is considered stale     is 60 days. The allowed range is 1-365 days. Auto-cleanup activity shows in     Audit Server's log at the Trace level. If enabled, cleanup runs at service     startup and periodically thereafter. - **Manager**   * Improved window position saving/restoring, including     cascading when Manager opens multiple instances of the same program (DTDrift,     DTReader). Also allowed Manager to open graphs and reports above Manager in the     window Z-order and to remain on top. You may enable this new behavior     in Manager's Interface Options dialog.   * Changed several "Do not show again this session" popup     messages into "Do not show again" (your choice is saved in the registry).     All of these confirmation messages pertain to the DTLinux Control Panel     applet built into Manager. Important confirmation messages remain session-based - **Drift Graphs**   * On raw data textual conversions, removed leading     + or − on medians and averages where the value is zero.   * For graphs containing phase information, added a "p"     to the phase number if it refers to precise system time adjustment values.     Precise time adjustments use much larger numbers and vary much more than     ordinary time adjustments. The trailing *p* lets you know why the     phase numbers are outside the normal range.   * Added optional -utc switch to load a graphical drift using     UTC instead of local time. Example: dtdrift -utc c:\windows\system32\drift.dt     Without the -utc parameter, the graph displays points (and raw data) using the     machine's current local time zone.   * Raw data textual conversions now contain the source's     version number in the header (where available and meaningful, i.e., DTLinux,     DTClient, or DTServer). Also added the node type (NTP, PTP, or Drift) and     operating system information (where available).   * Added *Center Window on Screen* to the system menu     (upper-left corner). When clicked, this will move the graph to the center     of the monitor on which it's currently displayed. Shortcut: Alt-Space-W.   * Added *Always on Top* checkbox to the system menu (upper-left     corner) so you can toggle any individual graph from topmost to non-topmost     regardless of how the program was launched. This item only affects the     current window. Shortcut: Alt-Space-A.   * Added *Local timezone* checkbox to the system menu (upper-left     corner) so you can toggle any individual graph back and forth from local time to UTC,     regardless of how the program was launched. This item only affects the     current window. Shortcut: Alt-Space-L.   * Fixed bug in textual conversion of DTAudit-generated     NTP drift graphs that prevented the text from showing the NTP node's source     stratum and leap indicator.   * Enhanced textual conversion of drift data to make the     Time Source field dynamically sized (so any mixture of IPv4 and IPv6 sources     will fit correctly).   * Enhanced textual conversion of PTP drift files to show     the effective NTP stratum of the source. PTP uses stepsRemoved, where zero means     the same as NTP stratum 1 (primary), and so forth. - **DTReader (Audit Report viewer)**   * Added *Center Window on Screen* to the system menu     (upper-left corner). When clicked, this will move the Audit Report to the center     of the monitor on which it's currently displayed. Shortcut: Alt-Space-W.   * Added *Always on Top* checkbox to the system menu (upper-left     corner) so you can toggle any individual Audit Report from topmost to non-topmost     regardless of how the program was launched. This item only affects the     current window. Shortcut: Alt-Space-A. - **Control Panel Applet**   * Added radio buttons Min, Max, and Normal to the dialog     for creating/editing symmetric keys. This control the length of randomly     generated keys. The default is Normal, which generates a key of a length     accepted by most appliances and other servers. Prior versions always     generated the maximum allowed length, meaning you had to manually edit     the result if you wanted a shorter key. - **DTCheck**   * Enhanced -monitorSTA to show both SystemTimeAdjustment     and SystemTimeAdjustmentPrecise (when supported by the operating system).   * Added parameter to -swTimestamps:enable and -swTimestamps:disable     to allow you to specify one (or more) specific adapters. The default operation     is to enable or disable all eligible adapters. To limit the changes, specify     -name=adapter[,adapter...] using the "friendly" adapter name (the one shown when     looking at the list of NICs). For example, to enable NDIS timestamps on the     adapter called *Ethernet*, use -swtimestamps:en -name:Ethernet. If the     friendly name contains spaces, you must enclose the name in double quotation     marks. For exampe, to disable timestamping on *Ethernet 1* and *Ethernet 2*,     use -swtimestamps:disable -name:"Ethernet 1","Ethernet 2" and so forth.   * Added -swts as a shorter synonym for the -swtimestamps switch.   * Fixed bug with -ptpMasters -noExpired (the -noExpired     option was being ignored when the expiry reason was missed announces).  ---   **5.2.b.20240922** - Optional Upgrade Support for Windows Server 2025.  Symmetric key support for SHA256 and SHA512 for DT2 and NTP protocols. NOTE: Only MD5 and SHA1 are universally supported by NTP appliances. Your NTP time source may or may not support SHA256 or SHA512 hash types.  Added symmetric key type name (MD5, SHA1, etc) to all dropdown lists of key numbers. This is a cosmetic change to help identify the type of key being chosen.   * **DTLinux**   + See the [CHANGELOG.txt](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt) file     for changes specific to DTLinux.* **Control Panel Applet**     + Fixed problem with right-click popup menu       on the time sources list on multi-monitor displays.  ---   **5.2.b.20240425** - Optional Upgrade Minor fixes and enhancements.   * **DTLinux**   + See the [CHANGELOG.txt](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt) file     for changes specific to DTLinux.* **DTServer**     + Fix for PTP master announce stepsRemoved field       when the registry NTP Server Stratum value is non-zero.* **Audit Server**       + Changed display in audit reports from using         scientific notation to decimal representation (only affects very         small values; for example using 0.000050 instead of 5e-5).+ Changed mechanism for obtaining reference time           when using "Use this machine's list of time sources" *and* the           audit machine is a PTP slave, to use the current PTP master's IP,           offset, and stratum instead of querying the list of NTP or DT2           sources. If the audit machine doesn't happen to be a PTP slave, then           the normal use of listed sources operates as before. This change           affects the Audit Server's log file as well as Audit Result reports.* **Manager and Monitor**         + Same change as detailed above for Audit Server in regards to reporting           the source of the reference time.* **Control Panel Applet**           + On the Obtain the Time/Correction Limits page, the Reset to Defaults button             was not resetting the excess latency checkbox or associate value.+ Fixed production of zero-length ptpMasters.txt when the CPL's focus is               set to a remote machine. This only affects generation of file(s) for               inclusion in sending a Problem Report from the Support page.  ---   **5.2.b.20240101** - Optional Upgrade Two minor fixes in DTCheck; one enhancement to Audit Server.   * **DTLinux**   + See the [CHANGELOG.txt](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt) file     for changes specific to DTLinux.* **Audit Server**     + Changed interpretation of Audit Server's       email subject lines (found at HKEY\_LOCAL\_MACHINE\SOFTWARE\Greyware\Domain Time II Audit Server\Logs and Alerts\SMTP)       to allow substitution variables %date% and       %machinename% to be replaced by the current date       and reporting machine (respectively).* **DTCheck**       + Fixed invalid character in the -variance         report output display.+ Changed default Internet leap-seconds.list           source from IETF to IANA (IETF no longer supports the leap           seconds list).  ---   **5.2.b.20230302** - Optional Upgrade Two minor changes to alerting and logging.   * **DTLinux**   + See the [CHANGELOG.txt](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt) file     for changes specific to DTLinux.* **Client/Server Server**     + Fixed sending out "bounds exceeded" SNMP trap       on first correction after startup when the checkbox for ignoring       startup is checked.+ Changed messages about virtualization changes (for         example, live migration) from warning level to information level.  ---   **5.2.b.20221031** - Optional Upgrade One important fix for Audit Server.   * **DTLinux**   + See the [CHANGELOG.txt](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt) file     for changes specific to DTLinux.* **Audit Server**     + Fix for Audit Server's Daily Drift CSV report mistakenly       interpreting DTLinux drift records as milliseconds instead of       nanoseconds.* **Domain Time Server**       + Changed default for new installations of DTServer in slave mode (domain hierarchy) to         not use Windows RID-based authentication.* **Drift Graphs**         + Changed text on drift graph display to say "N/A" instead of "unknown" when the           phase adjustment is either inapplicable to the type of graph, or the value is           zero.  ---   **5.2.b.20220714** - Optional Upgrade Fixed a problem with formatting multiple recipients when sending email to GMail (Google changed its header parsing rules). Enabled support for software RX timestamps on Win11 and Win2022 (Win10 and Win2019 already have support in place). Added Remote Scan feature to DTServer, which can be used by Manager and Audit Server on large segregated networks. Other minor enhancements.   * **DTLinux**   + See the [CHANGELOG.txt](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt) file     for changes specific to DTLinux.* **Manager**     + Added section to the Network Discovery dialog allowing you to       specify Remote Scan options. Remote Scan works by contacting Domain Time Servers       on other networks and having them perform a broadcast/multicast scan on Manager's       behalf. The remote Domain Time Server(s) must be running version 5.2.b.20220414 or       later, and must have Remote Scan enabled. Useful in complex networks where broadcast       and multicast queries cannot reach remote subnets. A Domain Time Server positioned       on the remote subnet can return a list of nodes visible to it.* **Audit Server**       + Audit Server inherits the Remote Scan settings described above.* **DTServer/DTClient**         + Increased number of retries obtaining domain/forest information           to account for lazy network startup in Win10/Win2019 and above.+ Added Remote Scan (DTServer only) functionality. This allows             Manager and Audit Server to gather network information visible to the remote             DTServer. Functionality is disabled by default. To enable, use the Control Panel             applet's Security tab. Click the Commands... button and tick             the box for Remote Scan. This box will only appear on versions             of Domain Time Server 5.2.b.20220414 or later.* **DTCheck**           + Changed -resetserial and -reload             to allow operation via authenticated UDP transaction on Windows machines (instead of stopping and             restarting the service). This capability is already built into DTLinux and DTClient/DTServer,             but dtcheck only used it on Linux nodes.+ Added -remoteScan function (see Manager and DTServer above). This               function lets you test a remote Domain Time Server for compatibility, and shows the               information it would return if used by Manager/Audit Server.+ Enhanced -interfaces command to display the NIC                 internal clock frequency (when available).+ Enhanced -stats2 command to display the type of                   timestamping supported.  ---   **5.2.b.20220322** - Optional Upgrade Minor fixes and enhancements.   * **Miscellaneous**   + Added Windows display version (the same as winver.exe shows)     to logs and startup banners, e.g., *Windows 10 21H1* (display version)     instead of *Windows 10 2009* (actual version number).+ Fixed problem with dialog box upper-left small icon "sticking"       to most recently used icon.* **DTLinux**     + See the [CHANGELOG.txt](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt) file       for changes specific to DTLinux.* **Manager**       + Added update of license files when upgrading a DTLinux client via         "push" update from Manager.* **DTServer/DTClient Control Panel Applet**         + Added support for specifying syslog port number to override the default target port           514/udp. You may add :n, where *n* is the desired port number. For example: 10.1.1.1:777 (IPv4 literal),           [2600:1f18::1]:777 (IPv6 literal -- brackets are required), or mysyslogger.my.org:777 (DNS name). In all of           these examples, syslog output will be sent to port 777.+ Added support for "Do not change audit group"             to the dropdown beside the "Always audit this machine" checkbox. Requires Audit Server 5.2.b.20220111             or later to work properly.* **NTPCheck**           + Added -rtt switch to show originate and terminate timestamps,             and display total round-trip time. Ignored if -raw is not also specified. Ignored             if output is either -json or -csv.* **DTCheck**             + Fixed typo in -help text.+ Eliminated requirement for Remote Registry service for certain                 operations targetting the local machine (specified by providing no target,                 using the machine's NetBIOS name, using the IP 127.0.0.1, or the IP ::1).+ Removed test routines for obsolete bc635/637 PCI clock cards.* **SDK**               + Added atomic copy to GetPTPStats() to prevent rare                 race condition.+ Updated comments inside APITest.cpp to demonstrate how to get                   the full path/filename of the loaded DLL, and how to convert hectonanoseconds to                   either microseconds or milliseconds.  ---   **5.2.b.20210930** - Optional Upgrade Minor fixes and enhancements.   * **DTLinux**   + See the [CHANGELOG.txt](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt) file     for changes specific to DTLinux.* **DTServer/DTClient**     + Customer request: Changed PTP Telecom subscription failure messages from       warning level to debug level as long as at least one of the provisioned masters is responding.       This is a cosmetic change, to keep from filling the log with warnings about Telecom masters       that are offline.* **Control Panel applet**       + Fixed problem with screen lag on Win10 when moving the         Control Panel applet around the screen and system Performance Options ->         "Show window contents while dragging" is checked.+ Fixed misidentification of Domain Time Client as Domain Time Server           when service registry key permissions are locked down too tightly.  ---   **5.2.b.20210630** - Optional Upgrade Support for Windows 11 and Windows Server 2022.  Added support for "short" SHA secrets (SHA1 fewer than 40 hex chars, SHA256 fewer than 64 hex chars, or SHA512 fewer than 128 hex chars). The new minimum length is 20 hex chars (10 bytes), although we recommend that you use the full length for each SHA key type. **Compatibility Note:** If you create "short" SHA secrets and export them to an older version of Domain Time, they won't be recognized as the proper type. Upgrade all of your machines, both DTLinux and Windows, before implementing short SHA secrets.  Added SecureZeroMemory (Windows) and equivalent function (DTLinux) to ensure that symmetric key secrets are erased from memory after use.  Changed group policy handling of secrets to allow "short" SHA keys. To implement, you must add a comment after the secret. For example, if you want an SHA1 secret of 907386b0dd548acaed8b (shorter than the standard 40 hex chars required for SHA1), you would enter it in the policy as "907386b0dd548acaed8b # SHA1" so that Domain Time knows to treat it as SHA1. **Compatibility Note:** You must upgrade any Windows machines using group policy for key distribution before creating any short SHA group policy secrets, or using comments in the group policy settings.   * **Audit Server/Monitor Service**   + Fix for recent change in Microsoft's permissions for the Windows\Temp folder, where these two     services save their SMTP queue files. Upgrade will move the queue folder outside the Windows\Temp     hierarchy, and grant explicit read access to the email.log file in the new folder location.     You can make this change without upgrading by changing the location of the SMTP queue to a folder     on a local drive, and setting the permissions to FULL for SYSTEM and Administrators, and READ for     everyone else.* **Manager**     + Added File -> Upgrade Remote Server & Manager menu item. This new dialog allows you       to upgrade Domain Time Server, Manager, management tools, services and DTLinux files on a remote       machine. This convenience function allows you to upgrade your main Management machine, and then push       that upgrade to any other Manager machines. In the past, you had to run Setup directly on each Manager       machine to upgrade.+ Added check for tombstoned records when you change Active Directory enumeration from         tombstone to purge. If any tombstoned records exist when you make this change, Manager will offer to         delete the tombstoned records.* **DTLinux**       + Several enhancements and fixes; also new security options.         See the [CHANGELOG.txt](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt) file         for changes specific to DTLinux.* **All Components**         + Switched to custom PRNG for determining the pseudo-random sequence ID field of DT2 commands.+ Removed SSL/TLS test on check-for-update functions if the operating system is earlier than             Vista/2008r2. Older operating systems cannot meet the TLS requirements of our website.+ Resized stats structure to include delta values of less than 1 ms. This is the output you see               when issuing dtcheck -stats from the command line. Older versions of both DTLinux and DTWindows will continue               reporting only milliseconds until you upgrade them. All other reporting mechanisms are already in tenths of a               microsecond (Windows) or nanoseconds (Linux).* **DTClient**           + Fixed bug that could make DHCP lookups fail on some operating systems. Also made DHCP lookups more             robust by sending both DHCPDISCOVER and DHCPINFORM messages.* **DTServer**             + Changed DT2 and NTP to support incoming requests signed               with SHA256 or SHA512 keys (as long as the keys exist in your keyring, and are trusted).               Domain Time (as a DT2 or NTP client) is still limited to MD5 and SHA1.* **Control Panel applet**               + Disallowed selection of "Windows Auth" from the authentication drop-down if you have selected                 DT2-HTTP as the protocol. The combination of DT2-HTTP and Windows authentication has never been supported.+ Changed right-click pop-up menu so that it only appears if you right click on a blank area of                   the left-side of the Control Panel applet. Formerly, the menu would pop up no matter where you right-clicked.* **NTPCheck**                 + Allowed NTPCheck to use SHA256 and SHA512 keys as well as MD5 and SHA1. To use any form of                   authentication with NTPCheck, you must run NTPCheck from an elevated command prompt.  ---   **5.2.b.20210331**  - Recommended Upgrade DTLinux is now in production status. Several updates and enhancements to Manger to support DTLinux remotely. Several enhancements to various components and a few minor fixes as detailed below.  Implemented mitigation for a potential security vulnerability in the check-for-upgrade functions of Manager and DTTray. This vulnerability requires DNS hijacking and redirection to a look-alike website, where a fake download could be provided. Credit to GRIMM for alerting us to this potential.   * **Audit Server**   + Fix for raising a Real-Time Alert when the Raise Alert... checkbox is unticked.+ Added StandBy-mode synchronization of Manager's DTLinux and Backup folders.+ Added ability for email subject lines to contain the date/time. Write to techsupport         if you need this feature.* **Manager**     + Added log rolling to Manager's log file; default monthly, keep 12 old logs. Some       customers had set the log max size to zero (unlimited) but had not cleared the log in years, resulting in       multi-GB log files. You may change the settings from Options -> Manager Log File Settings.+ Added ability to remote-upgrade DTLinux installations. You must be running version         5.2.b.20210130 or later on both DTManager and DTLinux. Further, remote-upgrade is disabled by default         in the dtlinux.conf file. You must set dt2Security:managerUpgrade to true before Manager will be         allowed to push the upgrade.+ Added code to close Notepad windows showing temp files when Manager closes.+ Customer request: Added optional startup password for Manager. When set, you must             enter the password before Manager's GUI display appears. You may set, change, or clear the password             from Option -> Set Startup Password.* **DTDrift**       + Changed wording on text rendering of a drift file to say "corrections" instead of         "deltas" in the Clock Corrections section. The Clock Corrections section summarizes corrections (clock deltas         of >= 1ms), so the former wording could be misleading.* **DTLinux**         + Moved DTLinux from beta status to production as of 31 Jan 2021.+ [Read the DTLinux changelog](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/CHANGELOG.txt)             and [the README file](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/README.txt) to see what's new.             Updates to DTLinux do not necessarily coincide with updates to the Windows line of products.* **All Services**           + Increased startup wait-for-IP-addresses time on Win10/Win2019.* **DTServer**             + Fixed bug in stats display that showed HTTP hits by servers and clients in wrong order.+ Added ability for DTServer to function as a DTLinux update source (for use as a local cache                 if your Linux machines don't have Internet access). This option requires installation of Manager to function.+ Deprecated the Domain Role of "Slave Time Server." The option is still available, but admins                   should migrate to Independent Time Server for DCs not holding the PDC-emulator role.+ Fix for DT2-TCP not restarting on IP address change.* **DTClient/DTServer**               + Changed meaning of "TAI-UTC Offset Locked" registry entry to only apply the TAI-UTC offset                 when the PTP master is using the PTP timescale. If the master is using the ARBitrary scale, timestamps are                 presumed to be in UTC already, so no offset from TAI is applicable.+ Eliminated warning message in log about syntax errors or untrusted symmetric keys if the                   timesource is disabled.+ Changed max delay between samples to 1024 milliseconds. It was formerly 16,384 milliseconds.* **Control Panel Applet**                 + Added checkbox to DTServer's Serve the Time page, Serve DTLinux Updates. There is a link                   below the checkbox to test. DT2 over HTTP must be enabled, and Manager must be installed on the same machine                   in order for this function to work.+ Added warning when unchecking a symmetric key (i.e., setting it to untrusted) if any                     timesource, including PTP authentication, is currently using the key number. This is a yes/no dialog box;                     if you select No, then the key will remain checked.+ Changed the list of keys to use for each PTP message type so that only trusted keys are                       displayed. If you have untrusted (or deleted) a key formerly in use for a PTP message, that message's key                       will be set to None.+ Added DTLinux-format file import/export of symmetric keys.+ Added machine import/export from/to DTLinux as well as Windows machines.  ---   **5.2.b.20210103** - Optional Upgrade Removed old programs (NT Alpha, domtimed, WFWG) from all distribution zips. These programs are more than a decade past end-of support.  De-Internationalized day name and month name in the log files, audit reports, and various displays, in favor of yyyy-mm-dd hh:mm:ss or English month and day name abbreviations (depending on the display), for continuity when reading logs or reports created by machines in non-English languages. Retained locale-specific format in several places on the Control Panel applet. Added locale-specific format to the status bar of the log file viewer.  Introduced **Domain Time II for Linux (dtlinux).** This is a full-featured NTP/DT2/PTP client for x86\_64 Linux distros (little-endian Intel or AMD only, running in 64-bit mode). DTLinux may be monitored and audited by Domain Time II Audit Server, and remote-controlled by Domain Time II Manager. **N.B.** DTLinux is still in beta status, but has been tested successfully on CentOS7, CentOS8, RHEL 8.3, Ubuntu 18, Ubuntu 20, Fedora 33, Mint 20, OpenSUSE Tumbleweed, and OracleLinux 8.3. DTLinux is distributed in three packages: DEB for Debian and Debian-derived systems, RPM for RHEL and other RPM-based systems, and a TGZ, which is distro independent. Please visit [DTLinux](/software/domaintime/v5/configuration/dtlinux/) for more information.   * **Manager**   + Fix for refresh of single items on the tree side of the Domains and Workgroups     list. If favorIP was set, the database information would be refreshed, but the display would show     a tombstoned record.+ Added support for the beta DTLinux client. (For security       reasons, remote install/upgrade/remove is not available for Linux.) On Windows 10 or Server 2019,       support for the Microsoft SSH client (you must install SSH from the optional features list).       Support for DTLinux templates, as well as remote configuration, problem report generation, monitoring,       and auditing.* **DTDrift**     + Changed handling of the "SourceStratum" column when using the       -convert -csv option. Prior versions always showed zero (meaning unknown)       in this column, unless the drift files being converted were ones created by Audit Server.       All drift files now contain the source stratum information if available, so DTDrift       will display meaningful information in this column.+ Fixed width of first column when using -convert -csv         without the -localtime option.* **DTLinux**       + Ended private beta. First public release. Domain Time II for Linux (dtlinux)         is documented [here](/software/domaintime/v5/configuration/dtlinux/), and is         included in the Starter Kit and Manager download zips. You may also obtain a copy from         [the direct download folder](/tryout/domtime/dtlinux/).+ **Note:** Although DTLinux is now available to the public, it remains           in beta status. Please test it thoroughly in your test environment before deploying to           production machines.* **Drift Graph**         + Changed textual output from a grapical drift display to include           parenthetical microseconds to help users parse the value in more useful terms.+ Added data point resolution to textual output (either nanoseconds             or 0.1 microseconds, depending on the data source).+ Added StdDev (standard deviation) to textual output.+ Changed display when you click on a dot in the drift graph to display                 *n* nanoseconds, *n* microseconds, *n* milliseconds, or fractional seconds                 (whichever is smallest). This makes something like "+0.000000021 seconds" appear as                 "+21 nanoseconds," which is easier to read.* **DTCheck**           + Changed -ptpStats output to show nanoseconds when operating against             a machine that supports nanos instead of hectos. Also added a parenthetical number of             microseconds to help users parse the values in more useful terms.+ Added support for -resetSerial, -resetTimings, -logFile, and -problemReport               for DTLinux nodes.+ Added metadata to files created using -driftFiles* **DTClient/DTServer**             + Fixed ambiguity in the standard PTP best-master-clock algorithm to               recognize that "better by topology" should be used in master selection as if it were               "better" by other reasons.+ Suppressed error message "Unable to retrieve the time; error 5: No time samples available"                 when you have deliberately removed all external time sources.* **Control Panel Applet**               + Changed "NetBIOS Name" to "NetBIOS/DNS Name" on the stats page. This                 is useful primarily when connecting to a remote machine by IP address. The former behavior                 would display the IP address if the NetBIOS name could not be discovered. The new behavior                 performs a DNS lookup and shows the FQDN if the NetBIOS name is not available.+ Internationalized text on the About page.* **Log file viewer**                 + Removed "Show Line Numbers" from the log file viewer menu.+ Internationalized "Last changed on" line in the status bar. Removed                     internationalization for month and day names within the log contents.* **PTPCheck**                   + Widened main display to give more room for node names and deltas.+ Changed delta and delay displays from hectonanoseconds (1e-7) to                       nanoseconds (1e-9) on main display to accommodate DTLinux, which reports nanoseconds. Replies                       from Windows machines will show all 9 digits, but the last two will always be 00,                       because Windows can only report 7 significant digits. Changed details display to say                       *n* nanoseconds, microseconds, milliseconds, or seconds, with appropriate number of                       significant digits.  ---   **5.2.b.20200930** - Optional Upgrade Many improvements for isolated networks that want to use PTP only (i.e., no NTP or DT2 fallback or crosscheck support). The Accept First PTP Timestamp option is now more robust, and, upon discovering a large divergence during normal operations, you may choose to allow the machine to step the clock using only PTP sources. A PTP-only configuration is sub-optimal, and our recommendation remains for you to make at least one NTP or DT2 time source available for startup, fallback, and crosscheck. Several small fixes and improvements. Upgrade if you are affected by any of the changes in the list.  * **Audit Server/Manager**   + Improved Manager's ability to manage time zones on remote machines using a different     national language edition of Windows (for example, managing a Japanese-language machine from a EN-US-language     machine, or vice versa).+ Fixed bug in Audit Server that sometimes prevented Manager's Real-Time Alerts display       from showing current PTP status for machines. This problem only occurred when Real-Time Alerts were received       during an upgrade of the management tools.* **DTServer**     + Changed the logic when using DTServer as a PTP master, but the admin has selected "Do not       set this machine's time," to allow PTP to send Announce messages using the values set by the admin. The former       behavior was to send Announces showing the time as degraded. This change helps in closed environments where       the admin wants all machines synchronized to the master, but has deliberately chosen to have the master itself       unsynchronized.+ Improved calculation of residence time as expressed in the correction fields of Peer-to-Peer         delay responses.* **DTClient/DTServer**       + Fix for setting time zone, either by push from Manager, or pull from DTServer by DTClient,         so that invalid entries generate an error instead of leaving the machine in a potentially inconsistent state.         Invalid entries are those whose Standard name doesn't match the registry key name, or those that exist on         the timezone source but not the consumer.+ Changed log message about PTP with no backup sources from warning to status/info level+ Changed log message about PTP running but no samples yet from warning to status/info level+ Added logic to detect egregious PTP delay measurement results arising from use               of the canonical algorithms specified in IEEE 1588. This situation obtains primarily when the master and slave               differ significantly in frequency or time of day. If the actual measured round-trip time is less than the               algorithm-produced time, then the meanPathDelay will derive from the actual round-trip time.+ Added registry DWORD setting Accept First PTP Sample Count to the Parameters                 section. The default value is 3, and the range allowed is 1-15. Prior versions only examined the very first                 PTP time sample when accepting the first PTP timestamp.+ Changed behavior of Accept First PTP Timestamp to slew when within slewing bounds. This                   function will step the clock if the delta is large, so continue to use it with care.+ Changed behavior of Accept First PTP Timestamp to re-arm upon detection of resume-from-standby,                     emerge-from-sleep, or a Clock Change Monitor trigger.+ Exposed the Accept First PTP Timestamp option on the Control Panel applet, eliminating the need                       for editing the registry manually. Note that you must either stop/start the service, or reboot the machine, in order                       for the first PTP timestamp to be accepted.+ Added support for resetting duplicate serial numbers by command from DTManager or DTCheck. This                         avoids the need to stop/restart the service on the machine whose serial number needs to be reset.* **Control Panel Applet**         + Fixed display glitch on Control Panel applet when moving entries up or down (reordering) in           a list of time sources. The resultant data was correct, but the display did not update the last field in the           list.+ Fix to prevent dragging the Control Panel applet completely off-screen.+ Added new entry, "Upon PTP large divergence," to list of conditions that allow stepping. This               is primarily useful for machines using only PTP without fallback NTP/DT2 time sources, and where the correction               needed is too large to accomplish by slewing. This option is disabled by default. NOTE: This setting does not               apply when using the Accept First PTP Timestamp option. Accept First PTP Timestamp will *always* step if               slewing is not possible.   ---   **5.2.b.20200630** - Optional Upgrade Several minor changes, mostly at customer request. Upgrade if you are experiencing any of the bugs described, or if you need the newer functionality.  * **Manager**   + Changed behavior of Manager's command-line IMPORT ADD function to set nodes to audited     whether or not they previously existed in the database. This conforms with the documentation, and makes     ADD the opposite of DROP (except that ADD will add nodes to the database if they don't already exist).+ Added 0 (zero) to the list of audit groups that may be specified after the machine name/IP address       of Manager's command-line IMPORT ADD function. Formerly, only 1-8 were supported, corresponding to Audit       Group number 1-8. If you specify 0 instead of 1-8, then the node will be added but set to unaudited.       This is essentially the same as DROP, except that the node will be added to the database if it doesn't       already exist.* **DTClient**     + Added IP address of responding DHCP server to debug mode log output, if DTClient is set       to use DHCP as one of its auto-discovery options.+ Added REG\_DWORD "DHCP Sample Count" to the Time Sources subkey. If DTClient is set to use         DHCP as one of its auto-discovery options, this value controls how many samples Domain Time should request         from each configured server. The valid range is 1-5. Changes to this registry setting take effect at the         next timecheck interval. You do not need to stop/start the service, or reload other parameters.+ Added REG\_DWORD "DHCP Sample Pause (ms)" to the Time Sources subkey. The valid range is           16-1024. This value controls how many milliseconds Domain Time pauses between samples of DHCP-discovered sources if           the DHCP Sample Count value is greater than 1. The default is 512.+ Rearranged logic when DTClient is using DHCP as one of its auto-discovery options. As of             this version, if DHCP is selected, and the DHCP server responds with a list of one or more IPs, and if one             or more of those IPs provides a valid time sample when queried, DTClient will skip any non-DHCP discovered             time sources after that. If the use-last-known-good option is selected, DHCP-discovered servers will remain in the             last-known-good list, but used only if subsequent DHCP queries fail. If the DHCP-discovered sources fail, or             the DHCP server fails to provide a list, Domain Time will use the other configured discovery options as fallback             sources.* **DTClient/DTServer**       + Improved performance when using the special [Accept First PTP Timestamp](/software/domaintime/v5/configuration/server/registry.asp#acceptptp) registry setting. This option         should only be used in closed environments where PTP is the only possible source of time and the initial startup         delta takes an excessively long time to correct (i.e. if the motherboard CMOS clock is wrong). If no other time         sources are configured, PTP will **step** the clock to match the first incoming PTP sync timestamp. This         initial stepping will bring the clock into close enough sync for normal PTP operations to govern the clock.         It is no longer necessary to also untick the "Crosscheck with other sources" checkbox.* **DTLockDn**         + Implemented workaround for dtlockdn /reset being unable to set registry key ownership           on Windows Server 2012r2 and Windows Server 2016. These two versions of the operating system have slightly           different requirements than earlier or later operating systems. If the workaround is invoked due to           2012r2/2016 restrictions, a warning message will appear in the output, and DTLockDn will continue if the           workaround is successful.+ DTLockDn will no longer add read permissions for the well-known SIDs "Authenticated Users",             "Users", or "Everyone" if you have explicitly /revoked or set them to READ or FULL. Otherwise, DTLockDn will             add READ for Authenticated Users (if valid for your operating system), Users (if Authenticated Users is not             valid or already present) or Everyone (if neither Authenticated Users nor Users is present and valid).+ Note that, on startup, Domain Time will always reset the permissions on the Keyring subkey so that access is               limited to SYSTEM and Administrators.  ---   **5.2.b.20200331** - Optional Upgrade Several minor enhancements, including better performance using PTP with sync rates of less than one per second. You should upgrade if your PTP master sends fewer than one sync packet per second.  * **Manager**   + Added dialog Options -> Network Options -> Name Resolution to let you choose how Manager     resolves names when connecting to remote Domain Time machines. By default, Manager and Audit Server first try the FQDN     (fully-qualified domain name), which is created by concatenating the Common Name (NetBIOS name) with the domain name.     You may change the name resolution method to either Common Name (NetBIOS name), or to DNS name.+ Added option to specify an Audit Group number (1-8, inclusive) to Manager's command-line IMPORT function.       If no Audit Group is specified, Manager uses the default Audit Group for new nodes. For example, if your batch import file       contains Add NTP myntpappliance 3 then the NTP server called myntpappliance will be added to the NTP       list and placed in Audit Group 3.+ Changed prompt on connection failure dialog from "Always use this name for locating this machine" to         "Always use this IP Address to locate this machine." The checkbox will be grayed-out if you enter anything but a valid         IPv4 or IPv6 address. This change reduces confusion by making the action of the dialog box match the internal workings         of Manager.* **DTServer/DTClient**     + Fix for "TAI-UTC Offset Locked" registry variable not being recognized when acquiring a new master.+ Improved synchronization performance when PTP master is sending packets less often than once a second.+ Change PTP sync timeout to be twice the sync interval plus 1. This helps on networks that drop packets.+ Increased depth of lookback buffer for UDP packet de-duplication. This helps on networks subject to UDP flooding.* **DTCheck**       + Added -ptptest -showsequence subtest. This test watches for Announces         and Syncs from grandmasters and displays drops, repeats, and jumps in PTP message sequence numbers.+ Fix for -swTimestamps returning faux error code when operating on remote machines.  ---   **5.2.b.20200101** - Optional Upgrade Two minor fixes, several changes based on customer requests, enhanced PTP behavior with multiple Syncs per second. Upgrade if you want the new functionality.  * **Audit Server**   + Changed validation range for PTP Monitor's Sync message intervals to allow for     more than one sync/second. This only affects the displayed values in Manager.* **Manager**     + Changed default remote connection procedure to try the FQDN (if available) before       falling back to the NetBIOS name or IP address. Note that if you double-click a node's DNS Name, Manager       will try the DNS name first. Likewise, if you double-click a node's IP address, Manager will try the       IP address first. This change only affects how Manager behaves when you double-click a node's NetBIOS       name (the Common Name).+ Allowed Manager's list display of node timezones to include non-English languages.+ Added extra debug logging for errors/problems during LDAP machine enumeration. Also           added workaround code to retry LDAP queries that return "success" with zero entries. This situation only           occurs in very large domains with overburdened Domain Controllers.+ Added registry parameter, "ICMP Required" (default true). You may set this to the English             word "False" to skip ICMP tests during connection. Some networks disallow ICMP echo requests. Note that setting             this to false may cause long timeouts or unexpected errors for machines that are offline or otherwise unreachable.* **DTServer/DTClient**       + Changed critical section envelope when handling PTP delay measurement replies. This prevents         erroneous results when a boundary clock or grandmaster sends two replies to a single request.+ Fixed typo in timezone display calculation that could produce UTC - offset instead           of UTC + offset. This error only affected the display of parenthetical UTC offset information shown           after the timezone name.+ Fixed typo in PTP code that assigns significance values based on operating system level (only             affects not-yet-released versions of Windows).+ Improved handling of more than one PTP sync per second.+ Added NTP precision to startup log debug output.+ Added checkbox to allow stepping the clock upon an IP change trigger. Unchecked by default.+ Allowed Domain Time Server in the PTP multicast master role to send up to 64 sync packets/second.                     This is solely for compatibility with SMTPE or 802.1AS slaves that mistakenly require a higher frequency of syncs.                     In general, avoid setting the rate greater than one per second unless required by your slaves.+ Changed Realtime Alert sending to use a queue and a low-priority persistent background thread.                       This allows for multiple tries to send the data if the receiving server happens to be temporarily unavailable.                       Added extra debugging (under "Uncategorized debug messages") to show retries and overall queue functioning.* **DTCheck**         Fix to allow -firewall:open and -firewall:close to work on Server 2019. This only affects DTCheck.         The code to automatically handle the firewall built into Server, Client, and Audit Server already works correctly.  ---   [Next Proceed to the **Older v5.2 history** page](v52.asp)  [Next Proceed to the **Planning** page](planning.asp)[Back Back to the **Requirements** page](requirements.asp) |

# Introduction

## Cleaning your domain clock

Sometimes we grow to like the old software we’ve become familiar with over the years, but because as users we only see the facade of an interface and functionality, we don’t know what risks may exist in something as simple as a clock. The bar is high for enterprise software: we have to expect that our software accomplishes all of its tasks in a manner that doesn’t put us at risk. Today we dive into a venerable piece of software that appears to carry out its underappreciated task, because despite the engineering behind its functionality, it contained a classic software flaw.

Domain Time II from Greyware Automation Products, Inc. is enterprise-grade time synchronization software, including client and server software as well as testing, administration, and auditing capabilities. Everyone has probably had a moment when they realized that the clocks on two different devices were off by a few minutes (or more), but some businesses are particularly sensitive to this issue and need to ensure that their computer systems are as closely synchronized as possible.

While this might seem like a boring problem, it actually requires a fair bit of work to keep computers’ clocks in sync; so much so that it’s a [well-known issue](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Clock_synchronization) in computing with a number of protocols and approaches for solving it to different precisions. In addition to implementing some of the more well known protocols such as NTP, Domain Time II implements its own high-precision protocol that can provide a tiered approach to serving time with clients and a hierarchy of servers.

All of this organization is very convenient, but it does require administering and trusting the software that runs on all the clients and servers you want synchronized. The difficulty with trust and software is that the authors have to get things right all the time, as well as be familiar with the tactics an attacker would use. Otherwise they end up in a situation like we found, where a weakness was obviously visible if one knew where to look... This time it’s an area that is overlooked by many, but rarely ignored by attackers: the update process. Most people know that updates are important for security, but typically only attackers and experts bother to look at the security of an update process itself and understand what a motivated attacker could do.

If you’ve never heard of a Man-on-the-Side (MotS) attack, it’s really just a variant of the classic Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack, where the attacker can inspect and control the communication flowing between two parties. In a MotS, the attacker can inspect but not control the data, though they may be able to respond to traffic they see. This attack is more easily achieved than a full MitM (think of any time you get on unencrypted WiFi, for example), but is also usually easily foiled by the use of encryption by the participants. Concerns over these kinds of attacks have led to the widespread adoption of Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTPS) and Transport Layer Security (TLS). Without such encryption, any communication that can be eavesdropped at any point along the path of network communication could potentially be vulnerable, especially connectionless User Datagram Protocol (UDP) traffic like that used in the upgrade process for Domain Time II.

# Bug identification

## Domain Time II upgrade attack

* Vulnerability Type: Unauthenticated Upgrade Process
* Location: dttray.exe
* Affected Versions: Domain Time II versions 5.2.x (current releases), 5.1.x (starting from 2010), and 4.1.x (starting from 2007) from 5.2.b.20210103 to at least 4.1.b.20070308
* Impact: Potential Download and Execution of Malicious Payloads
* CVE Number: TBD

The Domain Time II Client and Server programs both use the same executable, `dttray.exe`, to check for updates. Neither program automatically checks for updates by default, but both can be set to check for updates on startup or can be instructed to check for an update manually. Additionally, the Domain Time II Update Server component, if installed, does automatically check for updates whenever the Domain Time II Manager is opened.

| --- |
| Figure 1: Disassembly of client processing upgrade response |

In all update cases, `dttray.exe` will send a UDP query to the update server to see if an update is available. If the server responds with a Uniform Resource Locator (URL) (i.e. it begins with “http://” or “https://”), the software will open a dialog box notifying a user that an update is available. If the user accepts the dialog, the software calls `ShellExecuteA` with the "open" argument on the URL returned by the server. This causes a browser window to open and navigate to the provided URL of the update webpage, which instructs the user to download and apply an update patch executable. The disassembly for this process can be seen in Figure 1, and the web page displayed to registered users can be seen in Figure 2. The web page for evaluation software users is similar except it doesn’t ask for email and password information.

If an attacker is able to intercept the initial UDP query and send back their own URL, then the user in the above scenario would be prompted to download and execute an attacker-controlled payload. Any executable downloaded and run in this way would execute with user privileges, though it could request elevation of privileges the same way the legitimate installer does.

# Technical analysis

Observing the weakness in the update protocol is straightforward. By viewing the traffic generated during the update check in a tool like Wireshark, we can see two UDP packets originating from the user software: one Domain Name System (DNS) query, and one packet sent to the IP resolved from the DNS query to UDP port 9909.

| [Client upgrade request packet contents](https://d1ittcfw0x896z.cloudfront.net/06-apr-21/3.jpg) |
| --- |
| Figure 3: Client upgrade request packet contents |

The upgrade request packet contains the client’s version string in ASCII in plaintext as shown in Figure 3.

| --- |
| Figure 4: Update server response to up-to-date clients |

Figure 4 shows a normal response from the update server contains only the plaintext phrase “CURRENT”, demonstrating there was no encryption or authentication used.

## Exploit

In order to demonstrate the weakness in this process, the [provided script](https://github.com/grimm-co/NotQuite0DayFriday/tree/trunk/2021.04.06-domain-time-2), `upgrade_attack.py`, listens on the provided network interface for upgrade traffic and responds to the appropriate DNS and Domain Time II requests. Additionally, the Proof of Concept (PoC) has an Hypertext Transfer Protocol (HTTP) impersonation mode (see `--help`). In this mode, the PoC will respond to HTTP requests as well, and direct users to a look-alike web server with the correct URL but over HTTP instead of HTTPS. When run outside of the HTTP impersonation mode, the PoC will send users directly to the IP of the web server. The script’s functionality can be summarized in how it deals with each of these three protocols:

1. Listens for and responds to DNS requests for update.greyware.com
2. Listens for and responds to unencrypted Domain Time II version check packets, providing a URL that the target will open via HTTP
3. Serves a lookalike update webpage over HTTP as well as a demonstration executable for users to download and run

The result is an attack that mirrors the appearance of the legitimate update mechanism in order to increase its believability (see Figure 5).

| [Greyware’s official update website (left) and the demonstration attack website (right)](https://d1ittcfw0x896z.cloudfront.net/06-apr-21/5.jpg) |
| --- |
| Figure 5: Greyware’s official update website (left) and the demonstration attack website (right) |

The PoC itself was tested and verified to work against versions `4.1.b.20070308`, `5.1.b.20100731`, and `5.2.b.20210103` of Domain Time II.

## Testing

To test the provided PoC, the easiest setup is to create a 64-bit Windows 10 Virtual Machine (VM) and install the evaluation version of Domain Time II (available here: <https://www.greyware.com/software/domaintime/>). Since both the client and server are vulnerable, you can choose to install either one. To simplify the setup, set the network adapter of the VM to NAT.

Once installed, return to your host and run the `upgrade_attack.py` script. You will need to provide the IP of your host (as visible to the client VM) and the name of the interface shared between the host and the guest VM. In our demonstration using VMWare, this is “vmnet8”.

```
  python3 upgrade_attack.py vmnet8 XXX.XXX.XXX.XXX
```

Depending on your host configuration, you may need to run this script with root privileges. Once the script starts sniffing the specified interface for the target DNS request, trigger the update process from within the guest VM. In the Windows system tray (bottom right of the screen), right click the `dttray.exe` icon, select “Setup” then “Check for newer version now...” This will trigger the update process and start the MotS race. If the attack server wins the race, the following messages will appear in the console output of `upgrade_attack.py`:

```
  DNS Query for "update.greyware.com." from <Guest VM IP>
  [+] Target DNS Query responded to with <Host IP>
  DNS Response for "update.greyware.com." from <Attack Server>
  DT2 from <Guest VM IP>:60605 to <Host IP>:9909
  [+] Responded to target DT2 Update request: <Payload>
  DT2 from <Host IP>:9909 to <Guest VM IP>:60605
```

These messages indicate that the attack server sniffed the DNS request for the legitimate upgrade server, responded with its own IP, then responded to the upgrade request with its own payload. In this case, the payload is a fake website that mimics a legitimate Greyware Automation Products page. At the bottom of the page is a link to “Get the patch!” Clicking this link prompts the user to download a payload (`calc.exe`) and execute it as the current user.

We’ve chosen opening the calculator application as an easily-observed payload action, but the attack server is set up to transparently serve the attacker’s chosen executable while showing the user the executable name they requested (typically `dtpatch.exe`). The included demonstration payload illustrates what warnings the user would experience in an attack that isn’t trying to evade antivirus, but for testing purposes the payload could be replaced with Microsoft’s signed `calc.exe` or a penetration testing tool. Such testing will show the impact in payload choice on what the victim would see.

Victim's Perspective when running the PoC

Since the MotS vulnerability exploited by this PoC is a race (between the attack server and the legitimate DNS server), the PoC is not guaranteed to succeed every time. Additionally, the use of the HTTP impersonation mode introduces a second race that must be won for the PoC to be successful. If an attacker can achieve a MitM scenario on the traffic, they can ensure they always win the race by blocking either traffic to/from the Internet side. For testing purposes, we recommend simulating that scenario by disabling your host’s access to the internet and not running in HTTP impersonation mode.

# Impact

The expected deployment scenario for this software is that the Domain Time II Server is installed on the Domain Controller within an Active Directory forest, and that the Update Server component would be run from such a machine (see “admin.txt” in the Domain Time II install bundle).

As such, the impact of successfully executing a MotS attack against a server would be to execute malware with administrative privileges in the context of the server. Since the Domain Time II server can track and update versions of the client software across the network, compromising the server could lead to attackers being able to spread laterally across a network to workstations, database servers, or source code repositories. All this could be performed under the guise of legitimate administration tasks of recognized software, similar to how some recent intrusions hid their activity on a network under the guise of Solar Winds software activity.

It is also possible that any user running the client software could infect themselves with malware, regardless of whether they are in a standalone client or domain setting, though in a domain setting the malware may be limited to domain user permissions.

## Affected software

Since Domain Time II is closed-source software, it is difficult to generate an exact list of impacted versions. GRIMM was able to obtain evaluation copies of the following three versions of Domain Time II: `5.2.b.20210103`, `5.1.b.20100731` (released in 2010), and `4.1.b.20070308` (released in 2007). Through static analysis of the software installed by these installers, GRIMM was able to confirm that the vulnerability exists in all three versions of Domain Time II. As such, it is reasonable to believe that the vulnerability affects all versions of Domain Time II released after `4.1.b20070308`. It is possible that the vulnerability exists prior to this version, but GRIMM was unable to source earlier versions of the software. A fix for this vulnerability was released in version `5.2.b.20210331.`

# Conclusions

This blog post details a MotS attack that allows attackers to potentially gain code execution on machines running versions of Domain Time II that date back at least ten years. The crux of this vulnerability lies in the lack of authentication between Domain Time II servers and clients, and external Greyware update servers. If an attacker is able to detect outgoing update requests and respond to them before the legitimate Greyware servers do, then said attacker can direct users to download executable code from attacker-controlled servers. A combination of privilege reduction (e.g. only allowing Domain Time II servers to call out for external updates) and better user training (e.g. create documentation on secure update procedures) poses significant mitigation to this, and similar, vulnerabilities.

# GRIMM’s Private Vulnerability Disclosure (PVD) Program

GRIMM’s Private Vulnerability Disclosure (PVD) program is a subscription-based vulnerability intelligence feed. This high-impact feed serves as a direct pipeline from GRIMM’s vulnerability researchers to its subscribers, facilitating the delivery of actionable intelligence on 0-day threats as they are discovered by GRIMM. We created the PVD program to allow defenders to get ahead of the curve, rather than always having to react to events outside of their control.

The goal of this program is to provide value to subscribers in the following forms:

* Advanced notice (at least two weeks) of 0-days prior to public disclosure. This affords subscribers time to get mitigations in place before the information is publicly available.
* In-depth, technical documentation of each vulnerability.
* PoC vulnerability exploitation code for:

  + Verifying specific configurations are vulnerable
  + Testing defenses to determine their effectiveness in practice
  + Training

    - Blue teams on writing robust mitigations and detections
    - Red teams on the art of exploitation
* A list of any indicators of compromise
* A list of actionable mitigations that can be put in place to reduce the risk associated with each vulnerability.

The research is done entirely by GRIMM, and the software and hardware selected by us is based on extensive threat modeling and our team’s deep background in reverse engineering and vulnerability research. Requests to look into specific software or hardware are welcome, however we can not guarantee the priority of such requests. In addition to publishing our research to subscribers, GRIMM also privately discloses each vulnerability to its corresponding vendor(s) in an effort to help patch the underlying issues.

If interested in getting more information about the PVD program, reach out to us.

  Introduction Dusting off a few new (old) vulns Have you ever been casually perusing the source code of the Linux kernel and thought to yourself "Wait a minute, that can’t be right"? That’s the position we found ourselves in when we found three bugs in a forgotten corner of the mainline Linux kernel that turned out to be about 15 years old. Unlike most things that we find gathering dust, these bugs turned out to still be good, and one turned out to be useable as a Local Privilege Escalation (LPE) in multiple Linux environments. Who you calling SCSI? The particular subsystem in question is the SCSI (Small Computer System Interface) data transport, which is a standard for transferring data made for connecting computers with peripheral devices, originally via a physical cable, like hard drives. SCSI is a venerable standard originally published in 1986 and was the go-to for server setups, and iSCSI is basically SCSI over TCP. SCSI is still in use today, especially...

At GRIMM, we do a lot of vulnerability and binary analysis research. As such, we often seek to automate some of the analysis steps and ease the burden on the individual researcher. One task which can be very mundane and time consuming for certain types of programs (C++, firmware, etc), is identifying structures' fields and applying the structure types to the corresponding functions within the decompiler. Thus, this summer we gave one of our interns,  Alex Lin , the task of developing a Ghidra plugin to automatically identify a binary's structs and mark up the decompilation accordingly. Alex's writeup below describes the results of the project, GEARSHIFT, which automates struct identification of function parameters by symbolically interpreting Ghidra's P-Code to determine how each parameter is accessed. The Ghidra plugin described in this blog can be found in our GEARSHIFT repository . Background Ghidra is a binary reverse engineering tool developed by the National Sec...

Netgear R7000 SOHO Device Exploitation After a long day of hard research, it’s fun to relax, kick back, and do something easy. While modern software development processes have vastly improved the quality of commercial software as compared to 10-15 years ago, consumer network devices have largely been left behind. Thus, when it’s time for some quick fun and a nice confidence boost, I like to analyze Small Office/Home Office (SOHO) devices. This blog describes one such session of auditing the Netgear R7000 router , analyzing the resulting vulnerability, and the exploit development process that followed. The write-up and code for the vulnerability described in this blog post can be found in our NotQuite0DayFriday repository. Initial Analysis The first step when analyzing a SOHO device is to obtain the firmware. Thankfully, Netgear’s support website hosts all of the firmwares for the R7000. The Netgear R7000 version 1.0.9.88 firmware used in this blog post can be downloaded from this web...
