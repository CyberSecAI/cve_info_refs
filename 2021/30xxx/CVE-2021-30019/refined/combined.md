### **[treebacker](/treebacker)** commented [Mar 29, 2021](#issue-843060662)

| In `filters/reframe_adts.c`, function `adts_dmx_process`. There is a sub codes like as below: ` size = ctx->hdr.frame\_size - ctx->hdr.hdr\_size; offset = ctx->hdr.hdr\_size; ...... memcpy(output, sync + offset, size);  ` However, with crafted file, ctx->hdr.frame\_size may be smaller than ctx->hdr.hdr\_size. So, the size may be a negative number, which results a heap overflow in memcpy.  In Command line: gpac -info bug6 [bug6_cmd](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44844446/112800680-8d05c780-90a2-11eb-8b87-557d15fc11b4.png)  In gdb: [bug6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/44844446/112800687-8f682180-90a2-11eb-964a-1ace9cba1bff.png)  The crafted file is in the attached zip: [bug6.zip](https://github.com/gpac/gpac/files/6219966/bug6.zip) |
