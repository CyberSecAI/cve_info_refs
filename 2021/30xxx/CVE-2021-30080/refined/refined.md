Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30080:

**CVE-2021-30080**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an issue in the route lookup process within the Beego framework. Specifically, the way Beego handled route matching allowed attackers to bypass access controls.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Access Control Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to circumvent intended access restrictions due to a flaw in how routes are resolved.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows attackers to bypass access control mechanisms, potentially granting unauthorized access to sensitive resources or functionalities.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through manipulating the request path in a way that bypasses the intended route matching logic.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a Beego application.
    *   No specific user interaction or privilege is needed.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Beego versions 1.12.11 and earlier, as well as in v2 before version 2.0.3
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.0.3 of Beego v2.
*   The vulnerability is related to a commit `d5df5e4` which modified `server/web/tree.go` and `server/web/tree_test.go`. The fix involves ensuring that extensions are correctly handled during routing to avoid cases like `/aaa.html/bbb` matching `/aaa/bbb`.

The provided content also references a related vulnerability, CVE-2022-31836, which is a path traversal vulnerability also affecting beego. This is addressed in later versions and has a different root cause.
