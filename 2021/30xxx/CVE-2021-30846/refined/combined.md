CVE-2021-30851 seems to be REJECTED (cf.
<https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-30851>). Is
there a typo in the CVE id for this one or did the CVE got rejected
later on? The CVE entry only states "Reason: This candidate was
withdrawn by the CVE program." so might give a light indication
towards that the CVE used has a typo and should be another one?

Can you clarify or have any insights here?

Regards,
Salvatore

BCC'ing Samuel Groß

Salvatore -
  I think 30851 was not issued, and it may have been a mistake here.
There was no other CVE issued as part of WSA-2021-0006 according to
the GitHub repo for the CVE program:
<https://github.com/CVEProject/cvelist/search?q=wsa-2021-0006>

if you need a CVE for this, Samuel may be able to sort this out with
the WebKit folks, who also seem to advertise 30851 on their security
advisory site: <https://webkitgtk.org/security/WSA-2021-0006.html>

Have a good Wednesday,

Package        : wpewebkit
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-30846 CVE-2021-30851 CVE-2021-42762

The following vulnerabilities have been discovered in the wpewebkit
web engine:

CVE-2021-30846

    Sergei Glazunov discovered that processing maliciously crafted web
    content may lead to arbitrary code execution

CVE-2021-30851

    Samuel Gross discovered that processing maliciously crafted web
    content may lead to code execution

CVE-2021-42762

    An anonymous reporter discovered a limited Bubblewrap sandbox
    bypass that allows a sandboxed process to trick host processes
    into thinking the sandboxed process is not confined.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.34.1-1~deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wpewebkit packages.

For the detailed security status of wpewebkit please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wpewebkit>

Hi!

I don't know what happened to CVE-2021-30851 as these CVEs are allocated by
Apple usually. I think the CVE would correspond to this issue though:
<https://bugs.webkit.org/show_bug.cgi?id=227988>

Best!
Samuel

WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit Security Advisory                 WSA-2021-0006

WebKitGTK Advisory URL  : <https://webkitgtk.org/security/WSA-2021-0006.html>
WPE WebKit Advisory URL : <https://wpewebkit.org/security/WSA-2021-0006.html>

                          CVE-2021-30858, CVE-2021-42762.

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit.

CVE-2021-30846
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.0.
    Credit to Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero.
    Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to
    arbitrary code execution. Description: A memory corruption issue was
    addressed with improved memory handling.

CVE-2021-30848
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.32.4.
    Credit to Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero.
    Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to code
    execution. Description: A memory corruption issue was addressed with
    improved memory handling.

CVE-2021-30849
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.32.4.
    Credit to Sergei Glazunov of Google Project Zero.
    Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to
    arbitrary code execution. Description: Multiple memory corruption
    issues were addressed with improved memory handling.

CVE-2021-30851
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.0.
    Credit to Samuel Groß of Google Project Zero.
    Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to code
    execution. Description: A memory corruption vulnerability was
    addressed with improved locking.

CVE-2021-30858
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.32.4.
    Credit to an anonymous researcher.
    Impact: Processing maliciously crafted web content may lead to
    arbitrary code execution. Apple is aware of a report that this issue
    may have been actively exploited. Description: A use after free
    issue was addressed with improved memory management.

CVE-2021-42762
    Versions affected: WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit before 2.34.1.
    Credit to an anonymous reporter.
    BubblewrapLauncher.cpp allows a limited sandbox bypass that allows a
    sandboxed process to trick host processes into thinking the
    sandboxed process is not confined by the sandbox, by abusing VFS
    syscalls that manipulate its filesystem namespace. The impact is
    limited to host services that create UNIX sockets that WebKit mounts
    inside its sandbox, and the sandboxed process remains otherwise
    confined. NOTE: this is similar to CVE-2021-41133.

We recommend updating to the latest stable versions of WebKitGTK and WPE
WebKit. It is the best way to ensure that you are running safe versions
of WebKit. Please check our websites for information about the latest
stable releases.

Further information about WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit security advisories
can be found at: <https://webkitgtk.org/security.html> or
