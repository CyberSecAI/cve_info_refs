- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in the web management consoles of Symantec Advanced Secure Gateway (ASG) and ProxySG. This vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to bypass user authentication by sending specially crafted HTTP/HTTPS requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass. The web management console does not properly authenticate users, allowing unauthenticated access.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Execution of arbitrary CLI commands through the web management console, including enable or configuration mode.
    - Ability to view and modify the appliance configuration and policy.
    - Capability to shutdown or restart the appliance.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending crafted HTTP/HTTPS requests to the web management console.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the web management console of the affected devices (ASG and ProxySG). The attacker does not need prior authentication to the system.
