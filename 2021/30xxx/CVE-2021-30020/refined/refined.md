Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A heap overflow vulnerability exists in the `gf_hevc_read_pps_bs_internal` function within `media_tools/av_parsers.c`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The code reads `pps->num_tile_columns` from the bitstream.
- It then uses this value in a loop that writes to `pps->column_width`, without proper bounds checking.
- If a crafted bitstream provides a value for `pps->num_tile_columns` that is larger than the allocated size of `pps->column_width`, a heap overflow occurs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A heap overflow can lead to memory corruption.
- This can cause a crash of the application.
- In some cases, it could lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted HEVC bitstream.
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious file with a large `num_tile_columns` value.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted bitstream to the vulnerable application (GPAC).
- No special privileges or specific network positions are required, it is sufficient to have the application parse the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content includes a patch for this vulnerability, which adds boundary checks to the SPS, PPS, and VPS ID values.
- The commit `51cdb67ff7c5f1242ac58c5aa603ceaf1793b788` addresses this issue by adding safety checks for IDs used when reading the bitstream, including `sps_id`, `pps_id`, and `vps_id`. Specifically the patch adds checks to ensure that they are not negative or exceed the maximum allowed values, therefore preventing the heap overflow.
