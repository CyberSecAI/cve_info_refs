Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30169:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the storage of user credentials in HTML format (`/new/setup.htm`) with base64 encoding, making them easily retrievable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Credentials:** Usernames and passwords are not securely stored, as they are just base64 encoded in the HTML source of `/new/setup.htm`.
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information (user credentials) is disclosed via a web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can retrieve the base64 encoded admin credentials. These can then be decoded, potentially leading to unauthorized access and control of the affected IP camera.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** Attackers can exploit this remotely if they have network access to the device's web interface.
- **Direct Access to Web Page:** If an attacker is able to access the `/new/setup.htm` on the device they can retrieve the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Accessibility:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the IP camera or have network access to it.
- **HTTP Access:**  The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device, specifically to the vulnerable page `/new/setup.htm`.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is pre-authentication, so no prior authentication is needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Medium" severity with a CVSSv3.1 score of 5.3 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).
- This vulnerability is related to LILIN IP Camera P2 and Z2 series with firmware versions 7.1.94.8908 or lower.
- The vulnerability is distinct from the other vulnerabilities affecting the same devices, such as command injection and broken access control, which have been assigned other CVE IDs (CVE-2021-30166, CVE-2021-30167, CVE-2021-30168).
