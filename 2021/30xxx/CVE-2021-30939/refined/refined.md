Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-30939:

**Root Cause:**
- An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists within the ImageIO framework when parsing specially crafted DirectDraw Surface (DDS) texture image files. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs in the `BCReadPlugin::decodeDXTCtoRGBX` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of the memory address where the image decoding should start. The code adds a fixed offset (0x80) to the beginning of the file data, effectively shifting the read pointer beyond the bounds of the allocated buffer when the file size is smaller.
- **Insufficient Size Checks:** The code validates the file size against expected image dimensions but fails to account for the fixed header size (0x80 bytes) before calculating memory addresses, leading to the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The out-of-bounds read can expose sensitive memory contents, potentially revealing heap addresses or other information.
- **Code Execution:** The information gained through out-of-bounds read could be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Image File:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by providing a maliciously crafted DDS image file.
- **Triggering the Vulnerability:** The crafted DDS file needs to be processed by the ImageIO framework either directly or indirectly. This could be achieved by various means depending on the application or framework using the ImageIO library. For example, through preview handlers or within default apps.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Deliver Malicious File:** The attacker needs to be able to deliver a specially crafted DDS file to a vulnerable system. This does not require an elevated privilege level to perform.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the image decoding process when `BCReadPlugin::decodeDXTCtoRGBX` is called.
- The `BCReadPlugin::initialize` function incorrectly computes the image data offset and initializes an array which is referenced later.
- The vulnerability is triggered when `IIOImageReadSession::retainBytePointer` returns a pointer to the actual file content. The vulnerability then occurs when this address is incremented by `0x80` before image decoding, resulting in out of bounds access.

**Affected Systems:**
- The vulnerability is confirmed to affect macOS Big Sur 11.6.1, iOS 15.1 and other versions as described in the provided documents. It affects the following systems:
    - macOS Big Sur
    - macOS Catalina
    - macOS Monterey
    - tvOS
    - watchOS
    - iOS
    - iPadOS

**Fix:**
- The issue is addressed by improved bounds checking in the ImageIO framework.
