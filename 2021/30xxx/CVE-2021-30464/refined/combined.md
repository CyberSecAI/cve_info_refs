Denial-of-Service Vulnerability in StationGuard device image
1.00.0048
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
Security Advisory ID: OSA-1
Release Date: 2023-11-22
Revision: 1.1
OMICRON Product Security Team | security@omicronenergy.com
Summary
- ------------------------------------------------------------------------
The client interface of StationGuard device image version 1.00.0048 is
affected by a vulnerability in a 3rd party component that may allow a
remote attacker to cause a denial-of-service of the device. Multiple
specially crafted TCP packets sent to port 20499 of the device can lead
to a denial-of-service situation, so that StationGuard clients cannot
connect to the device anymore.
This vulnerability only affects the CTRL Ethernet port of the device.
The other Ethernet interfaces (STATION) are not affected. The intrusion
detection engine is not affected, alerts are continued to be logged and
stored. Running Syslog (SIEM) connections are not affected, alerts are
continued to be sent out.

## Detect cyber attacks promptly

The Intrusion Detection System (IDS) StationGuard monitors Ethernet networks in the power grid and identifies cyber threats, prohibited activity, and malfunctions.

With this combination of cybersecurity and functional monitoring, not only can new threats and as yet unknown attack scenarios be identified, but different kinds of malfunctions in the power utility automation system too.

## StationGuard - designed for the energy system

Regardless of whether your system is based on IEC 60870-5-104, DNP3, Modbus TCP, or IEC 61850, StationGuard deeply inspects all communication to find cyber threats, prohibited activity, and errors.

Based on our 25+ years’ of experience in power utility automation systems, StationGuard truly understands the communication in power utility automation and SCADA systems. With its unique system model approach, this knowledge is used to determine between legitimate traffic and malicious activity.

StationGuard is the leading cybersecurity solution for your power utility automation and SCADA networks. It detects every threat to your systems, enhances your network performance, and saves operational costs, while ensuring compliance with critical infrastructure cybersecurity standards and regulations.

## Support for commissioning and maintenance

Engineering protocols and IED web interfaces have many known vulnerabilities and new ones are being released all the time. These interfaces are however needed in the commissioning phase and during routine maintenance. To protect your substations against attacks on these ports, you should generally prohibit engineering activity and only allow it when needed. The "Maintenance Mode" enables a high security level by prohibiting engineering activities during normal operation, while providing a low level of false alarms during maintenance phases.

In contrast to baseline or learning based IDS, StationGuard supports the different phases in the lifecycle of a substation with high selectivity in the alerts.

## Expert Support | We make life easy for you

If an alarm indicates prohibited or non-standard-compliant behavior, the StationGuard experts are on hand to help you evaluate the cause. A profile of your substation can also be created on request to offer an alarm analysis targeted specifically for your site and its devices.

In addition to our Technical Support team, who are available 24/7, StationGuard Expert Support helps you to evaluate alarms and perform network capture analyses.
