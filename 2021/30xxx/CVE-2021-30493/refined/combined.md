# Razer Synapse 3 Security Vulnerability Analysis Report

###### VerSprite's VS-Labs found vulnerabilities within Razer Synapse 3 software that can lead to Denial of Service (DoS) attacks

## Razer Synapse 3 Vulnerability Analysis Summary

Razer’s Synapse 3 product contains security-related vulnerabilities that provide less privileged users the ability to write a file to any folder on disk. The Razer Synapse 3 vulnerability is within the improper usage of the Windows Registry, where improper permission assignment leads to local users having full control over multiple important Registry keys relating to the Synapse 3 software suite. Local system services deployed via the Synapse 3 software suite, utilize the Registry Keys to build file name paths to store runtime logging information. The initial impact of these vulnerabilities is a denial of service via system instability; however, full exploitation is not out of the realm of possibilities.

### CVEs for the Razer Synapse 3 Vulnerabilities

* [CVE-2021-30493](/advisories/razer-synapse-3-cve-2021-30493/)
* CVE-2021-30494

## Razer Synapse 3 Vulnerability Remediation

Remediation for these vulnerabilities was performed on February 25th, 2021, when Razer released updates to the Synapse 3 Software suite where the vulnerabilities were mitigated. However, after VerSprite security researchers performed an internal verification of the patch provided by Razer, we concluded that the patch was only a partial solution. The `RzSDKService.exe` service binary still interacted with a critical resource that had improper permissions assigned. Razer has acknowledged the failed patch and stated that they will work on a patch before the end of April 2021. For more information on the entire timeline, please refer to the Vendor Disclosure Timeline section, within the full report.
