- **Root cause:** A logic issue in Kext Management.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Improper state management leading to the ability to load unsigned kernel extensions.
- **Impact:** A local user may be able to load unsigned kernel extensions, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required, as an attacker needs to be a user on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have local user privileges on the macOS Big Sur system.
