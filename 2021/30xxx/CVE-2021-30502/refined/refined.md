Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30502:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper access control when handling custom GHCi commands defined within a workspace configuration. Specifically, the "Simple GHC (Haskell) Integration for VSCode" extension allowed a workspace to specify an arbitrary command via the `ghcSimple.replCommand` configuration.  The extension would execute this command when a Haskell file was opened in the workspace.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control (CWE-284):** The extension did not adequately restrict or validate the commands specified in the `ghcSimple.replCommand` configuration.  It blindly trusted and executed the command, creating a vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  A malicious actor could craft a workspace with a specially crafted `ghcSimple.replCommand` that would execute arbitrary code on the user's machine. This allows complete compromise of the user's system by simply opening a specially crafted Haskell project.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted Workspace Configuration:** An attacker would need to create a malicious workspace containing a `ghcSimple.replCommand` in its configuration that executes malicious code.
- **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to open the malicious workspace within Visual Studio Code, triggering the extension to execute the crafted command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to create a malicious workspace:** The attacker needs to be able to create a workspace that they can convince a victim to open in VS Code.
- **Social Engineering:** An attacker would likely need to use social engineering to get the victim to open the malicious workspace.

**Additional Details from Content:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.2.3 of the extension.
- The fix involves a trust mechanism where the user is prompted to explicitly trust a `ghcSimple.replCommand` before it's executed. The user is warned about the command and the workspace path, and if they allow it, the command is recorded as trusted for that workspace. This prevents malicious workspaces from automatically executing arbitrary commands.
- The `CHANGELOG.md` file provides more detail on the fix, mentioning that both the command and the workspace path must match for the command to be considered the same as a configuration previously trusted.
- The vulnerable versions is identified as versions prior to 0.2.3
