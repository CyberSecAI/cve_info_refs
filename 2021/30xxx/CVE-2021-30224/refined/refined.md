Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:** The Rukovoditel Project Management App (version 2.8.3) lacks proper Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CSRF Vulnerability (User Creation):** The application doesn't validate the origin of requests for creating new users, allowing an attacker to forge requests that add new users, potentially with admin privileges.
*   **CSRF Vulnerability (Password Change):** Similarly, the application doesn't protect against forged requests to change user passwords, enabling an attacker to alter an administrator's password.
*   **Lack of CSRF tokens:** The application does not seem to implement CSRF tokens or similar mechanisms to validate the authenticity of requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker can create a new admin account or change an existing admin's password, effectively gaining full control of the application.
*   **Data Manipulation:**  As mentioned by a user in the forum, successful exploitation can lead to modification or deletion of data, adding new fields, and potentially exposing sensitive information, such as the database password by injecting PHP code.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** The ability to inject PHP code through the vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution on the server and total compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Webpage:** An attacker crafts an HTML page containing malicious forms that automatically submit to the Rukovoditel application. This page is hosted on a server controlled by the attacker.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker tricks a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious page via a link, typically through email.
*   **Same-Site exploitation:** Although not necessary in all configurations, the vulnerability is more easily exploitable if the malicious page is on the same domain as the application or is accessed via the same protocol (e.g. HTTPS). A user with writing permission on a public folder or a user who can upload files might also host malicious code on the same server

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Ability to host web content:** The attacker must be able to host a malicious HTML page.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker must be able to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting their malicious web page.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability has been confirmed by multiple users in the forum and reproduced on a live server.
*   The vulnerability was tested with XAMPP on localhost, but it was also proven to be exploitable on a live server, even when the malicious code was hosted on a separate domain.
*   The application seems to lack any CSRF protection.
*   The exploit relies on a logged-in admin visiting the attacker's page, triggering the submission of the forged requests using the admin's active session cookie.
*   The lack of CSRF protection makes many functions vulnerable to the same attack technique.
