Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-30055:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the `documentexecution/url` component of Knowage Suite version 7.1.
- The vulnerability exists because the `par_year` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection, specifically a boolean-based blind SQL injection. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code through the `par_year` parameter.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the user-supplied `par_year` parameter, allowing malicious SQL code to be embedded in the query.
- **Hardcoded Secret:** The application uses a hardcoded secret for password hashing (HMAC-SHA1), which is exposed in the source code, making the password hashes vulnerable to cracking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary SQL Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
- **Sensitive Data Exfiltration:** Attackers can exfiltrate sensitive data from the database, including user credentials (password hashes).
- **Privilege Escalation:** By gaining access to the password hashes, attackers can crack the superadmin's password (biadmin) and gain full control of the Knowage Suite.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to the `documentexecution/url` endpoint.
- **Malicious SQL Payload:** The SQL injection is achieved by inserting a malicious SQL payload into the `par_year` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Knowage Application:** The attacker needs to have access to the Knowage application, even with limited privileges.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `documentexecution/url` endpoint and the `par_year` parameter.
- **Ability to Craft SQL Payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to create boolean-based blind SQL injection payloads.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- The attacker can distinguish between a true and false SQL condition based on the response code.
- The application returns an error code (1077) if the condition is true, and a generic validation message for a false condition.
- The vulnerability was fixed in Knowage version 7.4.0.
- A PoC was developed that shows how to exploit this vulnerability
- The PoC shows how to dump user password hashes, crack them, and login as superadmin.
