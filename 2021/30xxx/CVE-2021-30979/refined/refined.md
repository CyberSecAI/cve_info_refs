Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow within the Model I/O framework.
- It occurs due to crafted data within an ABC file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.
- Insufficient bounds checking when processing ABC files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- This could lead to complete control of the application, data exfiltration, or further system compromise.
-  The Apple security advisory mentions that processing a maliciously crafted USD file may lead to unexpected application termination or arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted ABC files.
- User interaction, such as opening a malicious file or using an application that loads malicious ABC files, is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- The Zeroday Initiative advisory suggests that the interaction with the ModelIO library is required and attack vectors may vary depending on implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious ABC file to the target.
- The user needs to interact with the malicious file, either directly or through an application that processes ABC files.
- The ZDI advisory states that the attacker can be local.
