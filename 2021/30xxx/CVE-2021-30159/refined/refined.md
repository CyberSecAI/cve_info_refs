Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-30159:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how MediaWiki handles page moves, specifically a "fast double move" scenario. The `MovePage::isValidMoveTarget()` function uses `FOR UPDATE` but is only called if `Title::getArticleID()` returns a non-zero value without special flags. Subsequently, `MovePage::moveToInternal()` deletes the page if `getArticleID(READ_LATEST)` is non-zero.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Race Condition:** A race condition exists between the read and write operations during a page move. If the page is missing in the replica database, `isValidMove()` will return true. Then `moveToInternal()` will delete the page unconditionally if it exists in the master database. This can happen when a user attempts two page moves in quick succession, especially with a lagged replica.
*   **Insufficient Permission Checks:** The system does not consistently check the user's permissions against the master database during the move operation, leading to an exploitable window.
*   **Bypassed Restrictions:** Intended restrictions on deleting pages can be bypassed in these specific "fast double move" scenarios.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Page Deletion:** Non-administrative users can delete pages they do not have permission to delete under normal circumstances, leading to data loss.
*   **Data Loss:** Legitimate page revisions are deleted without a clear log of the deletion, making recovery more difficult.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Fast Double Move:** The vulnerability can be triggered by performing two page move actions in quick succession. This can be done by a single user with a lagged replica, or possibly by separate users.
*   **Lagged Replica Database:** A lagged replica database is a prerequisite to exploitation, as this creates a window in which the first move is not visible in the replica, but the page exists in the master.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Autoconfirmed User:** The attacker needs to be an autoconfirmed user, meaning they have the basic permissions to move pages. They do not need to be an administrator.
*   **Lagged Database:** Either the attacker can cause the replica to be lagged or they can exploit the existing lag.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to execute the second move action within a specific timing window.

**Additional Notes from Phabricator:**
*   The fix involves adding `READ_LATEST` flag to the `getArticleID()` call in the conditional check of the `MovePage::isValidMoveTarget()` function. This ensures the check is performed against the latest state of the page.
*   The issue is considered a security vulnerability and was deployed as a security patch.

In summary, CVE-2021-30159 allows a non-administrative user to delete pages by exploiting a race condition and insufficient permission checks during fast double moves, specifically when a replica database is out of sync.
