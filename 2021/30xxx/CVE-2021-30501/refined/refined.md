Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-30501:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an assertion failure within the `MemBuffer::alloc()` function in `mem.cpp` of the UPX (Ultimate Packer for eXecutables) tool. This assertion is triggered when the function attempts to allocate a memory buffer with a size of 0 bytes. Specifically, the `sizeofcmds` member of a Mach-O header could be zero, leading to the zero-byte allocation request.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Assertion Failure**: The primary weakness is the lack of proper handling for cases where a zero-sized allocation is requested, leading to an assertion failure that terminates the program. This occurs in the `MemBuffer::alloc` function.
-   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The code does not validate the `sizeofcmds` field, leading to the allocation of a zero-sized buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A crafted file with a malformed Mach-O header could be used to trigger the assertion failure, causing UPX to abort, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Crafted File:** The attack vector involves providing UPX with a specially crafted input file, specifically a Mach-O file with `Mach_header.sizeofcmds` set to 0.
    
**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious file to the UPX tool.
-   No special privileges are needed. The attacker needs to be able to invoke the UPX executable.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by adding a check to ensure that `Mach_header.sizeofcmds` is not zero before attempting the allocation in `MemBuffer::alloc()`.

- The fix was implemented in commit `28e761cd42211dfe0124b7a29b2f74730f453e46`.
