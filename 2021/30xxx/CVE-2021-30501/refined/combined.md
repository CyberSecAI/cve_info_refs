| What's the problem (or question)? Same problem like [issue 448](https://github.com/upx/upx/issues/448)but not fix all the bug position. MemBuffer is attempted to be allocated with 0 bytes, failing an assertion in mem.cpp.  asan  ``` ./upx.out -d abort01                        Ultimate Packer for eXecutables                           Copyright (C) 1996 - 2021 UPX git-2638be+ Markus Oberhumer, Laszlo Molnar & John Reiser    Jan 1st 2021          File size         Ratio      Format      Name    --------------------   ------   -----------   ----------- upx.out: mem.cpp:216: void MemBuffer::alloc(upx_uint64_t): Assertion `size > 0' failed.

No failed assertions. Do you have an idea for a solution? Either remove the assertion (probably easier), or add logic to check that allocations are > 0 bytes.  or like the [c55b570](https://github.com/upx/upx/commit/c55b57088daa4a95185b4b7355dac79a0f2cd65e) add some sanitize code. How can we reproduce the issue? 1.Build UPX  ``` export BUILD_TYPE_DEBUG=1 make all  ```  2. Run  ``` ./src/upx.out -d poc   ```  zipped poc : [alloc\_abort01.zip](https://github.com/upx/upx/files/6269446/alloc_abort01.zip) Please tell us details about your environment.  * UPX version used (`upx --version`):  ``` ./upx.out --version                                                                             upx 4.0.0-git-2638bee3c0f7+ UCL data compression library 1.03 zlib data compression library 1.2.11 LZMA SDK version 4.43  ```  * Host Operating System and version:   `OS: Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS x86_64` * Host CPU architecture:   `CPU: Intel i5-4590 (4) @ 3.700GHz` * Target Operating System and version:   `same as Host` * Target CPU architecture:   `same as Host`   reporter: chiba of Topsec alphalab |
