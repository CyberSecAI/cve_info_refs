- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient access control, allowing administrators to move topics to disallowed streams.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  The vulnerability is related to an authorization bypass where the system does not properly check if an administrator is allowed to move a topic to the target stream.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with administrator privileges could potentially move topics to streams where they should not be allowed. This can disrupt the normal functioning of the platform and may be used to confuse or mislead users.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited through the application interface by administrators.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have administrative privileges on the Zulip server.
