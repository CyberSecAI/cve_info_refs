    "description": "Use after free in ANGLE.",
    "root_cause": "Use after free",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use After Free"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "Exploiting a use-after-free vulnerability in ANGLE, the graphics engine abstraction layer for Chrome, can allow an attacker to control program flow and read or write to arbitrary memory locations.",
    "required_capabilities": "Successful exploitation requires the ability to trigger the vulnerability within ANGLE, which is part of the Chrome rendering pipeline. The attacker would need to craft specific content or interactions that would free the memory and then try to reuse the freed memory."
