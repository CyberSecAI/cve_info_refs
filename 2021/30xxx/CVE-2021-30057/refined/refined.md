The provided content relates to CVE-2021-30057.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input when creating or editing analytical drivers. Specifically, the `LABEL` and `NAME` parameters in the `/restful-services/2.0/analyticalDrivers` endpoint are vulnerable to HTML injection.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored HTML injection. The application does not validate or encode user-supplied input before storing it in the database and rendering it in the application's UI.

- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML code into vulnerable fields. This injected code will be persistently stored and executed whenever the affected page is rendered, potentially allowing the attacker to change the design of the website or any information displayed to the user.

- **Attack vectors:** By sending a crafted POST request to `/restful-services/2.0/analyticalDrivers` with malicious HTML code in the `LABEL` and/or `NAME` parameters, an attacker can inject HTML into the application.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to have an authenticated session with an administration profile to access and modify the analytical drivers.
  - The attacker must be able to send POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
