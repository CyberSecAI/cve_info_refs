  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-30185",
    "description": "An external audit of the Indico codebase has discovered a vulnerability in Indico's URL generation logic which could have allowed an attacker to make Indico send a password reset link with a valid token pointing to an attacker-controlled domain by sending that domain in the `Host` header. Had a user clicked such a link without realizing it does not point to Indico (and that they never requested it), it would have revealed their password reset token to the attacker, allowing them to reset the password for that user and thus take over their Indico account.",
    "affected_versions": "< 2.3.4",
    "patched_versions": "2.3.4",
    "root_cause": "Vulnerability in Indico's URL generation logic where the Host header is not validated when generating password reset links, leading to a potential host header injection.",
     "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-640"
        ],
    "impact": "An attacker can send a crafted `Host` header to an Indico server, causing it to generate password reset links that point to an attacker-controlled domain. If a user clicks such a link and enters their password, the attacker gains control of the user's account.",
    "attack_vector": "Network. By sending a malicious crafted 'Host' header to the Indico server.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker only needs to be able to send network requests with a crafted `Host` header to the vulnerable Indico server. No authentication or special privileges required."
