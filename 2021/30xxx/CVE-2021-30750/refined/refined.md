Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-30750:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A logic issue in the Sandbox component.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is described as a logic issue, which suggests flawed implementation in the sandbox's permission handling. The document also mentions that the vulnerability was addressed with improved permission logic, meaning that the sandbox did not properly enforce access controls.

**Impact of exploitation:** A malicious application could potentially gain access to a user's recent contacts by exploiting this vulnerability. This access would be a bypass of the intended sandboxing restrictions.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited by a malicious application, indicating local exploitation. The application would need to interact with the Sandbox component in a way that reveals the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to run a malicious application on the target system to exploit the issue.

In summary, a malicious application can bypass sandbox restrictions to access a user's recent contacts due to a logic flaw in permission enforcement within the Sandbox component.
