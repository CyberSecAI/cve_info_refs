Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-30155:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause is a missing permission check in the `ContentModelChange` functionality of MediaWiki. Specifically, when a user attempts to create a new page and simultaneously set its content model using `Special:ChangeContentModel`, the system doesn't properly verify if the user has the necessary permissions to create the page in the first place, particularly in relation to the configured `TitleBlacklist`. This happens because `ContentModelChange` doesn't initially go through the normal edit page checks but instead relies on `WikiPage::doEditContent` after some checks and does not include the TitleBlacklist check.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Permission Checks:** The `ContentModelChange` functionality lacks a check to determine if a user is authorized to create the page they are trying to create with a new content model.
- **Bypass of Title Blacklist:**  Because of the missing permission checks, the Title Blacklist restrictions, meant to prevent certain page titles from being created, can be bypassed when creating new pages using `Special:ChangeContentModel`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Unauthorized Page Creation:** Users who would otherwise be prevented from creating pages due to `TitleBlacklist` rules can successfully create such pages by using `Special:ChangeContentModel` to create the page and simultaneously set its content model.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **`Special:ChangeContentModel`:**  The attack vector involves using the `Special:ChangeContentModel` page in MediaWiki to create a non-existent page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **MediaWiki User:**  The attacker needs to be a registered user with the ability to access and use the `Special:ChangeContentModel` page.
- **Bypass Creation Restrictions:** The user must have the ability to use `Special:ChangeContentModel` and  be trying to create a page which they are otherwise not permitted to create due to TitleBlacklist rules.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerability is located in the `includes/content/ContentModelChange.php` file (or `includes/specials/SpecialChangeContentModel.php` for older versions).
- The fix involves adding a check within the `ContentModelChange` process to verify that the user has the "create" permission before creating the page (as opposed to only checking "editcontentmodel" and "edit" permissions). This check is performed by using `PermissionManager`'s `getPermissionErrors` or `getUserPermissionsErrors`.
- The patch addresses the issue by adding permission checks specifically for the "createpage" or "createtalk" action or just the create action, when the page does not yet exist.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability was fixed in MediaWiki versions 1.35.2, 1.31.14, and later.
- The vulnerability was also present in the REL1_31 branch, and a specific patch was created for that version.
- The fix was deployed during a security window and tested by DannyS712.
- The fix also addresses extensions that use the "create" action, not just "createpage" or "createtalk".
