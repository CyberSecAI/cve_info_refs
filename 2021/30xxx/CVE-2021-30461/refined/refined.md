- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper filtering of user-supplied data in the `SPOOLDIR` parameter within the VoIPmonitor web interface. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into the `config/configuration.php` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unauthenticated remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to the `index.php` file with a malicious `SPOOLDIR` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable VoIPmonitor web interface. No prior authentication is required.
