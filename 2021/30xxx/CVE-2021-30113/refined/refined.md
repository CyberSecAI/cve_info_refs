Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Add Events" functionality of Web-School ERP V 5.0. Specifically, the event name and description fields do not sanitize JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a blind XSS. This occurs because the injected JavaScript payload is stored in the database and is executed when a user views the affected content, specifically the event details.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The system does not properly sanitize or encode user input before storing it in the database or rendering it in the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Exfiltration:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that steals sensitive information from the victim's browser (e.g., cookies, session tokens, etc) and sends it to an attacker-controlled server.
- **Account Hijacking:** By stealing session cookies, an attacker can potentially hijack the victim's account.
- **Malicious Actions:** Arbitrary JavaScript execution allows an attacker to perform any action within the context of the user's session and browser including redirecting the user to a malicious website, modifying the content of the page, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code through the "Add Events" form. Specifically, the event name or the description fields are vulnerable to the injection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Web-School ERP application with permissions to add events.
- **JavaScript Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft JavaScript payloads that will execute their desired malicious actions.
