3  Vulnerability details

3.1  Detailed Description

The CODESYS web server is used by the CODESYS WebVisu to visualize CODESYS screens in a web
browser. It has the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2021-30189: CWE-121: Stack-based Buffer Overflow
Crafted web server requests may cause a stack-based buffer overflow and could therefore execute arbitrary
code on the CODESYS web server or trigger a denial-of-service condition due to a crash in the CODESYS web
server.

CVE-2021-30190: CWE-284: Improper Access Control
The user management of the CODESYS V2.3 WebVisu allows user-dependent control of access to the
visualization pages. However, subordinate requests to read or write values are forwarded to the CODESYS
Control runtime system regardless of successful authentication. This enables crafted web server requests to
bypass the user management and to read or write values on the PLC without authentication.

CVE-2021-30191: CWE-120: Buffer Copy without Checking Size of Input
Crafted web server requests can cause an over-read or over-write of a buffer in the CODESYS web server,
which usually leads to a denial-of-service condition.

CVE-2021-30192: CWE-358: Improperly Implemented Security Check
Crafted web server requests can bypass the security checks for boot project-related files on the CODESYS
Control runtime system to upload them from the CODESYS Control runtime system.

CVE-2021-30193: CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write
Crafted web server requests can be utilized to write arbitrary memory in the CODESYS Control runtime system
and could therefore execute code on the CODESYS Control runtime system or lead to a denial-of-service
condition due to a crash of the CODESYS Control runtime system.

4/5

Advisory 2021-07

CVE-2021-30194: CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read
Crafted web server requests can be utilized to read arbitrary memory in the CODESYS Control runtime system
or can also crash the CODESYS web server.

3.2  Exploitability

These vulnerabilities could be exploited remotely.

3.3  Difficulty

An attacker with low skills would be able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

3.4  Existence of exploit

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.

4  Available software updates

CODESYS GmbH has released version V1.1.9.20 of the CODESYS V2 web server to solve the noted
vulnerability issues. This version of the CODESYS V2 web server is also part of the CODESYS Development
System setup version V2.3.9.66.

Please visit the CODESYS update area for more information on how to obtain the software update [3].

Update:
For compatibility reasons, starting from version V1.1.9.21 the CODESYS web server supports the new setting
disable-secure-monitoring in webserver_conf.xml. This setting re-enables direct monitoring of var_inout
variables of function blocks in addition to the usual monitoring of the caller variables. Since this setting weakens
the security checks introduced to prevent CVE-2021-30194 attacks, CODESYS GmbH strongly recommends
enabling this setting only if this feature is really needed by a specific CODESYS Webvisu application.
Furthermore, enabling this setting requires a secure environment or appropriate compensation means.

CODESYS GmbH has released version V1.1.9.21 of the CODESYS V2 web server both stand-alone and also
as part of the CODESYS Development System setup version V2.3.9.67.

5  Mitigation

CODESYS GmbH recommends using the available software update to fix the vulnerabilities.

Currently, CODESYS GmbH has not identified any specific workarounds for these vulnerabilities, in case the
software update is not applied.

As part of a security strategy, CODESYS GmbH recommends the following general defense measures to
reduce the risk of exploits:
• Use controllers and devices only in a protected environment to minimize network exposure and ensure that
they are not accessible from outside
• Use firewalls to protect and separate the control system network from other networks
• Use VPN (Virtual Private Networks) tunnels if remote access is required
• Activate and apply user management and password features
• Use encrypted communication links
• Limit the access to both development and control system by physical means, operating system features, etc.
• Protect both development and control system by using up to date virus detecting solutions
For more information and general recommendations for protecting machines and plants, see also the
CODESYS Security Whitepaper [1].
