Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-30825:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read within the CoreML framework when parsing a crafted mlmodel file. Specifically, the crafted data in the file can cause the software to read past the end of an allocated data structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The software attempts to read memory outside the bounds of allocated buffer.
- Information disclosure: This leads to disclosure of potentially sensitive information

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: A remote attacker can disclose sensitive information on affected macOS installations.
- Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution: The vulnerability can be combined with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process, but this is not explicitly part of this specific vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted mlmodel file: The attacker crafts a specific mlmodel file that triggers the out-of-bounds read when processed by the CoreML framework. The specific attack vector would vary depending on the implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted mlmodel file to be processed.
- User interaction is required for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects macOS.
- The vulnerability was reported to Apple on 2021-06-04.
- The vulnerability was addressed in an update from Apple.
- The vulnerability is present in the CoreML library.
