Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free error that occurs in the sensor handling component of the Chromium browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free: This occurs when a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation could potentially lead to a crash of the browser, arbitrary code execution, or other undefined behavior, potentially allowing an attacker to gain control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered through the browser's sensor handling mechanism, which is used by web applications to interact with device sensors.
- A malicious actor could craft a webpage or inject malicious code into a webpage that exploits this flaw.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need the ability to deliver a malicious webpage or inject malicious javascript into a webpage visited by the victim.
- No specific user interaction beyond visiting a malicious page is required to trigger the vulnerability.
- Successful exploitation would require a vulnerable version of the Chromium browser.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by niarci on 2019-11-11 in the upstream chromium bug tracker.
- The fix was included in Chromium version 92.0.4515.107 and subsequent versions.
- This vulnerability affects users of Chromium-based browsers (e.g., Google Chrome, Microsoft Edge, etc.)
