Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

**Vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow in Zoom client's handling of encrypted messages.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of user-supplied data length before copying it into a fixed-size heap buffer during the processing of encrypted messages using the "Advanced chat encryption" feature (version 1). Specifically, the issue is present when decrypting messages encrypted with AES, where a check to ensure the decrypted output would fit in the 1024 byte buffer is missing. This lack of proper length checking allows a malicious actor to send a specially crafted message that, upon decryption, will cause a heap buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   Heap-based buffer overflow: Specifically within the AES decryption process when handling a `ResponseKey` message with the old encryption protocol.
*   Insufficient input validation: Missing check for the size of the decrypted data before copying it to the fixed size buffer.
*   Use of a vulnerable version of OpenSSL: The use of OpenSSL which did not have CFG enabled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Remote Code Execution (RCE): An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine by sending a malicious message. This can lead to a complete system compromise.
*   No User Interaction Required: The exploit can be triggered without any user interaction, as long as the victim has accepted a contact request from the attacker or is part of the same multi-user chat.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network: Exploitation occurs through the Zoom chat feature over the network. The attacker sends a crafted message to the target user.
*   XMPP: The exploit leverages the XMPP protocol to deliver the malicious messages.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Established Contact or Same Organization: The attacker needs to be an accepted external contact or a part of the same organization as the victim.
*   Ability to Send Messages: The attacker must be able to send chat messages to the victim.
*   Technical Knowledge: The attacker needs in-depth knowledge of heap overflows and memory corruption exploits, and be able to perform complex heap grooming and ROP chaining.

**Technical details**
*   The vulnerability is triggered in a function that decrypts data using AES. The code allocates a 1024-byte buffer for the decrypted output. In the vulnerable path, the code does not validate the size of the decrypted data before writing to the buffer, resulting in a heap overflow.
*   The exploit chain also involved an info leak vulnerability to bypass ASLR and a GIPHY path traversal vulnerability to place a ROP chain.
*   The exploit uses a stack pivot to control the stack and then uses ROP to execute the payload, which starts with `GetModuleHandleW` and `GetProcAddress` to eventually invoke `VirtualProtect` in order to execute shellcode.
*   The vulnerable code is in `zoom_crypto_util.h`, specifically the `AESDecode` function. The code was identified in the Zoom SDK.
*   The heap allocation was performed using the NT heap and LFH.
*   The exploited OpenSSL DLLs were `libcrypto-1_1.dll` and the code execution occurred in `viper.dll`.

**Additional Notes**
*   The exploit was demonstrated at Pwn2Own 2021 by Daan Keuper and Thijs Alkemade and awarded $200,000.
*   The exploit affects both Windows and macOS versions of the Zoom client.
*   The vulnerability is present in the "Advanced chat encryption" version 1 protocol.
*   The provided content mentions related Zoom Security Bulletins: ZSB-21003 and ZDI-21-971 for CVE-2021-34407, suggesting that the vulnerability is addressed in updates.
*   The content also described the process for creating the exploit from network analysis to debugging and finally exploiting. It included specific techniques for heap grooming, info leaks and ROP chains.
