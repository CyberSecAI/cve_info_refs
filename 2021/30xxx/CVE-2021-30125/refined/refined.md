The provided document discusses bug fixes and enhancements in Jamf Pro 10.28.0. It mentions two specific security issues:

**1. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) Vulnerability:**
   - **Root cause:** An issue in Jamf Pro allowed cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against inventory history.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** XSS vulnerability.
   - **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the inventory history, potentially leading to unauthorized actions, data theft, or other malicious activities.
   - **Attack vectors:** By injecting malicious scripts that are then displayed to other users when they view inventory history.
   - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need the ability to inject scripts, likely through a field or parameter that is not properly sanitized.

**2. Command Injection via CSV Reports:**
   - **Root cause:** Jamf Pro created CSV reports without sanitizing information, which allowed potentially injected commands to run when the report was opened in certain applications.
   - **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Command injection vulnerability through CSV report generation.
   - **Impact of exploitation:** When a user opens a malicious CSV file generated by Jamf Pro, the injected commands could be executed, potentially allowing the attacker to run arbitrary code on the user's system or manipulate their environment.
   - **Attack vectors:** By injecting commands into fields that are then written to the generated CSV reports.
    - **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to modify the data that is being included in a CSV export.

The document mentions these are security issues that have been fixed in Jamf Pro 10.28.0.
