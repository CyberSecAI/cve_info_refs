# Bug Fixes and Enhancements

**Correction—Updated 1 April 2021**

The following bug fix in Jamf Pro 10.28.0 was inadvertently not included in the original publishing of these release notes:

[PI-009376] Fixed an issue in Jamf Pro that allowed cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks against inventory history.

# Jamf Pro Server: Security Issues

[PI-007380] Fixed an issue that allowed Jamf Pro to create CSV reports without sanitizing information, allowing for potentially injected commands to be run upon opening in certain applications.

# Jamf Pro Server

* [PI-002186] Fixed an issue that sometimes caused Jamf Pro to continuously send the InstallApplication command to apps that were configured to install automatically on devices enrolled with a PreStage enrollment.
* [PI-004011] Fixed an issue that caused apps to remain in a pending state on devices after re-enrollment when installing several apps on a computer or mobile device without sending the Update Inventory command before wiping the device.
* [PI-004407] Fixed an issue that caused Jamf Pro to experience performance issues when importing users from Apple School Manager when there were existing user extension attributes in Jamf Pro.
* [PI-004428] Fixed an issue that sometimes caused significant delays in app deployment time when deploying several in-house apps simultaneously to a large environment.
* [PI-004486] Fixed an issue that caused LDAP User Group scope limitations removal failure if the Group ID Attribute Mappings value in the LDAP server configuration in Jamf Pro was modified and a new session with the server was established.
* [PI-005212], [PI-008566] Fixed an issue that caused the initial credentials used to configure SCEP Proxy in Jamf Pro to be incorrectly cached. This prevented updated certificate requests from using the correct credentials.
* [PI-005531] Fixed an issue that failed to run policies with an LDAP user or LDAP user group limitation in Self Service for macOS when Self Service User Login was disabled and the computer was assigned to an LDAP user.
* [PI-007035] Fixed an issue that caused all installed applications from the computer inventory record to clear when emojis in the name of an app installed on a computer were used.
* [PI-007594] The IMEI2 and EID values for Dual SIM devices are now retrieved and are displayed in the Jamf Pro inventory report.
* [PI-008708] Fixed an issue that caused looking up a re-enrolled computer using the Jamf Pro API to fail when the Re-enrollment settings were configured with Location and Location History flushing enabled in the Jamf Pro interface.
* [PI-008797] Fixed an issue that could cause a mobile device's inventory information to be deleted from Jamf Pro if the mobile device does not immediately submit inventory when Jamf Pro issues an Update Inventory command.
* [PI-009096] Fixed an issue that caused Self Service for macOS to occasionally fail to launch on computers with macOS 11.
* [PI-009166] Fixed an issue that sometimes caused inventory updates for mobile devices to fail if they belonged to a smart group with the MDM Profile Renewal Needed criteria and Jamf Pro's built-in CA certificate was not renewed.
* [PI-009228] Fixed an issue that caused the Azure registration workflow to fail when the JamfAAD retry logic was applied.
* [PI-009250] Fixed an issue that prevented Jamf Pro from writing application details to a mobile device inventory record when an app that contained an emoji in its name was installed on the mobile device.
* [PI-009298] Fixed an issue that caused a computer deactivation state to be sent to Azure when an Azure AD registered user password was changed.
* [PI-009312] Fixed an issue that caused labels in some pages of Jamf Pro to not be translated to languages other than English.
* [PI-009316] Fixed an issue that caused the navigation bar in Self Service for macOS to jump around while a user is scrolling.
* [PI-009340] Fixed an issue that caused Jamf Pro performance issues when the RemoveProfile MDM command was issued for configuration profiles installed using a method other than MDM.
* [PI-009349] Fixed an issue that prevented configuration profiles with a SCEP payload from deploying and installing certificates when Jamf Pro was enabled as SCEP Proxy and more than one attribute was entered in the Subject Name field.
* [PI-009394] Fixed an issue that prevented categories from displaying in the navigation bar in Self Service for macOS.
