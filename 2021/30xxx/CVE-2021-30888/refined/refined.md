Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30888:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an information leakage issue related to how Content Security Policy (CSP) reports are handled, specifically concerning redirect behavior.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Information Leakage: A malicious website using CSP reports can potentially leak sensitive information via redirect behavior. This suggests that the way the browser handles redirects in conjunction with CSP reporting exposes a weakness.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure: A malicious website may be able to leak information via redirect behavior by exploiting the way Content Security Policy reports are handled. This could potentially expose user data or sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious Website: A website controlled by the attacker is required to exploit the vulnerability.
- CSP Reports: The attack leverages the functionality of Content Security Policy reports.
- Redirect Behavior: The vulnerability is specifically triggered by the way redirects are handled by the browser in conjunction with CSP reports.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious CSP reports that trigger the redirect behavior leading to the information leakage.
