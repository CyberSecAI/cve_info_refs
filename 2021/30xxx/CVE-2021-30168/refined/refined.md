Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which corresponds to CVE-2021-30168:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the insecure storage of user credentials within an HTML file. Specifically, the admin's username and password are present in the `/new/setup.htm` file, encoded with Base64.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Admin Credential Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of admin credentials through an insecure method. The credentials are not properly protected and can be accessed by an attacker.
*   **Insecure Storage:** The storage of credentials in an HTML file is a significant weakness, as these files are often easily accessible.
*   **Base64 Encoding:** While encoding is used, Base64 is easily reversible and not an appropriate method for securing sensitive credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Device Control:** By obtaining the admin credentials, an attacker can gain complete control over the device.
*   **Malware Installation:** With admin access, an attacker can install malware on the device.
*   **Further Attacks:** The exposed credentials could be used to launch further attacks on the network or other connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is through network access to the device's web interface.
*   **Direct File Access:** An attacker can directly access the `/new/setup.htm` file which contains the base64 encoded credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable camera.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** No prior authentication is required to access the vulnerable HTML page and obtain credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is considered critical and has a high CVSS score of 9.8 in one of the provided documents.
*   The vulnerability affects LILIN IP Camera P2 and Z2 series with firmware version <= 7.1.94.8908.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Keniver Wang and ChunHao Yang of CHT Security.

**Summary of extracted information:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Remote Admin Credential Disclosure
*   **Root Cause:** Insecure storage of admin credentials in `/new/setup.htm` with base64 encoding
*   **Impact:** Full device control, malware installation, further attacks
*   **Attack Vector:** Network access to the device, direct access to vulnerable file
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Network access, no authentication needed
*   **Affected Products:** LILIN IP Camera P2 and Z2 series with firmware version <= 7.1.94.8908
