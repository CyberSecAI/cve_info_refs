The provided content discusses two vulnerabilities in Textpattern version V4.8.4, which was later assigned CVE-2021-30209.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root Cause:** Unrestricted plugin upload in the backend, lacking security checks.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Absence of security verification during plugin uploads.
    *   Lack of login verification code and account lockout policy, allowing brute-force attacks on the admin login.
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary file upload leading to Remote Code Execution. An attacker can upload malicious PHP files (Trojans) and gain system permissions.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker gains access to the backend through brute-force login attempts.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to perform brute-force attacks on the admin login and upload a malicious PHP file

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root Cause:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the article writing feature.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Lack of proper input sanitization/filtering of malicious code in the article writing feature.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious code via article content. When a user (including the administrator) views the article, the malicious code is executed. This can lead to the attacker obtaining administrator cookies and thereby gaining control of the system.
*   **Attack Vector:**  A low-privilege user publishes malicious code within an article.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** Requires the ability to create/edit articles and inject malicious code.

The issue was addressed by fixing the plugin upload in version 4.9, and the XSS was stated to be a user privilege issue.
