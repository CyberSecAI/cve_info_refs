{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper privilege management in the `appmgrd` service.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The framework user has write access to `/var/tmp/framework` directory, allowing them to create executable files.",
      "The framework user has read/write access to the `/var/local/appreg.db` sqlite database, which is used to store application registry data.",
      "The `appmgrd` service, which runs with root privileges, uses the application registry to launch applications based on the commands specified in the `value` field of the `properties` table without proper sanitization or validation."
    ],
    "impact": "A framework user can execute arbitrary code with root privileges, leading to complete device compromise. This allows attackers to delete e-books, potentially gain full access to the Amazon account, convert the Kindle into a bot, and attack other devices in the local network.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious application is launched by the framework user using `appmgrd` service. This is achieved by modifying the application registry database."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to gain code execution as the 'framework' user, which is achieved through exploiting CVE-2021-30354.",
       "Ability to modify application registry database `/var/local/appreg.db`."
    ],
     "additional_info": "The `appmgrd` service runs with root rights and launches built-in apps by reading their corresponding entries from the `appreg.db` database. By modifying the `value` field of a command entry (such as `com.lab126.browser`), the framework user can force `appmgrd` to execute an arbitrary script with root privileges."
