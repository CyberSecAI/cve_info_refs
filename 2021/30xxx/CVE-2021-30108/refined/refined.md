Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-30108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the application's improper handling of the `Referer` HTTP header. The application uses the value of the `Referer` header to construct redirect URLs without proper validation or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The primary vulnerability is an SSRF. An attacker can manipulate the `Referer` header to force the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Request Execution:** By controlling the `Referer` header, an attacker can cause the server to make HTTP requests to any URL, including internal resources that are not publicly accessible.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information from internal services or the exploitation of other vulnerabilities in internal systems.
*   **Denial of Service:** In some cases, attackers might use this vulnerability to cause a denial of service by directing the server to overload another service with requests.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Referer Header Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is modifying the `Referer` header of HTTP requests made to the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   **Ability to Modify HTTP Headers:** The attacker must be able to modify the `Referer` header in their requests (e.g., using a web proxy like Burp Suite).
*   **Basic understanding of HTTP protocol**: The attacker needs to understand how the HTTP protocol works, specifically the function of the Referer header.
*   **User registration on target application**: The attacker needs to create an account on the target application.
*   **Application logout and login**: The attacker needs to be able to log out and log into the application.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **Specific Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerability is linked to how the application generates redirects after a user logs in, specifically in `common/components/Response.php` file.
*   **Exploitation Steps:** The provided content details the steps to exploit the vulnerability including registering a user, manipulating the `Referer` header in a login request and then logging into the application.
*   **Fix:** The fix is mentioned in the commit `d45cb9c` which appears to be related to checking for absolute URLs in the redirect function of `common/components/Response.php`, indicating that the vulnerability was resolved by implementing proper checks on redirect URLs.
*   **Affected Component:** The `feehi/cms` package is identified as the affected component.
*   **CVSS Score:**  A CVSS score of 9.1 is given, indicating a critical severity vulnerability with low attack complexity, no required privileges and no user interaction.

**Summary**

CVE-2021-30108 is a critical SSRF vulnerability found in Feehi CMS 2.1.1. It is caused by the improper handling of the HTTP `Referer` header. This allows attackers to force the server to make arbitrary requests to other systems, potentially leading to information disclosure and other malicious activities.
