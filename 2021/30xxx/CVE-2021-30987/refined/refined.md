- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An access issue was present in the Airport component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of proper access restrictions which allowed for passive tracking.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A device could be passively tracked via BSSIDs.
- **Attack vectors**: Passive tracking through BSSIDs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need to interact with the device directly, they simply need to be able to passively monitor BSSID information.
