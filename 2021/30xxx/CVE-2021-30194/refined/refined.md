Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30194:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read in the CODESYS V2 web server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **CWE-125:** Out-of-bounds Read. The CODESYS web server does not properly validate the bounds of data being accessed, potentially allowing an attacker to read memory outside the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can read arbitrary memory within the CODESYS Control runtime system.
*   The vulnerability could also lead to a crash of the CODESYS web server, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by crafted web server requests. These requests can be sent remotely.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs network access to the CODESYS V2 web server.
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft malicious web server requests.
*   The attacker does not need any user authentication to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all CODESYS V2 web servers running stand-alone or as part of the CODESYS runtime system prior to version V1.1.9.20.
*   The CVSS v3.0 base score for this vulnerability is 10 (Critical). The vector string is (CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Vyacheslav Moskvin, Sergey Fedonin and Anton Dorfman of Positive Technologies.
*   A software update (version V1.1.9.20 of the CODESYS V2 web server) is available to fix the vulnerability.
*   The advisory mentions a new setting `disable-secure-monitoring` which weakens the security checks, which is discouraged to be used unless there is a specific need.
