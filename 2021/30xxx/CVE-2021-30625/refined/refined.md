  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-30625",
    "description": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the Selection API of Blink rendering engine in Google Chrome 92.0.4515.131 (Stable) and 94.0.4597.1 (Canary). A specially-crafted web page can trigger reuse of previously freed memory which can lead to arbitrary code execution. Victim would need to visit a malicious website to trigger this vulnerability.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is triggered due to the improper handling of node visibility within the `DOMSelection::setBaseAndExtent` function. When nodes are styled with `content-visibility: hidden;`, the engine fails to recognize their visibility correctly. This results in a use-after-free condition because the code attempts to use objects which have already been freed during the update of the layout tree.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free in Selection API"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution due to control over freed memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A specially crafted web page needs to be visited by a victim to trigger the vulnerability."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs to create a malicious website or inject malicious content into a website visited by the target."
    ],
   "additional_details": "The vulnerability occurs within the `setBaseAndExtent` method of the Selection API. Specifically, the crash occurs inside `blink::LayoutObject::LayoutObjectBitfields::IsBox()`. The function `UpdateCachedVisibleSelectionIfNeeded` is responsible for checking if all nodes are visible. However, when nodes are styled with `content-visibility: hidden;`, the engine does not recognize the visibility of nodes inside the `DOMSelection::setBaseAndExtent` function. The function `setBaseAndExtent` is responsible for selecting all nodes between two given nodes. The arguments must have meaningful hierarchy, where the `anchorNode` must be a parent of `focusNode` and `anchorOffset` must be less than or equal to `focusOffset`."
