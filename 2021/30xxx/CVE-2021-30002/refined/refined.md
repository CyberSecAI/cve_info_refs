Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30002:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content clearly relates to CVE-2021-30002, described as a memory leak in the Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem. This is explicitly stated in the Debian LTS advisory, the SUSE bug report and the commit message from git.kernel.org.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a memory leak in the `video_usercopy()` function within the Linux kernel's Video4Linux (v4l) subsystem.
- When handling IOCTLs with large argument sizes (greater than 128 bytes) and array arguments, the function was making two memory allocations but only freeing the latter one. This happened because a single local variable was used to hold the pointers to these allocations, causing the first allocation to be lost.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Memory Leak:** Failure to deallocate allocated memory leads to resource exhaustion.
- **Incorrect Resource Management:** Using a single variable to track multiple allocations.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A local user with access to video devices can repeatedly trigger the vulnerable IOCTL, causing memory exhaustion, leading to a system crash, or making the system unresponsive.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Local User Interaction:** A local user who can access video devices can trigger the vulnerable IOCTL.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Local User Access:** The attacker needs to be a local user with permissions to access video devices. The Debian LTS advisory and the SUSE bug report note that, by default, this includes any member of the "video" group.

**Additional details:**

- The commit message from git.kernel.org provides details on the fix: adding separate variables to hold pointers to temporary allocations to ensure all are freed.
- The SUSE bugzilla entry notes that `video_usercopy()` is used for all IOCTLs in V4L, meaning "everybody can OOM any system with a webcam". It also states that the fix is present in v5.12-rc1 and all SLE11-SP3 or newer kernels are affected.
- The Debian LTS advisory explicitly lists CVE-2021-30002 as a memory leak vulnerability in the Video4Linux subsystem exploitable by a local user.
- The Leap 15.2 kernel update request on build.opensuse.org indicates that this fix was backported and included in the kernel update.
- The debian advisory also mentions this issue is fixed in version 4.9.272-1

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

| Item                        | Description                                                                                                                                |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| **Root Cause**              | Memory leak in `video_usercopy()` due to incorrect tracking of temporary allocations.                                                   |
| **Vulnerabilities**         | Memory leak; incorrect resource management                                                                                                |
| **Impact**                  | Denial of service via memory exhaustion.                                                                                                |
| **Attack Vectors**          | Local user accessing video devices and triggering a vulnerable IOCTL.                                                                    |
| **Attacker Capabilities**   | Local user with permissions to access video devices (typically members of the video group).                                           |
| **Fix**                     | Separate variables for temporary allocations to ensure correct deallocation.                                                             |
| **Affected Versions**       | All Linux kernels from v2.6.39 up until the fix. Specifically, SLE11-SP3 or newer are affected. Fixed in 5.12-rc1 and 4.9.272-1 (Debian) |
