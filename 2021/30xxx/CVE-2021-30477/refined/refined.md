- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Outgoing webhook bots were able to send arbitrary messages to any stream.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, allowing webhook bots to send messages to unauthorized streams.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially use a compromised webhook bot to send messages to any stream, potentially disrupting communication, spreading misinformation or malicious content.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability if they have control of an outgoing webhook bot.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs control of an outgoing webhook bot in the Zulip system.
