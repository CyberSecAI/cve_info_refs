Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way the Check Point Harmony Browse and SandBlast Agent for Browsers for Windows handles repair operations using the Windows Installer framework. Specifically, the MSI file cached in `c:\windows\installer` can be triggered by an unprivileged user to initiate a repair operation. This repair process involves file operations in the user's `%TEMP%` folder, some of which are executed with SYSTEM privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Operations:** The core vulnerability lies in the fact that the Windows Installer service, running as SYSTEM, performs operations in a user-controlled temporary directory (`%TEMP%`). This allows a malicious actor to potentially introduce malicious files into the `%TEMP%` directory that the repair process will then execute with SYSTEM privileges.
*   **Abuse of Windows Installer Repair:** The ability of an unprivileged user to trigger a repair operation using a cached MSI file is a weakness that is exploited in this vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit grants an unprivileged local attacker SYSTEM level privileges. This allows the attacker to perform any action on the system, including installing software, modifying files, and accessing sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. An attacker needs to have local access to the Windows machine.
*   **Triggering Repair:** The attacker triggers the vulnerable repair operation either via the Windows Installer API or by using `msiexec.exe`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs to have a valid local user account on the target Windows system.
*   **Basic System Knowledge:** The attacker needs some knowledge of how Windows Installer and MSI files work to trigger a repair. No specialized knowledge is needed for the specific exploit once the vulnerability is known.
