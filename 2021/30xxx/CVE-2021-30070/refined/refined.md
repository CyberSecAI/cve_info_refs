The provided content relates to commits in the Hestia Control Panel repository that address a vulnerability. Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `v-update-sys-hestia` script previously accepted any package name as input for updates, allowing potentially malicious or unintended packages to be installed via the command line, API, or web GUI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted package updates: The lack of validation on the package name allowed the execution of the update script with arbitrary package names.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The script could be exploited to install non-Hestia controlled packages.
- This could lead to compromise of the system by installing malicious software or unintended configurations.

**Attack vectors:**
- CLI: An attacker could directly invoke the `v-update-sys-hestia` command with a malicious package name.
- API: An attacker could send a crafted API request to trigger the update process with an arbitrary package.
- Web GUI: An attacker with access to the web GUI might be able to exploit the update function if it didn't properly validate package inputs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the Hestia control panel through any of the attack vectors mentioned above.
- Ability to execute commands, either directly on the server or through the API/GUI.

**Technical details:**

The vulnerability is addressed in the commits by adding a validation step before performing the update:

- **`bin/v-update-sys-hestia`:**
    -  The commit introduces a function `is_hestia_package` to validate the provided package name against an allowed list: `hestia,hestia-nginx,hestia-php`.
    - The command `is_hestia_package "hestia,hestia-nginx,hestia-php" "$package"` has been added to `bin/v-update-sys-hestia`. This checks whether the provided package is in the whitelist.
- **`func/main.sh`:**
    - The function `is_hestia_package` was added which checks if the package passed to `v-update-sys-hestia` is in the whitelist using `grep -w $2`. If the package is not in the whitelist the script will exit and return an error using `check_result $E_INVALID`.
