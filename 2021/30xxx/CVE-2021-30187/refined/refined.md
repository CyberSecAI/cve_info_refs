Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30187:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command (CWE-78) within the CODESYS Control V2 Linux SysFile library implementation. This allows a control programmer to call additional OS functions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Neutralization of Special Elements (CWE-78):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of inputs when constructing OS commands within the SysFile library. This permits the injection of malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary OS Command Execution:** A malicious control programmer could exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary OS commands on the underlying system. This could lead to various malicious activities.
- **Potential Loss of Control:** An attacker could gain control of the system, possibly disrupting its functionality or leading to data breaches.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The ability to execute OS commands can potentially enable privilege escalation and other attacks.
- **Unauthorized Access to System Resources:** The vulnerability could allow unauthorized access to sensitive information and resources on the affected devices.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **PLC Logic:** Attackers can inject malicious commands through the PLC logic via the SysFile system library.
- **Exploitation:** PLC programmers can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control Programmer Access:** The attacker needs to be a control programmer with the ability to program the controller.
- **Authentication or Lack of Password:** The attacker either has to have successfully authenticated on the controller or the controller has no online access password configured
- **Low Skill Level:** The exploit is not complex, so even an attacker with limited skills can exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects all runtime systems for Linux based on CODESYS V2 Runtime Toolkit 32 bit full prior version V2.4.7.55.
- There are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability at the time of the advisory.
- CODESYS GmbH has rated the vulnerability as Medium with a CVSS v3.0 base score of 5.3 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L).
- A software update (CODESYS Runtime Toolkit 32 bit full version V2.4.7.55) has been released to address the vulnerability.
- CODESYS recommends general security measures such as network segmentation, VPNs, user management, and regular virus scanning to reduce the risk of exploits.
