Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to CVE-2021-30111:

**Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "Add Events" functionality of the Web-School ERP V 5.0. Specifically, the event name and description fields are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not sanitize user input before storing it in the database. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored on the server and executed when a user views the affected page. This type of vulnerability is considered a stored XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker can inject JavaScript that will be executed within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Data theft and Manipulation:** This malicious script can be used to steal cookies, session tokens, user credentials, or perform other actions such as redirecting users to a malicious website or altering website content.
*   **Account Compromise:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain control of a user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web interface by injecting malicious script in event name and description fields.
*   **User interaction:** Attack requires a user to view the compromised page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to Add Events:** The attacker needs to have the privilege to access and add events within the Web-School ERP system.
*   **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to be capable of crafting a JavaScript payload to inject.

**Additional Details from Content:**
*   **Affected Product:** Web-School ERP V 5.0
*   **Specific fields:** The vulnerability is present in the 'event name' and 'description' fields within the "Add Events" functionality.
*  **Proof of Concept (POC):** A Google Drive link is provided as a POC.
*  **Recommendation:** Sanitization of input and usage of Content Security Policy(CSP) is suggested to mitigate the vulnerability.
