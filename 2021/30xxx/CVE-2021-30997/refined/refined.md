- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A S/MIME issue existed in the handling of encrypted email.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in the way the system handles encrypted S/MIME emails. Specifically, some MIME parts were being loaded automatically, which should not have been, leading to the disclosure of plaintext.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may be able to recover plaintext contents of an S/MIME-encrypted email.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through sending a specially crafted S/MIME encrypted email to a vulnerable device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send a malicious S/MIME encrypted email to the victim.
