  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-30995",
    "description": "This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Apple macOS. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the handling of directory paths. The code is subject to a time-of-check/time-of-use race condition when performing path validation. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges from low integrity and execute code in the context of root.",
