  "CVE-2021-30145": {
    "Description": "A format string vulnerability was found in mpv, potentially resulting in arbitrary code execution.\n\nmpv uses untrusted input within format strings.\n\nA remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted m3u playlist file using mpv, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.",
    "Root cause": "The mpv media player's custom protocol handler (mf://) uses untrusted input within format strings when merging multiple images into a video. Specifically, the `sprintf` function is used to process user-controlled format specifiers within the provided URL, allowing for a format string vulnerability.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Format string vulnerability due to use of `sprintf` with user-controlled input.",
      "Heap overflow due to lack of bounds checking with sprintf, leading to memory corruption."
    ],
    "Impact": "A remote attacker could entice a user to open a specially crafted m3u playlist file using mpv, possibly resulting in execution of arbitrary code with the privileges of the process or a Denial of Service condition.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Remote exploitation via a crafted m3u playlist file.",
      "The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a malicious playlist file containing a crafted `mf://` URL."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to entice a user to open a malicious playlist file (e.g., via a URL like http://10.0.0.1/evil.m3u) and may need detailed information about the victim's system to fine-tune the exploit.  The attacker needs to control the content of the playlist file served to the victim."
