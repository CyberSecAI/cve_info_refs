Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-30490:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of this vulnerability is overly permissive file permissions on the executable files used by the ViewPower service. Specifically, the service executable files are modifiable by "NT Authority/Authenticated Users," which means any user logged into the system can modify these files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure File Permissions:** The primary vulnerability is the presence of write permissions for authenticated users on the service's executable files.
*   **Service Executing with High Privileges:** The ViewPower service runs with elevated privileges, typically as "NT Authority/System." This amplifies the impact of the insecure file permissions.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** While not explicitly stated, the vulnerability relies on the fact that the service will execute whatever is in the modified executable. The service does not validate the integrity or origin of its executable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local, unprivileged user can modify the service's executable file to contain malicious code. When the service starts, or is restarted, it will execute the attacker's code with the elevated privileges of the service, granting the attacker system-level access ("NT Authority/System").
*   **Full System Control:** Once escalated to NT Authority/System, an attacker can create new administrator accounts, install backdoors, modify system settings, steal sensitive data, and take complete control of the compromised system.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The attacker can execute arbitrary commands with system privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attack vector requires local access to the machine where ViewPower is installed.
*   **File Modification:** The attacker needs to modify the service's executable file. This is achieved by replacing the original executable with a malicious one.
*   **Service Restart:** The service needs to be restarted for the malicious code to be executed. This can be done by manually restarting the service or rebooting the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** The attacker needs a valid user account on the Windows machine where ViewPower is installed.
*   **File Write Access:** The attacker leverages the write permissions granted to the Authenticated Users group on the service executable file.
*   **Basic Windows Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to use basic Windows commands to check service configurations (`services.msc`, `icacls`) and potentially how to generate a malicious executable (`msfvenom`).

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in multiple versions of ViewPower, including the standard and Pro editions.
*   The exploit is simple to perform using standard Windows command-line tools.
*   The vulnerability was discovered in April 2021 and was still present in the latest version (V1.04-21353) as of August 15, 2022.
*   Multiple ViewPower services were found to be vulnerable on the "Pro" edition.
