Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-30474:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error in the `aom_film_grain_table_lookup` function within the libaom library. Specifically, the cached end time of an entry was not used, leading to a heap-after-use error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Use-after-free: The code attempts to access memory that has already been freed.
- Heap-after-use error: Memory is freed and then accessed again after that.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: A malformed multimedia file processed by libaom can lead to a crash or other unexpected behavior due to the memory corruption.
- Unspecified impact: The advisory also mentions the possibility of other unspecified impacts beyond denial of service, suggesting the potential for more serious consequences if the vulnerability is exploited.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Processing a malformed AV1 multimedia file: The vulnerability is triggered when the libaom library attempts to decode or process a specially crafted or corrupted AV1 file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious AV1 file to a system using the vulnerable version of libaom. This could involve various attack scenarios, including:
    - Sending a malicious video file to a user.
    - Embedding the video file in a website or application that the user accesses.
    - Placing the file in a location where it will be processed by vulnerable software.
    - It can be exploited both locally and remotely.

**Additional details from the provided content**
- The fix for this vulnerability is in commit `6e31957b6dc62dbc7d1bb70cd84902dd14c4bf2e` which is described as "aom_dsp: Asan fix in aom_film_grain_table_lookup".
- Gentoo GLSA 202401-32 and Debian security advisories DSA-5490-1 and DLA-3556-1 address this vulnerability.
- The fix involves using the cached `end_time` of the entry to avoid the heap-after-use error.
