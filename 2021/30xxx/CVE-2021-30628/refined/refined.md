Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-30628:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Stack buffer overflow in ANGLE.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow. This means a buffer allocated on the stack can be written beyond its boundaries, overwriting adjacent memory regions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. The attacker could overwrite return addresses or other crucial data on the stack, redirecting program flow to execute their malicious code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is located in ANGLE, which is used for graphics rendering. An attacker could potentially trigger the overflow by crafting specific graphics data or commands processed by ANGLE.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the input data or graphics commands processed by the ANGLE library in order to trigger the overflow. This could be achieved through a crafted website, a malicious application, or other means of providing input to Chromium.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was reported by Jaehun Jeong(@n3sk) of Theori.
- This vulnerability was rated as high severity.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Chromium version 93.0.4577.82 and later.
