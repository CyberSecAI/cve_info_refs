Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-30151

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the Sidekiq web UI when handling queue names, specifically in the live-poll feature. The issue was present in the `web/views/_poll_link.erb` file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-provided queue names before including them in HTML output. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to various malicious activities:
  - Stealing user session cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious websites
  - Performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user
  - Displaying altered or misleading content to users of the Sidekiq web interface.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a malicious queue name containing JavaScript code and navigating to the `/sidekiq/queues` endpoint with the malicious queue name in the URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or influence the name of a queue to include malicious JavaScript.
- The attacker must also have access to the Sidekiq web interface.
- According to the report, Internet Explorer does not automatically encode the double quotes, making it more susceptible to this exploit with the given PoC than modern browsers that would encode it to `%22`.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects versions of Sidekiq up to and including v6.2 and v5.1.3.
- The issue was initially reported against version v5.1.3 and was later confirmed against the master branch, before a fix was implemented.
- A fix was implemented by adding a check to the input, effectively sanitizing the queue name.
