| I'm unable to reproduce an issue in Sidekiq v5.1.0. I found and fixed one inconsistency but I don't see how it can be exploited as it requires a queue with that name to have jobs in it. Please give more detailed steps or close the issue. |

| the payload I provided works against the latest version of master, I tested multiple setups, some only worked for IE and the other worked on all browsers, so I couldn't understand why,  If you have Internet Explorer you can open this link as a proof `[HOST]/sidekiq/queues/"><h1>@xhzeem`  The point is that modern browsers auto encode some characters to URL encoding which makes the `"` converts into `%22`but internet explorer doesn't do that you can see it there with no issue, even though I have another setup that is vulnerable and exploitable on chrome but I don't know why.  **PoC:** <https://d.top4top.io/p_19096xn861.png>  simply just use cURL and you will get it.  ``` curl 'https://[HOST]/sidekiq/queues/"onmouseover="alert()"' -H 'Authorization: Basic YWRtaW46QHhoemVlbQ==' ``` |

Package        : ruby-sidekiq
Version        : 5.2.3+dfsg-1+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-30151 CVE-2022-23837
Debian Bug     : 987354 1004193

ruby-sidekiq, a simple, efficient background processing for Ruby,
had a couple of vulnerabilities as follows:

CVE-2021-30151

    Sidekiq allows XSS via the queue name of the live-poll feature
    when Internet Explorer is used.

CVE-2022-23837

    In api.rb in Sidekiq, there is no limit on the number of days
    when requesting stats for the graph. This overloads the system,
    affecting the Web UI, and makes it unavailable to users.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
5.2.3+dfsg-1+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your ruby-sidekiq packages.

For the detailed security status of ruby-sidekiq please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/ruby-sidekiq>
