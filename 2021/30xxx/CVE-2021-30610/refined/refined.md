Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-30610:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Use-after-free in the Extensions API of Chromium.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A use-after-free vulnerability exists. This occurs when the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to unpredictable behavior and potential exploitation.

**Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation of a use-after-free vulnerability can lead to:
    - Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could potentially overwrite freed memory with malicious code and gain control of the application.
    - Application crash: The application may terminate unexpectedly when attempting to access freed memory.
    - Information disclosure: Sensitive information might be exposed if freed memory contains previously stored data.

**Attack vectors:**
    - The vulnerability is in the Extensions API of the Chromium browser, meaning that the vulnerability is reachable through the use of extensions.
    - A crafted extension could trigger the use-after-free.
    - A malicious website could potentially trigger the vulnerability by interacting with the vulnerable extension.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to install or have a malicious extension be run on a Chromium browser.
    - They may also be able to trigger the vulnerability through a malicious website if the attack can interact with the vulnerable extension.
