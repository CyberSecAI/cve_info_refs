**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input validation for the `imageFilePath` parameter in the `ImageServlet`. This parameter is used to retrieve locally stored images on the server, but it does not sanitize the provided path allowing for directory traversal.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application allows a user-supplied path to access files outside of the intended directory (`image` folder).
- Lack of Input Validation: The application does not validate or sanitize the `imageFilePath` parameter, allowing arbitrary file paths to be used.
- Unauthenticated Access: The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file read: An attacker can read any file on the server that the web application has access to. This could expose sensitive information, such as configuration files, system files, or user data.
- Information Disclosure: The attacker can gain access to sensitive information stored on the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: By sending a crafted GET request to the `/AvalancheWeb/image` endpoint with a malicious `imageFilePath` parameter, the attacker can retrieve files from the server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable Ivanti Avalanche server.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
