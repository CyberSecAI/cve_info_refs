Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-30535:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Double free in the International Components for Unicode (ICU) library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Double Free:** The vulnerability stems from a double free error in the ICU library. This occurs when memory that has already been freed is attempted to be freed again.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   The impact is not explicitly stated, but a double free can lead to memory corruption and potentially arbitrary code execution. This is especially impactful in a web browser like Chromium, as it could be exploited to execute malicious code on a user's system.
    
**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is through the processing of content that triggers the double free in the ICU library. The exact method to trigger it is not detailed but given the library's function it likely involves manipulation of text or international character processing.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would need to be able to provide specially crafted content that triggers the vulnerability. This can be achieved via malicious web pages or other resources loaded by the browser. The attacker does not need any special position on the network as the vulnerability exists in the client.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability was reported by nocma, leogan, and cheneyxu of WeChat Open Platform Security Team.
*   The fix for this vulnerability was included in Chrome version 91.0.4472.77.
*   This was a medium severity vulnerability and received a $1000 reward.
