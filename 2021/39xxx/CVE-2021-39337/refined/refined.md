   - This confirms that the content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**:
    *   The `job-portal` WordPress plugin suffers from insufficient input sanitization and output escaping in the `~/admin/jobs_function.php` file. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts via user-supplied parameters.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**:
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**: The plugin is vulnerable to Stored XSS, which means the malicious script injected by the attacker gets permanently stored in the database and is executed when an administrator accesses the affected plugin settings page.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**:
    *   An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious scripts, which may lead to unauthorized actions, data theft, or further compromise of the site.
*    **Attack Vectors:**
    *   An attacker with admin level access can inject the malicious javascript payload by navigating to `Jobs` > `Add New`,  and inserting the payload into the `Job Title` or `Company Name` fields.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**:
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
     *   This vulnerability affects multi-site installations where `unfiltered_html` is disabled for administrators, and sites where `unfiltered_html` is disabled.
