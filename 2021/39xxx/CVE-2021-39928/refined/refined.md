```
Root cause of vulnerability: The IEEE 802.11 dissector in Wireshark has a vulnerability that can cause a crash due to a NULL pointer exception.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: A NULL pointer dereference in the `dissect_wlan_radio_phdr` function within the IEEE 802.11 dissector.

Impact of exploitation: Exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) by crashing Wireshark.

Attack vectors: This vulnerability can be exploited either by injecting a malformed IEEE 802.11 packet onto the network or by opening a malformed packet capture file.

Required attacker capabilities/position: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious network traffic or create a malicious packet capture file, which then has to be opened by a victim using Wireshark.
