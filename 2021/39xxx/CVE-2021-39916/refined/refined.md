Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) in the API endpoint used for returning approval status from external status checks. Specifically, the `external_status_check_id` parameter in the API request is not properly validated or restricted to the specific project context, allowing an attacker to access information about status checks in other projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** The API does not properly authenticate/authorize the user's access to the external status check IDs being requested in the API calls. It allows a user to access status check information by simply changing the `external_status_check_id` parameter value, regardless of whether the user has permission to access said status check, or even is associated with the project containing said status check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can leak sensitive information about any external status check on the GitLab instance. This includes:
    *   Private project names and IDs
    *   Names of status checks
    *   Private URLs/addresses of external status check tools
    *   Names and IDs of protected branches linked to the status check
    *   Access rules for protected branches, which may reveal names of users with access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating the `external_status_check_id` parameter in the API request (`POST /projects/:id/merge_requests/:merge_request_iid/status_check_responses`).
*  **Leveraging a legitimate project:** The attacker has to create their own project, configure a status check in it and then create a merge request in this project in order to send a request to the vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GitLab Account:** The attacker needs a valid account on the GitLab instance.
*   **Basic API Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to use the GitLab API.
*   **Access to an Ultimate Trial:** While the feature is an Ultimate feature, a user can access it by starting a trial on GitLab.com. This allows an attacker with a regular account to exploit the vulnerability.
*  **Knowledge of the attack procedure:** The attacker needs to follow the steps to reproduce the attack, including creating their own project, a status check, merge request and obtaining an access token, to be able to send the malicious request.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the API endpoint responsible for setting the status of an external status check.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by any user with an account, even on the GitLab.com instance, if they start an Ultimate trial.
*   The leaked information can be used to gain further insight into private projects and their configurations, potentially leading to further exploitation.
