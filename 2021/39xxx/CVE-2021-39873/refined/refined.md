  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `error_description` parameter in the Bitbucket and GitHub OAuth callback URLs is vulnerable to content spoofing or text injection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsanitized user input in the `error_description` parameter allows for injection of arbitrary text."

    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary text, potentially including malicious links or deceptive messages, into the error message displayed to the user after OAuth authentication failures. This could lead to phishing attacks or other forms of social engineering.",

    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious URL and have a user click on it. The attacker also requires knowledge of the OAuth callback mechanism used by GitLab."
