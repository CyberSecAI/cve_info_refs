Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Nextcloud Mail application's image blocking mechanism failed to filter images with a relative protocol (e.g., `//example.com/image.jpg`). This allowed embedded images to load even when they should have been blocked for privacy reasons.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation or sanitization of image URLs within emails.
- Failure to correctly handle URLs with relative protocols, leading to a bypass of the intended image blocking functionality.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privacy Leakage:** When a user opens an email, the image loading can leak the read state of the email as well as the user's IP address to the server hosting the image. This bypasses the intended privacy protections of the email client.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker sends an email containing an image URL with a relative protocol (e.g., `//attacker.com/tracking.png`).
- When the victim views the email in the vulnerable Nextcloud Mail application, the image will be loaded, regardless of the image blocking being enabled, leaking information.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a user of a vulnerable Nextcloud Mail application.
- The attacker must be able to host an image on a server under their control to track whether the victim has opened the email.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in version 1.10.4 of the Nextcloud Mail application.
- The issue is related to how the application handles URLs that do not specify a protocol (http/https), often referred to as "protocol-relative" URLs.
- The vulnerability is considered low severity, primarily due to the limited impact of information disclosure.

The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description which is a placeholder, specifically regarding the root cause (relative protocol handling), the attack vector (embedded image with relative protocol in email) and the impact (privacy leakage through IP and read status).
