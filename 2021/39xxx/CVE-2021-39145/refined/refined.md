{
  "CVE-2021-39145": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in execution of arbitrary code loaded from a remote server.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Arbitrary code execution via unsafe deserialization.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "A remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system by manipulating the processed input stream.",
    "Attack vectors": "Manipulating the processed input stream to inject malicious objects.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to manipulate the input stream that is processed by XStream."
