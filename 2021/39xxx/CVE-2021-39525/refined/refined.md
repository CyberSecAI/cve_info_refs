The provided content is related to CVE-2021-39525.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `bit_read_fixed` function in `bits.c:1424`. This function is used for reading a fixed number of bits from a bitstream. The vulnerability occurs when the function attempts to copy more data into a buffer than allocated, leading to a heap overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow due to insufficient bounds checking in bit reading function.

**Impact of exploitation:** A successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted DWG file that contains specific bitstream patterns, forcing a larger than expected read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted DWG file to the vulnerable software.
