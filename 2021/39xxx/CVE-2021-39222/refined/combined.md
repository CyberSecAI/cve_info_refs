# XSS in Talk

Low

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-xhxq-f4vg-jw5g
Oct 25, 2021

## Package

Talk
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 10.0.7, < 10.1.4, < 11.1.2, < 11.2.0, < 12.0.0

## Patched versions

10.0.7, 10.1.4, 11.1.2, 11.2.0, 12.0.0

## Description

### Impact

The Nextcloud Talk application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab.

Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk application is upgraded to 10.0.7, 10.1.4, 11.1.2, 11.2.0 or 12.0.0.

### Workarounds

Use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy. You can find a list of supported browsers on [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/contentsecuritypolicy). A notable exemption is Internet Explorer which does not support CSP properly.
