# Unsafe inline XSS in pasting DOM element into chat

Low

[gabek](/gabek)
published
GHSA-2hfj-cxw7-g45p
Sep 26, 2021

## Package

chat.js
(n/a)

## Affected versions

0.0.8

## Patched versions

0.0.9

## Description

### Impact

Inline scripts are executed when Javascript is parsed via a paste action.

1. Open <https://watch.owncast.online/>
2. Copy and then paste `<img src=null onerror=alert('hello')>` into the

   chat field.
3. An alert should pop up.

### Patches

```
    ⋮ 13 │    // Content security policy
    ⋮ 14 │    csp := []string{
    ⋮ 15 │        "script-src 'self' 'sha256-2HPCfJIJHnY0NrRDPTOdC7AOSJIcQyNxzUuut3TsYRY='",
    ⋮ 16 │        "worker-src 'self' blob:", // No single quotes around blob:
    ⋮ 17 │    }

```

Will be patched in 0.0.9 by blocking `unsafe-inline` Content Security Policy and specifying the `script-src`. The `worker-src` is required to be set to `blob` for the video player.
