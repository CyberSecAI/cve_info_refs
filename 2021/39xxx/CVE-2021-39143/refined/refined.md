The provided content is a GitHub security advisory for a vulnerability in Spinnaker, identified as GHSA-34jx-3vmr-56v8, which is associated with CVE-2021-39143.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue that occurs during the extraction of TAR files by AppEngine for deployments. The utility used for extraction does not properly validate the paths within the TAR archive, allowing for potential file overwrites.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper path sanitization or validation when extracting files from a TAR archive. This allows an attacker to specify paths within the archive that can overwrite arbitrary files on the target system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can overwrite files on the container.
- This can potentially lead to a man-in-the-middle (MITM) type attack by replacing libraries or injecting wrapper files.
- This could compromise the application or the system it's running on.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker likely needs some level of access to the system to upload a malicious TAR archive.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious TAR file as part of a deployment process in AppEngine.
- The attacker needs to have low privileges, meaning a low-privileged user can exploit the issue.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is related to the `ArtifactUtils.java` file in the `clouddriver-appengine` module of the Spinnaker project.
- The impacted versions are <1.26.7, <1.25.7, and <1.24.7.
- Patches are available in versions 1.26.7, 1.25.7, and 1.24.7.
- The advisory suggests a workaround of disabling Google AppEngine deployments or artifacts that provide TARs.
- The severity of this vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 6.6.
- The CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H.
