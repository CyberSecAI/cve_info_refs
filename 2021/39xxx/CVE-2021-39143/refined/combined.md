# Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory ('Path Traversal') in spinnaker

Moderate

## Package

spinnaker

## Affected versions

<1.26.7, <1.25.7, <1.24.7

## Patched versions

1.26.7, 1.25.7, 1.24.7

## Description

### Impact

A path traversal vulnerability was discovered in uses of TAR files by AppEngine for deployments. This uses a utility to extract files locally for deployment without validating the paths in that deployment don't override system files. This would allow an attacker to override files on the container, POTENTIALLY introducing a MITM type attack vector by replacing libraries or injecting wrapper files.

### Patches

Incoming...

### Workarounds

Disable Google AppEngine deployments and/or disable artifacts that provide TARs.

### References

To be updated. Reference examples:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
