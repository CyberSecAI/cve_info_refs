# Guests can see name of the groups shared in projects

**[HackerOne report #447817](https://hackerone.com/reports/447817)** by ashish\_r\_padelkar on 2018-11-20:

**Summary:**
Hello,

There is no documentation for this i guess but i assume that `Developer` and lower level users can not see list of groups that is shared in projects at `https://gitlab.com/<Project>/project_members`

Here, they can only see individual members.

**Description:**

It is possible for users with `Developer` and lower level to see if the project is shared with groups

The endpoint responsible for this is `https://gitlab.com/autocomplete/project_groups.json?project_id=<ProjectID>`

This will list all the names of the group(even if private)

## Steps To Reproduce:

1. As a `Developer or lower level` role, visit `https://gitlab.com/<Project>/project_members` . You will not see groups that are shared in this project
2. Now using `https://gitlab.com/autocomplete/project_groups.json?project_id=<ProjectID>` , you can see the names!

## Supporting Material/References:

I found this endpoint in autocomplete dropdown in protected branch and protected tag at `/settings/repository` in `Allowed to merge` dropdown

Regards,
Ashish

## Impact

Guest can see groups shared in projects
