The provided content is related to a segmentation fault vulnerability in the `pdftools` project, specifically in the `textglyph.cpp` file. However, the CVE ID `CVE-2021-39542` is not mentioned in the content. The issue was reported as a bug and subsequently fixed. The commit message mentions `CVE-2024-56139` along with several other issues which may be related but it is not directly related to CVE-2021-39542

Based on the provided content:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A segmentation fault occurs due to a null pointer dereference when the `Font::Size()` function is called within the `TextGlyph::DoGlyph` function. This happens at `textglyph.cpp:35:32`. The root cause is that the `Font` object does not exist and is accessed directly.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Null pointer dereference, leading to a segmentation fault.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** Application crash (segmentation fault).
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a malformed PDF file that causes `TextGlyph::DoGlyph` to be called when the font has not been set, causing `Font::Size()` to be invoked on a null pointer.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a malformed PDF which triggers the vulnerability.
