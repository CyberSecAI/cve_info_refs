{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from a bypass in the enforcement of 2FA (Two-Factor Authentication) when using the `git` command for accessing GitLab repositories. While the web interface correctly redirects users to enable 2FA, the git command with username and password does not enforce this requirement, allowing access to repositories without 2FA.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "2FA bypass, broken access control",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass 2FA and gain unauthorized read and write access to repositories within a 2FA-enabled group. This allows them to potentially leak, modify, or push malicious code.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited through the `git` command using username and password authentication rather than the web interface.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be a member of a group that has 2FA enabled, have the necessary permissions to read and write to repositories within that group, and possess a valid username and password."
