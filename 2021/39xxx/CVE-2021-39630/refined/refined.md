Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-39630:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in how Android handles shell overlays during the boot process. Specifically, non-root shells were able to fabricate overlays, leading to potential security breaches.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unrestricted fabrication of shell overlays by non-root users.
- Ability for shell overlays created by non-root to remain after boot.
- Potential for unauthorized usage of the overlay fabrication API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Local Elevation of Privilege (EoP) is the primary impact, as a malicious application could bypass user interaction requirements to gain additional permissions.
- Non-root shells gaining capabilities they should not possess.
- Introduction of potentially broken overlays.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack: A malicious app on the device could exploit this vulnerability.
- The attack occurs during the boot process, taking advantage of the vulnerable overlay handling.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a local presence on the device, typically as a malicious app.
- No special execution privileges or user interaction are needed once the malicious application is installed.

**Additional Notes**

- The fix implemented blocks shell UID from fabricating overlays and clears shell overlays upon boot.
- All overlays created by packages with shell UID are removed on boot, preventing the use of broken overlays and unauthorized access.
- This vulnerability is categorized as High severity.
