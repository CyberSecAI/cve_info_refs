- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Category names can be used for XSS attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of category names, allowing malicious scripts to be embedded.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows for execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the category names, likely within a forum or similar platform where categories are displayed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to modify category names, typically a moderator privilege. Also the default Content Security Policy must have been modified or disabled in a way that makes the site more vulnerable to XSS attacks.
