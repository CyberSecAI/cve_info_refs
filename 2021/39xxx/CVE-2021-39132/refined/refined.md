Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization of YAML data within Rundeck. Specifically, the application was using the SnakeYAML library to parse YAML configuration files without proper restrictions on the types of objects that could be deserialized.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization (CWE-502):** The core weakness is the lack of type restriction during YAML deserialization. This allowed an attacker to inject malicious YAML payloads that, when deserialized, could instantiate arbitrary Java objects, leading to remote code execution.
*   The application failed to restrict the deserialization to only the `PluginMeta` type, using the `loadAs` method of the SnakeYaml library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the Rundeck server. This could lead to complete compromise of the server and the data it manages, including the possibility of further lateral movement into connected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Plugin Upload:** An attacker could upload a crafted zip-format plugin containing a malicious `plugin.yaml` file.
*   **Crafted ACL Policy Yaml Upload:** An attacker could upload a crafted aclpolicy yaml file, either directly or within an untrusted project archive.
*   **Unauthorized POST request:** An authenticated user could make a POST request with a crafted YAML payload (Rundeck Enterprise only)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
*   **Authorization (Plugin/ACL Yaml):** For the plugin and ACL policy yaml upload vectors, the attacker needs specific authorization levels:
    *   `admin` level access to the `system` resource type for the plugin upload.
    *   `create`, `update`, or `admin` level access to a `project_acl` or `system_acl` resource for the ACL policy yaml upload.
*   **Authorization (POST Request):** For the unauthorized POST request, the attacker needs only to be an authenticated user.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability affects Rundeck Community and Enterprise editions.
*   The fix implemented in the commit restricts the yaml deserialization to the `PluginMeta` type using `SingleTypeConstructor`.
*   The provided github content also contains test cases added to prevent future occurences of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is associated with the GHSA-q4rf-3fhx-88pf GitHub Security Advisory.
