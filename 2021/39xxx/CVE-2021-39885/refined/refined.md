Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39885:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input when displaying approval rule names within the merge request creation page. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize the "name" field of an "Approval rule" before rendering it in the "Reviewers" dropdown.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** A malicious user can inject arbitrary JavaScript code within the "Approval rule" name field. This payload is stored in the database.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input when rendering the approval rule name on the merge request creation page, allowing for the execution of malicious scripts.
*   **CSP Bypass:** The provided iframe-based payload was able to bypass the Content Security Policy (CSP) in place on the platform at the time of the report.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser session.
*   **Data Theft:** This can lead to stealing of sensitive information such as cookies, session tokens, and other user data.
*   **Account Takeover:** Attackers can potentially use the XSS to generate and exfiltrate access tokens, which could lead to account compromise.
*   **Malicious Actions:** Arbitrary code execution can be used to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of the victim user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Approval Rule Creation:** An attacker with the ability to create or modify approval rules can inject the malicious payload into the "name" field of an approval rule.
*   **Victim Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when a victim user visits the merge request creation page, specifically when they open the "Reviewers" dropdown, which displays the malicious approval rule name.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have the ability to create or modify approval rules. This typically requires a premium subscription or higher in GitLab.
*   The attacker needs to create a project and invite the victim user to it with sufficient permissions to view merge requests.
*   The attacker must craft an XSS payload within the "Approval rule" name field to be executed in the victim's browser.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported through HackerOne.
*   The provided report includes detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability, including screenshots.
*   The vulnerability was confirmed to affect GitLab.com.
*   The report highlights the ability to bypass the CSP of Gitlab.com using a specific payload.
