{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `do_mkd` function in `ftpproto.c` uses `sprintf` to construct a string, which does not perform bounds checking, leading to a buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer overflow due to use of `sprintf` without bounds checking."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can overwrite the return address (rbp) on the stack, leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a new path name provided to the `do_mkd` function exceeds the buffer size (1024 bytes).",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a malicious FTP command (`MKD`) with a long path name as argument."
