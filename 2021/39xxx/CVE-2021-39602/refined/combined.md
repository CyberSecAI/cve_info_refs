| Buffer overflow exists in the `do_mkd` function in the `ftpproto.c` file. Overwrite rbp when new path name length exceeds 1032.  ``` #define MAX_BUFFER_SIZE 1024        //it defined in common.h  char buf[MAX_BUFFER_SIZE] = {0};    //buf[1024]={0} sprintf(buf, "\"%s/%s\" created",buf,sess->arg);  ``` |

| Hi [@Gabe-commiter](https://github.com/Gabe-commiter), To fix this issue, you can you `snprintf()` instead of `sprintf()` to limit maximun bytes that are read into buffer. For detail:  ``` int snprintf(char *str, size_t size, const char *format, ...);  *str : is a buffer. size : is the maximum number of bytes (characters) that will be written to the buffer. format : C string that contains a format string that follows the same specifications as format in printf ... : the optional ( …) arguments  are just the string formats like (“%d”, myint) as seen in printf.  ``` |
