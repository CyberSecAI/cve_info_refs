Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39872:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A fix for LDAP user authentication introduced a regression, allowing users with expired passwords to bypass the intended restrictions. Previously, patches had been implemented to block API and GraphQL access for users with expired passwords, but this new fix inadvertently re-enabled access through these methods.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Password Expiration Enforcement:** The system fails to properly enforce password expiration for API and Git access via tokens.
- **Regression:** A previous fix intended to block access for users with expired passwords was unintentionally reversed due to a faulty patch aimed at addressing LDAP authentication issues.
- **Token Bypass:** Users with expired passwords can still use their tokens to access the API (REST and GraphQL) and Git.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Users whose passwords have expired and should be denied access can gain full access to the API (both REST and GraphQL) and Git repositories through tokens.
- **Data Exposure:**  Expired password users could potentially access, modify, or exfiltrate sensitive data they should no longer have access to.
- **Security Breach:** The failure to enforce password expiration creates a significant security vulnerability, potentially leading to data breaches.

**Attack vectors:**
- **API Access:** The vulnerability is exploited by making API requests (REST and GraphQL) using the user's personal access token.
- **Git Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by accessing Git repositories using the user's personal access token.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Valid User Account:** An attacker needs a valid user account on the affected GitLab instance.
- **Expired Password:** The user's password needs to be set as expired by an administrator.
- **Personal Access Token:** The attacker needs a previously generated personal access token for the user account.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects self-hosted GitLab instances, specifically tested on version 14.1.0.
- The issue was previously mitigated in versions 13.12.2 and 14.0.2, but a subsequent fix for LDAP authentication re-introduced the vulnerability.
- The expected behavior is that users with expired passwords should be blocked from accessing the API and Git, receiving a "403 Forbidden" error, as was the case before the regression.
