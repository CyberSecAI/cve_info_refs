The provided content details a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability in the `sela` project, specifically within the `sela_file.cpp` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `file::SelaFile::readFromFile` function at line 78, column 67, when reading data from a file. This indicates that the function is attempting to read or write beyond the allocated buffer size on the heap.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The core issue is a heap-based buffer overflow, which can be triggered by a crafted input file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a program crash, as indicated by the AddressSanitizer output.
- In a more severe scenario, it could potentially be exploited for arbitrary code execution, although the provided crash does not demonstrate it.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by providing a specially crafted file to the `sela` program.
- The program takes the file as a command line argument and processes it using `file::SelaFile::readFromFile`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file to the vulnerable application to trigger the overflow.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute the `sela` binary with the crafted file as input.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the process of reading a file.
- The AddressSanitizer output provides a detailed call stack of the function calls leading to the overflow.
- A proof of concept (POC) file (`heap-overflow-readFromFile-sela_file-78.zip`) is provided, which can be used to reproduce the vulnerability.
