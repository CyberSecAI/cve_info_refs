- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) and session fixation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The document does not specify the impact of the vulnerabilities, but typically, XSS can lead to the execution of malicious scripts in a user's browser, while session fixation can allow an attacker to hijack a user's session.
- **Attack vectors**: The document does not specify the attack vectors, but XSS vulnerabilities are typically exploited by injecting malicious scripts into web pages, and session fixation attacks involve manipulating session identifiers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The document does not provide specific details, but typically exploiting XSS requires the ability to inject malicious content into the application, and session fixation requires the ability to influence session identifiers.
