Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the `ResetUserInfo.php` page of openSIS version 8.0. This occurs when MySQL (MariaDB) is used as the application database. The `password_stn_id` parameter is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user input (`password_stn_id` parameter), allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.
- Time-based Blind SQL Injection: The provided exploit uses a time-based blind SQL injection technique, which is used when the results of the query are not displayed to the user but execution time is affected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands on the MySQL (MariaDB) database, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration: Accessing sensitive information such as user credentials, student data, or other confidential data stored in the database.
  - Data modification: Altering or deleting data within the database.
  - Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining administrative access or compromising the entire system.
  - System disruption: Causing the application to malfunction or become unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is a web request to the vulnerable `ResetUserInfo.php` page.
- The vulnerable parameter `password_stn_id` is passed via a POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the target server.
- The attacker does not require any prior authentication.
- Knowledge of the vulnerable parameter and the SQL injection technique is required.

**Technical Details from the Exploit:**
- The provided `sqlmap` command demonstrates a time-based blind SQL injection technique, using `BENCHMARK` and `MD5` to induce delays in the database response.
- The `sqlmap` output indicates the back-end DBMS is MySQL (MariaDB fork).
- The vulnerable `password_stn_id` parameter is located in a POST request.
- The vulnerable PHP page is `ResetUserInfo.php`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is specific to openSIS version 8.0 when used with MySQL/MariaDB
- The vulnerability was discovered by Nathan Johnson in August 2021.
