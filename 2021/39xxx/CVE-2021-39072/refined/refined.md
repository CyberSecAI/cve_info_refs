Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39072:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a missing HTTP Strict-Transport-Security (HSTS) header in IBM Security Guardium.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing HSTS Header:** The lack of an HSTS header allows a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacker to potentially downgrade a secure HTTPS connection to HTTP, exposing the user to eavesdropping and other attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Downgrade Attack:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to force the client to use an insecure HTTP connection instead of HTTPS.
- **Eavesdropping:** An attacker could intercept and read sensitive data transmitted between the user and the Guardium server.
- **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could potentially manipulate the data being transmitted.
- **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could steal session cookies and impersonate legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the user and the Guardium server.
- **Network Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious code into the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user and the affected IBM Security Guardium instance.
- **MitM Positioning:** The attacker needs to be in a network position that enables them to perform a Man-in-the-Middle attack, such as being on the same network or controlling network infrastructure.
