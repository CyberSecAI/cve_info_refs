Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the NetModule router software's handling of session tokens (cookies). The software does not generate a new session token upon login or logout, and it accepts arbitrary values for the session token cookie ("PHPSESSID").

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Session Fixation:** The web interface does not invalidate or regenerate session tokens upon login or logout.
*   **Acceptance of Arbitrary Session Tokens:** The application accepts any value for the session cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker can perform session hijacking or takeover by pre-setting a known session cookie on the victim's browser. If a victim logs into the system, the attacker will use this pre-set token to gain access. This would allow an attacker to impersonate a legitimate user and gain access to the web interface of the NetModule router.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP Response Splitting:** An attacker could inject a malicious cookie header to set a session identifier.
*   **Malware:** Malware on the victim's machine could be used to set a session token in the browser.
*   **Physical Access:** Direct access to the victim's computer could allow an attacker to manually set the session cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to influence the victim's browser to set the malicious "PHPSESSID" cookie. This could be done via network attacks, malware, or physical access.
*   The attacker does not need to know the victim's actual password or login credentials as they are hijacking an existing session.

**Additional Information:**
*   The affected software is NetModule Router Software (NRSW) versions before 4.3.0.113, 4.4.0.111, and 4.5.0.105.
*   The vulnerability is addressed in versions 4.3.0.113, 4.4.0.111, and 4.5.0.105.
*   The session token is stored in a cookie named "PHPSESSID".
