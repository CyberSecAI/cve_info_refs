Summary : A remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility
Description :
Fetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended
for use over on-demand TCP/IP links, like SLIP or PPP connections.
Fetchmail supports every remote-mail protocol currently in use on the
Internet (POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, all IMAPs, ESMTP ETRN, IPv6,
and IPSEC) for retrieval. Then Fetchmail forwards the mail through
SMTP so you can read it through your favorite mail client.

Install fetchmail if you need to retrieve mail over SLIP or PPP
connections.

Subject: ANNOUNCE: fetchmail security announcement 2021-02 (CVE-2021-39272) -
 TLS bypass vulnerabilities ("NO STARTTLS")

fetchmail-SA-2021-02: STARTTLS session encryption bypassing

Topics:		fetchmail fails to enforce an encrypted connection

Author:		Matthias Andree
Version:	0.9
Announced:	2021-08-26
Type:		failure to enforce configured security policy
Impact:		fetchmail continues an unencrypted connection,
		thus reading unauthenticated input and sending
		information unencrypted over its transport
Danger:		medium
Acknowledgment:	Andrew C. Aitchison for reporting this against fetchmail
		Damian Poddebniak, Fabian Ising, Hanno Böck, and Sebastian
		Schinzel for their Usenix Security 21 paper NO STARTTLS

CVE Name:	CVE-2021-39272
URL:		<https://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-SA-2021-02.txt>
Project URL:	<https://www.fetchmail.info/>

Affects:	- fetchmail releases up to and including 6.4.21

Not affected:	- fetchmail releases 6.4.22 and newer

Corrected in:	2021-08-26	fetchmail 6.4.22.rc1 release candidate
		TBD		fetchmail 6.4.22 release tarball

0. History of this announcement
===============================

2021-08-10	Andrew C. Aitchison contacts fetchmail maintainer with pointer
		to Usenix Security 21 paper by Damian Poddebniak et al.
2021-08-16	a simplified recommendation to configure --ssl where possible
		(see section 3b. below) to mitigate impact was sent to the
		 fetchmail mailing lists
2021-08-26 0.9	initial release along with fetchmail 6.4.22.rc1

1. Background
=============

fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP3, IMAP,
ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents. fetchmail supports SSL and TLS security layers
through the OpenSSL library, if enabled at compile time and if also
enabled at run time, in both SSL/TLS-wrapped mode on dedicated ports as
well as in-band-negotiated "STARTTLS" and "STLS" modes through the
regular protocol ports.

2. Problem description and Impact
=================================

fetchmail permits requiring that an IMAP or POP3 protocol exchange uses
a TLS-encrypted transport, in 6.4 by way of an --sslproto auto or similar
configuration.
  This TLS encryption can be established either as Implicit TLS connection,
which negotiates TLS first, or as a STARTTLS which starts as cleartext
protocol exchange that gets upgraded in the same TCP stream to TLS.

Without special configuration, fetchmail would opportunistically try to
upgrade cleartext connections to TLS by STARTTLS, but allow cleartext protocol
exchange, which is documented.

IMAP also supports sessions that start in "authenticated state" (PREAUTH).
In this latter case, IMAP (RFC-3501) does not permit sending STARTTLS
negotiations, which are only permissible in not-authenticated state.
  In such a combination of circumstances (1. IMAP protocol in use, 2. the
server greets with PREAUTH, announcing authenticated state, 3. the user
configured TLS mandatory, 4. the user did not configure "ssl" mode that uses
separate ports for Implicit SSL/TLS), fetchmail 6.4.21 and older would
not encrypt the session.

There was a similar situation for POP3: if the remote name contained
@compuserve.com, and if the server supported a non-standard "AUTH" command
without mechanism argument and if it responded with a list that contained "RPA"
(also in mixed or lower case), then fetchmail would not attempt STARTTLS.
While the password itself is then protected by the RPA scheme (which employs
MD5 however), fetchmail 6.4.21 and older would not encrypt the session.

Also, a configuration containing --auth ssh (meaning that fetchmail should not
authenticate, on the assumption that the session will be pre-authenticated for
instance through SSH running a mail server with --plugin, or TLS client
certificates), would also defeat STARTTLS as result of an implementation defect.
This affected both POP3 and IMAP.

3. Solutions
============

PREFACE: distributors backporting fixes to old versions are asked to diff the
manual page and review the changes, and the NEWS file, because the manual page
has been updated with newer recommendations.  The same backport recommendations
hold for the README.SSL file.

3a. Install fetchmail 6.4.22 or newer.

The fetchmail source code is available from
<<https://sourceforge.net/projects/fetchmail/files/>>.

The Git-based source code repository is currently published via
<https://gitlab.com/fetchmail/fetchmail/-/tree/legacy_64> (primary)
<https://sourceforge.net/p/fetchmail/git/ci/legacy_64/tree/> (copy)

3b. Where the IMAP or POP3 server supports this form of access,
fetchmail can be configured to use Implicit TLS, called "ssl" mode, meaning it
will connect to a dedicated port (default: 993 for IMAP, 995 for POP3) and
negotiate TLS without prior clear-text protocol exchange.
  Also, --ssl can be given on the command line, which switches all
configured server statements to this Implicit TLS mode.

# NO STARTTLS

## Why TLS is better without STARTTLS A Security Analysis of STARTTLS in the Email Context

by Damian Poddebniak¹, Fabian Ising¹, Hanno Böck², and Sebastian Schinzel¹

## Introduction

Connections between email clients and servers provide two ways to be protected with TLS: While implicit TLS
encrypts the connection from the start and runs on a separate port, STARTTLS
provides a mechanism to upgrade existing unencrypted connections to TLS.

Sometimes STARTTLS is seen as an opportunistic encryption mode that provides TLS protection
only when available. This is trivially vulnerable to downgrade attacks. However, modern email clients
usually have the expectation that STARTTLS is enforced, and when enabled, no unencrypted communication
is possible.

Upgrading connections via STARTTLS is fragile and vulnerable to a number of security
vulnerabilities and attacks. We found more than 40 vulnerabilities in STARTTLS implementations. We
conclude that these vulnerabilities are so common that we recommend
avoiding using STARTTLS when possible.

## Attacks

We assume a Meddler-in-the-Middle (MitM) attacker who can modify connections established between an
email client and the email server of a provider.

### Stealing Login Credentials with SMTP and IMAP via Command Injection

In 2011 Postfix developer Wietse Venema [described a bug
in STARTTLS implementations](http://www.postfix.org/CVE-2011-0411.html) that allowed
injecting plaintext commands that a server interprets as if they were part of the
encrypted connection. This works by sending additional commands with the STARTTLS command to the
server in the same TCP segment.

We found that despite being known since 2011, this vulnerability is still very common. We found
15 vulnerable implementations, and in scans, 2% of all mail servers showed this vulnerability.

This command injection can be used to steal credentials with the SMTP and IMAP protocols.

Our attack requires a Meddler in the Middle (MitM) attacker that can modify network traffic and has
login credentials for their own account on the same server. The attacker can inject commands
that authenticate them and then start sending (SMTP) or storing (IMAP) an email.
The login credentials sent by the victim will be stored in the email that the attacker
can access.

The command injection can also be used for a cross-protocol attack to serve HTTPS content with
the mail server's certificate. Detailed descriptions of these attacks can be found in our paper.

### Mailbox content forgery via Response Injection

We discovered an attack similar to the command injection in email client applications.
We call this a response injection.
This bug affected many popular mail clients, including Apple Mail, Mozilla Thunderbird, Claws Mail, and
Mutt.

By injecting additional content to the server message in response to the STARTTLS command before the TLS
handshake,
we can inject server commands that the client will process as if they were part of the encrypted connection.
This
can be used to forge mailbox content.

### IMAP connection downgrade via PREAUTH and credential-stealing with REFERRAL

In the IMAP protocol, a server can signal the client in the first message that it is already authenticated
via
the PREAUTH command. The protocol forbids using the STARTTLS command in an authenticated state. Therefore, if
a client application accepts PREAUTH, it cannot enforce STARTTLS.

A Meddler in the Middle attacker can use this to prevent STARTTLS from upgrading the connection and force
a client to an unencrypted connection.

This vulnerability was originally [found in
Trojitá in 2014](http://jkt.flaska.net/blog/Trojita_0_4_1__a_security_update_for_CVE_2014_2567.html). We discovered that multiple other
email client applications were vulnerable to the same bug.

This bug is especially severe in combination with the IMAP features [Login Referrals](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2221) and [Mailbox Referrals](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2193).
These commands allow a server to instruct a client to log into another IMAP server. By using PREAUTH to
prevent an encrypted connection, an attacker can use referrals to force a client to send credentials to an
attacker-controlled server.
Fortunately, the referral features are not supported by many clients.
We found only one client - Alpine - vulnerable to this combination of PREAUTH and referrals.

### Additional Attacks

We found additional attacks, whose security impact may vary for implementations.
Please see our paper to learn more about these attacks.

## Conclusion

All vulnerabilities described here rely on the transition of an insecure connection to a
secure connection.
Implicit TLS does not have such a transition and is therefore not vulnerable to any of these attacks.
We therefore consider implicit TLS a more secure option than STARTTLS.

We also point out that STARTTLS always introduces at least one extra connection
round trip. So implicit TLS generally provides better performance.

## Impact

The demonstrated attacks require an active attacker and may be recognized when
used against an email client that tries to enforce the transition to TLS.
We have informed all popular email client and server vendors and most issues are already
fixed.
We think that the demonstrated attacks would be difficult to execute on a large scale, and we
primarily expect them to be used in targeted attacks.
As a general recommendation, you should always update your software and (to also profit from faster
connections)
reconfigure your email client to use implicit TLS only (see below).

## Recommendations

### For Email Client Users

If possible, we recommend that users check and configure their email clients to use SMTP, POP3 and IMAP with
implicit TLS on dedicated ports, i.e., SMTP/Submission on port 465, POP3 on port 995, and IMAP on port 993.
This is in line with already existing recommendations in
[RFC 8314](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8314#section-3) and was already recommended
by [security professionals](https://www.agwa.name/blog/post/starttls_considered_harmful) before.

Some mail service providers, notably Microsoft and Apple, do not support implicit TLS for SMTP/Submission.
We recommend that users ask their mail service providers to offer the more secure implicit TLS option.

### For Application Developers

Both email server and client applications should offer implicit TLS by default.
In the long term, software developers may decide to not support STARTTLS at all and thus simplify both
their code and configuration dialogs and files.

We recommend auditing all applications supporting STARTTLS - both on the server and the client side -
for the bugs discovered.
Most importantly, applications need to ensure that no unencrypted content gets processed as part of an
encrypted connection.
IMAP applications must make sure that they do not allow PREAUTH in combination with STARTTLS.
We provide the [EAST toolkit](https://github.com/fhms-its/EAST), which allows testing
applications.

### For Mail Server Administrators

Make sure your server supports implicit TLS for all supported protocols.
If possible, consider disabling STARTTLS for IMAP, POP3 and SMTP submission.

If you really need to support STARTTLS, we recommend testing your server with our tool for the command
injection vulnerability for all supported protocols.
If your server software is vulnerable, you should ask your vendor for a security update.

## FAQ

### Isn't STARTTLS insecure anyway?

STARTTLS is used in two "modes", "opportunistic", and "enforced".
Email clients must authenticate themselves with a username and password before submitting a new email or
accessing existing emails.
For these connections, the transition to TLS via STARTTLS **must** be strictly enforced because a
downgrade would reveal the username and password and give an attacker full access to the email account.

### How can I test if my software is vulnerable?

We provide the [EAST toolkit](https://github.com/fhms-its/EAST) that allows testing email clients
and servers.

**Testing an email server** for the command injection is relatively easy with our [Command Injection Tester](https://github.com/Email-Analysis-Toolkit/command-injection-tester).
[testssl.sh](https://github.com/drwetter/testssl.sh) (dev version) and
[TLS-Attacker](https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Attacker/tree/starttls)/[TLS-Scanner](https://github.com/tls-attacker/TLS-Scanner/tree/starttls) (starttls branch) also check for the command injection.

**Testing an email client** is more complex, and we refer to EAST's [Fake Mail Server](https://github.com/Email-Analysis-Toolkit/fake-mail-server) component.

### Are other protocols with support for STARTTLS or similar mechanisms affected?

We expect to see similar vulnerabilities in other protocols using STARTTLS, e.g., XMPP, FTP, IRC, or LDAP.
Thus, our recommendation to avoid STARTTLS and use implicit TLS when possible applies to those protocols as
well.
We encourage security researchers to look for such vulnerabilities in other protocols.

Some protocols only support STARTTLS and provide no implicit TLS mechanism.
We recommend that standards bodies define implicit TLS modes for these protocols and that future protocols
do this by default and avoid STARTTLS completely.

### What about communication between email servers (MTA to MTA)?

Traditionally, STARTTLS between email servers only protects against passive attacks and is vulnerable to
active attacks such as STARTTLS stripping.
Thus STARTTLS vulnerabilities do not give an advantage to the attacker.

However, efforts like [MTA-STS](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8461) and [DANE](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7671) provide authentication mechanisms for MTA
to MTA connections.
Therefore, server software should be investigated for STARTTLS vulnerabilities as well.
Particularly relevant are the buffering bugs, which can happen both for the sending (response injection) and
receiving (command injection) side of a mail server.
We have found and reported some vulnerabilities in server software during our research.

Currently, there is no standardized way to use implicit TLS for MTA to MTA connections.
Therefore, it is not possible to avoid STARTTLS without changes to the protocol specification.

### Email Servers

We found 320.000 vulnerable email servers in an Internet-wide scan and conducted a coordinated disclosure
involving different CERTs.
It is impracticable to inform and keep track of the update process of all mail service providers on the
Internet, and thus we identified and prioritized popular mail service
providers.
We only list these in the following table.

Server issues are generally more severe than client issues.
Unfortunately, no client configuration prevents server issues from being exploited, not even the usage of
implicit TLS.
Thus, you must ensure that your server (or your mail service provider) is not affected by STARTTLS issues.

You can use our [command\_injection\_tester tool](https://github.com/Email-Analysis-Toolkit/command-injection-tester) to verify that your server is not affected by the
most severe issue.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-ddefbdbb46
2021-09-24 20:31:06.232150
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : fetchmail
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 6.4.22
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <http://www.fetchmail.info/>
Summary : A remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility
Description :
Fetchmail is a remote mail retrieval and forwarding utility intended
for use over on-demand TCP/IP links, like SLIP or PPP connections.
Fetchmail supports every remote-mail protocol currently in use on the
Internet (POP2, POP3, RPOP, APOP, KPOP, all IMAPs, ESMTP ETRN, IPv6,
and IPSEC) for retrieval. Then Fetchmail forwards the mail through
SMTP so you can read it through your favorite mail client.

Install fetchmail if you need to retrieve mail over SLIP or PPP
connections.

Hash: SHA512
fetchmail-SA-2021-02: STARTTLS session encryption bypassing
Topics: fetchmail fails to enforce an encrypted connection
Author: Matthias Andree
Version: 1.0
Announced: 2021-08-26 (0.9), 2021-09-13 (1.0)
Type: failure to enforce configured security policy
Impact: fetchmail continues an unencrypted connection,
thus reading unauthenticated input and sending
information unencrypted over its transport
Danger: medium
Acknowledgment: Andrew C. Aitchison for reporting this against fetchmail
Damian Poddebniak, Fabian Ising, Hanno Böck, and Sebastian
Schinzel for their Usenix Security 21 paper NO STARTTLS
CVE Name: CVE-2021-39272
URL: https://www.fetchmail.info/fetchmail-SA-2021-02.txt
Project URL: https://www.fetchmail.info/
Affects: - fetchmail releases up to and including 6.4.21
Not affected: - fetchmail releases 6.4.22 and newer
Corrected in: 2021-09-13 fetchmail 6.4.22 release tarball
0. History of this announcement
===============================
2021-08-10 Andrew C. Aitchison contacts fetchmail maintainer with pointer
to Usenix Security 21 paper by Damian Poddebniak et al.
2021-08-16 a simplified recommendation to configure --ssl where possible
(see section 3b. below) to mitigate impact was sent to the
fetchmail mailing lists
2021-08-26 0.9 initial release along with fetchmail 6.4.22.rc1
2021-08-27 0.9.1 update references to 6.4.22.rc2.
2021-08-29 0.9.2 update references to 6.4.22.rc3 and correct 0.9.1 date.
2021-09-13 1.0 remove reference to rc3 from "corrected in" and bump v. to 1.0.
1. Background
=============
fetchmail is a software package to retrieve mail from remote POP3, IMAP,
ETRN or ODMR servers and forward it to local SMTP, LMTP servers or
message delivery agents. fetchmail supports SSL and TLS security layers
through the OpenSSL library, if enabled at compile time and if also
enabled at run time, in both SSL/TLS-wrapped mode on dedicated ports as
well as in-band-negotiated "STARTTLS" and "STLS" modes through the
regular protocol ports.
2. Problem description and Impact
=================================
fetchmail permits requiring that an IMAP or POP3 protocol exchange uses
a TLS-encrypted transport, in 6.4 by way of an --sslproto auto or similar
configuration.
This TLS encryption can be established either as Implicit TLS connection,
which negotiates TLS first, or as a STARTTLS which starts as cleartext
protocol exchange that gets upgraded in the same TCP stream to TLS.
Without special configuration, fetchmail would opportunistically try to
upgrade cleartext connections to TLS by STARTTLS, but allow cleartext protocol
exchange, which is documented.
IMAP also supports sessions that start in "authenticated state" (PREAUTH).
In this latter case, IMAP (RFC-3501) does not permit sending STARTTLS
negotiations, which are only permissible in not-authenticated state.
In such a combination of circumstances (1. IMAP protocol in use, 2. the
server greets with PREAUTH, announcing authenticated state, 3. the user
configured TLS mandatory, 4. the user did not configure "ssl" mode that uses
separate ports for Implicit SSL/TLS), fetchmail 6.4.21 and older would
not encrypt the session.
There was a similar situation for POP3: if the remote name contained
@compuserve.com, and if the server supported a non-standard "AUTH" command
without mechanism argument and if it responded with a list that contained "RPA"
(also in mixed or lower case), then fetchmail would not attempt STARTTLS.
While the password itself is then protected by the RPA scheme (which employs
MD5 however), fetchmail 6.4.21 and older would not encrypt the session.
Also, a configuration containing --auth ssh (meaning that fetchmail should not
authenticate, on the assumption that the session will be pre-authenticated for
instance through SSH running a mail server with --plugin, or TLS client
certificates), would also defeat STARTTLS as result of an implementation defect.
This affected both POP3 and IMAP.
3. Solutions
============
PREFACE: distributors backporting fixes to old versions are asked to diff the
manual page and review the changes, and the NEWS file, because the manual page
has been updated with newer recommendations. The same backport recommendations
hold for the README.SSL file.
3a. Install fetchmail 6.4.22 or newer.
The fetchmail source code is available from
.
The Git-based source code repository is currently published via
https://gitlab.com/fetchmail/fetchmail/-/tree/legacy\_64 (primary)
https://sourceforge.net/p/fetchmail/git/ci/legacy\_64/tree/ (copy)
3b. Where the IMAP or POP3 server supports this form of access,
fetchmail can be configured to use Implicit TLS, called "ssl" mode, meaning it
will connect to a dedicated port (default: 993 for IMAP, 995 for POP3) and
negotiate TLS without prior clear-text protocol exchange.
Also, --ssl can be given on the command line, which switches all
configured server statements to this Implicit TLS mode.
