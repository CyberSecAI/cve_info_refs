  "CVE-2021-39868": {
    "related_content": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability allows an attacker to create a project with an unlimited repository size by manipulating the project import function.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The project import function in GitLab allows users to import project data from an exported file. By modifying the `repository_size_limit` value in the project.json file within the exported archive to 0, an attacker can bypass the configured size limit and create a project with unlimited repository size.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Improper input validation during project import",
        "Missing check or sanitization of `repository_size_limit` during import."
      ],
       "impact": "An attacker, even with low-level privileges, can create a project with an unlimited repository size, potentially leading to resource exhaustion and denial of service (DoS) scenarios.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Manipulating the `project.json` file within a GitLab project export archive.",
        "Importing the modified archive back into GitLab using the project import feature."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs a low-level privileged account in GitLab to utilize the import project function."
    },
    "remediation": "The proposed solution involves excluding the `repository_size_limit` attribute during project import and relying on default or inherited configurations. Specific steps include adding `:repository_size_limit` to `excluded_attributes.project` in `lib/gitlab/import_export/project/import_export.yml` and removing `:repository_size_limit` from `:Project` in `spec/lib/gitlab/import_export/safe_model_attributes.yml`."
