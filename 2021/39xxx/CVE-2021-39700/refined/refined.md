The commit message indicates a change in SELinux policy related to `adb`, suggesting a possible information disclosure issue, which aligns with the provided CVE description that indicates that this CVE is an information disclosure issue.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker with `adb` access could potentially gain sensitive network information, potentially leading to further attacks or exploitation. This could reveal what ports are listening on the device and which IP address are being communicated with.

*  **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector involves an attacker gaining `adb` access to the Android device.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have `adb` access to the device, which typically means they must have developer mode enabled or some other means of gaining shell access.
