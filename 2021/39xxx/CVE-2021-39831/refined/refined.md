Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-39831:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds write, which allows writing data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution. This allows an attacker to potentially execute malicious code on the victim's machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L) or network-based (AV:N), and requires User Interaction (UI:R), meaning the user has to perform some action for the exploit to work.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker can be local or remote, but needs to convince a user to perform some action for the exploit to work. No privileges are needed (PR:N).
