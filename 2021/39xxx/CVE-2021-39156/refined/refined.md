Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-39156:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from how Istio handles URI paths containing fragments (the part of a URI after the `#` symbol).  Specifically, Istio's authorization policies, which are based on URI paths, could be bypassed by including a fragment in the requested path. The authorization check used the path without the fragment, while the request was routed to the backend with a normalized form of the full path including the fragment.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Authorization Bypass:**  The core vulnerability is the ability to bypass Istio's URI path-based authorization policies.
*   **Fragment Handling:** The weakness lies in the inconsistent handling of URI fragments between authorization checks and routing. The authorization check uses the path without the fragment while the request is routed with the fragment encoded in the path.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** An attacker can potentially bypass authorization policies that are meant to restrict access to certain resources based on URI paths.
*   **Security Incidents:** This bypass could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality, which could lead to a security incident.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based.
*   **HTTP Request Modification:** An attacker crafts an HTTP request containing a fragment in the URI path to bypass access control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Istio service.
*   **Understanding of Authorization Policies:**  The attacker needs to understand the authorization policies in place to be able to construct a request that exploits the bypass.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any specific privileges or authentication prior to attempting the exploit.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability affects Istio versions prior to 1.9.8, 1.10.4, and 1.11.1.
*   The fix involves normalizing the URI path by stripping the fragment before authorization checks.
*   A workaround involves using a Lua filter to normalize the path.
*   The CVE is related to a fix in Envoy (CVE-2021-32779) as Istio utilizes Envoy.
*   A mitigation is described, which involves removing the fragment part before authorization and routing
*   The severity of this vulnerability is rated as High with a CVSS score of 8.1.
