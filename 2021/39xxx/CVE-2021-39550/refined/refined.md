The provided content is related to CVE-2021-39550. It describes a heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `readFromFile` function of the `SelaFile` class, specifically at line 90 of `sela_file.cpp`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: The code reads beyond the allocated buffer in memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash: The AddressSanitizer output shows that the program aborts due to the heap-buffer-overflow.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: Although not explicitly stated, heap-buffer-overflows can often be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted input file: The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted input file with the `-d` option.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input file to the vulnerable application.
