# Anonymous user can enumerate all users through `/api/v4/users/:id`

## Background

An anonymous user can currently use the API to retrieve information about any GitLab user by either ID or username:

* Anonymous users CANNOT use the [API endpoint to list all users](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#list-users). An anonymous request returns 403 Forbidden unless there is a `username` parameter. That is deliberate. From [20f679d6](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/commit/20f679d620380b5b5e662b790c76caf256867b01 "Allow unauthenticated access to the `/api/v4/users` API."): "The issue filtering frontend code needs access to this [username] API for non-logged-in users + public projects.")
* Anonymous users CAN use the [API endpoint to get a single user by numeric ID](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#single-user). An anonymous request returns 200 OK with the user's information. This may not be deliberate.

## Problem to solve

Anonymous users can enumerate GitLab users through the [API endpoint to get a single user](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#single-user) (`/api/v4/users/:id`), because the `:id` values are numeric and sequential. It seems this shouldn't be allowed in general, and also seems different from our treatment of the [API endpoint to list all users](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#list-users) specifically.

## Proposal

Anonymous users should not be able to get user information by ID.

Note: This proposal is only feasible if there is no frontend dependency (like there is with `username` lookup).

Since same attack is applicable for `/api/v4/users/:id/followers` and `/api/v4/users/:id/following` we should require authentication for those endpoints too.

## Out of scope

The [API endpoint to "lookup users by username"](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/users.html#for-normal-users) should not be changed, because the frontend relies on this endpoint for anonymous users, and this endpoint is not as vulnerable to enumeration.
