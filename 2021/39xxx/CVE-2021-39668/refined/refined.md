Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39668:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the recreation of an intent within SystemUI.  Recreating a control's intent in SystemUI can be exploited to launch intents with SystemUI's privileges, which are greater than those of the originating application. This can be exploited to execute actions with higher privileges than intended.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Intent Re-creation:** The core weakness is the re-creation of intents within SystemUI instead of using a controlled method to add additional parameters to the application's intent.
-   **Privilege Escalation:** This re-creation allows the launch of intents with SystemUI's elevated privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute actions that normally require higher privileges than the application has. This could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive resources or the execution of privileged operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   An attacker can craft an intent that, when recreated by SystemUI, gains elevated privileges. This can be achieved through manipulating an application that triggers this intent recreation in SystemUI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to be able to craft and launch an intent that can trigger SystemUI to recreate it. The attacker likely needs to have an application with the ability to trigger this system UI functionality.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided commit message indicates that the fix involves using the `fillInIntent` parameter to supply additional parameters to the application, rather than recreating the intent.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity, likely due to the potential for privilege escalation.
