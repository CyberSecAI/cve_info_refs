{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A segmentation fault occurs within the `frame::FrameDecoder::process()` function, specifically at line 65 of `frame_decoder.cpp`. This is due to a read memory access on an invalid address (0x000000000000).",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The code attempts to dereference a pointer that is likely null or invalid, leading to a segmentation fault. This indicates a potential lack of proper input validation, boundary checks or initialization of a variable or a data structure.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Exploitation leads to a crash of the program due to a segmentation fault. This could cause denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by providing a crafted input that leads to the faulty memory access. The specific input was provided as a zip file named `SEGV-process-frame_decoder-65.zip`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to provide crafted input to the vulnerable application. The attacker does not require any special privileges and a local user can execute the vulnerable binary with the crafted input."
