Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39232:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a missing administrative check for certain SCM (Storage Container Manager) related admin commands in Apache Ozone. This means that authenticated users, not just administrators, could execute these commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the execution of SCM admin commands that are not properly protected by an admin check. This can be done by any authenticated user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Apache Ozone system. No special administrative privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- This issue is tracked as HDDS-4530.
