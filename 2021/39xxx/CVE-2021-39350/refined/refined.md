Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39350:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance**
The provided content directly mentions "CVE-2021-39350" in relation to the "FV Flowplayer Video Player" plugin, and the changeset from the trac system of WordPress clearly shows the fix for a XSS vulnerability associated with the `player_id` parameter in the `stats.php` file.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of the `player_id` GET parameter in the `stats.php` file. Specifically, the code was using `~~$_GET['player_id']~~`, which is a double bitwise NOT operator to convert the `player_id` to an integer, but is not sufficient for sanitization. It allows for user input to be directly reflected into the HTML.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This is the primary vulnerability. Unsanitized user input from the `player_id` GET parameter is being echoed back to the user in HTML context without proper escaping.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
- **Execution of Arbitrary JavaScript:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the `player_id` parameter, which will then be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they visit the vulnerable page. This can lead to:
    -  **Session Hijacking:**  Stealing cookies and session tokens to impersonate the victim.
    -  **Malware Injection:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites or tricking them to download malicious software.
    -  **Defacement:** Modifying the content of the page to display malicious or unwanted information.
    - **Information disclosure:** Accessing sensitive information.

**5. Attack vectors:**
- **GET parameter manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the vulnerable `player_id` parameter. When a user clicks on the malicious link, their browser executes the injected JavaScript. This can be done through social engineering (email, instant messaging)

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **No specific role or privilages is needed:** The attack can be carried out by an unauthenticated user.
- **Ability to craft a malicious URL:** The attacker needs to be able to create a URL containing the malicious code injected in the `player_id` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker requires a vector to get a victim to visit the malicious URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Wordfence content also confirms this vulnerability, classifying it as a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting, and identifies the vulnerable file as `~/view/stats.php`.
*  The fix included an `intval` call to properly sanitize the `player_id` GET parameter, and this also confirmed by the diff from the WordPress trac.

In summary, CVE-2021-39350 is a reflected XSS vulnerability in the FV Flowplayer Video Player WordPress plugin. It is due to the lack of proper input validation on the `player_id` parameter, which makes it possible for attackers to inject malicious scripts through crafted URLs.
