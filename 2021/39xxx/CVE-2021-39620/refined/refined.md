Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39620:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a complex implementation within the Parcel component, specifically related to the handling of unowned objects during error conditions. This leads to an issue where extra objects are released in the Parcel error path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper resource management, specifically within the Parcel component.
- Potential for memory corruption or unexpected behavior due to releasing unowned objects.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Elevation of Privilege (EoP): The vulnerability is categorized as an EoP, meaning a local attacker can exploit this to gain elevated privileges.
- The high severity rating suggests significant control over the device can be gained through exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local attack: The attacker needs to be local to the device, implying they must have some level of access already.
- Exploitation likely involves crafting a specific Parcel structure that triggers the error path, leading to the release of unowned objects.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access to the device
- Ability to send/manipulate parcel data

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability is addressed in AOSP versions 11 and 12 with the fix commit being f2e0a95700a937e421647623a60c9fc01d6e5d87.
- The fix involves adding a test case which fails on a device without the fix and passes on a device with the fix, implying a direct fix to the resource management.
- The commit message explicitly states the cause is an "extra release of unowned objects in the parcel error path"
- The vulnerability has been cherry-picked from commits 04390376b043bf6a15ff2943a9ed63d9d8173842 and 7c8497e0127dde63957ee39e90e62b119d09948d.
