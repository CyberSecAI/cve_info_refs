Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39192:

**Root Cause:**
- An error in the implementation of the limits service in Ghost versions 4.0.0 to 4.9.4.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  The vulnerability is a privilege escalation issue.
- All authenticated users, including contributors with limited privileges, can access Admin-level API keys through the integrations API endpoint.
- This should not be the case since these keys should only be available to administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows any authenticated user to obtain admin-level API keys.
- This could lead to a complete compromise of the Ghost instance, with attackers having the ability to perform any administrative action.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exposed through the network via the integrations API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the affected Ghost instance. This includes users with minimal privileges like "contributor".

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue was fixed in version 4.10.0.
- It is highly recommended to regenerate all API keys after patching.
- A workaround was to disable all non-administrator accounts.
- The CVSS score is 6.5 (Moderate) with a base metric of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
