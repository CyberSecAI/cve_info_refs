# Privilege escalation: all users can access Admin-level API keys

Moderate

[matthanley](/matthanley)
published
GHSA-j5c2-hm46-wp5c
Jul 20, 2021

## Package

npm

ghost
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=4.0.0 <4.10.0

## Patched versions

4.10.0

## Description

### Impact

An error in the implementation of the limits service in 4.0.0 allows all authenticated users (including contributors) to view admin-level API keys via the integrations API endpoint, leading to a privilege escalation vulnerability.

Ghost(Pro) has already been patched. Self-hosters are impacted if running Ghost a version between 4.0.0 and 4.9.4. Immediate action should be taken to secure your site - see patches & workarounds below.

It is highly recommended to regenerate all API keys after patching or applying the workaround below.

### Patches

Fixed in 4.10.0, all 4.x sites should upgrade as soon as possible.

### Workarounds

* Disable all non-Administrator accounts to prevent API access.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* email us at security@ghost.org

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
