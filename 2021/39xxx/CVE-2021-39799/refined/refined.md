Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39799:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a mismatch in the `Bitmap_createFromParcel` function within the Android Framework. Specifically, the function does not properly validate the process ID (PID).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Insufficient Input Validation:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper input validation of the process ID (PID) when creating a Bitmap object from a Parcel. The system assumes that the given PID is trustworthy which allows an attacker to supply a malicious one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows a local attacker to gain elevated privileges on the affected Android device without needing additional execution privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **Local Attack:** This is a local vulnerability which means an attacker needs to have a presence on the device in order to exploit the vulnerability.
* **Malicious Parcel:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted Parcel object containing a malicious process ID to the vulnerable `Bitmap_createFromParcel` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target device. This could be achieved through a malicious app installed by the user.

**Additional Details:**
* **AOSP Versions Affected:** The vulnerability is present in AOSP versions 12 and 12L.
* **Patch:** The vulnerability was fixed with a patch: `b716ef0497811c40f4908d657d3c9f99fa23595d`
* The fix introduces validation to ensure that the PID is trustworthy.
