    "root_cause": "The application does not properly validate user-supplied input when setting up status checks for merge requests, leading to an Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)",
       "Insufficient input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can obtain the names of protected branches from private projects that they do not have access to. This information disclosure can be used to further target those projects.",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the `protected_branch_ids` parameter in the API request to add a status check for a merge request, an attacker can specify arbitrary branch IDs, even those belonging to private projects. The application then returns the branch name in the response, disclosing the name of the protected branch.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be a maintainer of a project to access the 'Status Checks' feature. They must also have knowledge of how to intercept and modify API requests."
