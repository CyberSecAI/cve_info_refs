The provided content is related to CVE-2021-39138.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of session creation for anonymous users in parse-server when using the REST API. When an anonymous user is first signed up, the server incorrectly sets the `authProvider` field in the `_Session` class under `createdWith` to `password`, as if the user had signed up with a username and password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the incorrect classification of anonymous user sessions. The `createdWith` field in the session data falsely indicates that the session was created using a password, while it was created via anonymous login. This discrepancy can lead to incorrect access control decisions when developers rely directly on the `createdWith` field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability's impact is limited to developers who rely on the `createdWith` field in the `_Session` class to differentiate between password-based users and anonymous users. If a developer uses this field to implement different access control levels or logic, the server will incorrectly classify anonymous users as password users, potentially granting them unintended access or privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through the REST API endpoint used to signup anonymous users. When an anonymous user signs up via REST API, the session is created with incorrect `authProvider` information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker, in this context, would be a client or user of the parse-server application attempting to use the anonymous login feature. No special privileges or attacker positioning is needed; they just need to use the standard anonymous login flow to trigger the vulnerability.
