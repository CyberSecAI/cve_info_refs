  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Project access token names are used as the name of the underlying bot user created to facilitate the token. These bot users are publicly viewable through both the website and the API.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information disclosure due to the public visibility of bot user names which are derived from project access token names.",
      "Lack of awareness by users that the 'name of the token' will be the name of the underlying bot user."
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthenticated users can obtain information about private projects, including project IDs, member names, project names, company names, and build tools by searching for bot users. In some instances, project access tokens can be leaked.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "GraphQL API query to search for bot users based on username patterns such as `_bot`.",
         "Directly accessing user profiles on the website via `https://gitlab.com/USERNAME`"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "No authentication is required. An attacker only needs knowledge of the API endpoint or the ability to access publicly viewable user profiles."
