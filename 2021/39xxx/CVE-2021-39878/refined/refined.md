Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `external_link` helper in GitLab not validating the provided URL. Specifically, it allows `javascript:` URLs which leads to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The `/-/jira_connect/users?return_to=xxx` endpoint uses the value of `xxx` directly as a link without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XSS (Cross-Site Scripting):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By crafting a malicious URL with a `javascript:` scheme, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code that executes in the victim's browser context.
- **Lack of URL validation:** The `external_link` helper does not properly validate or sanitize the provided URL, allowing non-HTTP/HTTPS schemes.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a logged-in user's browser session. This can have severe consequences, including:
    - **Session hijacking:** Stealing the user's session cookies to impersonate them.
    - **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive user data, including personal information or project data.
    - **Malicious actions:** Performing actions on behalf of the user, such as creating, modifying or deleting resources.
    - **Redirection:** Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
- **Impact on logged-in users:** This vulnerability affects logged-in users, regardless of the project they are working on.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious URL crafting:** An attacker crafts a malicious URL with the format `https://<gitlab-instance>/-/jira_connect/users?return_to=javascript:evil_code`.
- **User interaction:** The victim must click the "Return to GitLab for Jira" button to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct and distribute a malicious link with a `javascript:` URL to a logged in victim.
- The target GitLab environment should not have a Content Security Policy (CSP) configured that would block the execution of the malicious JavaScript.
- The attack is most effective in browsers like Safari, where the `javascript:` url is directly interpreted as javascript code. Other browsers might open a new tab or block execution.

**Additional notes**
- The report indicates the vulnerability is blocked by CSP at GitLab.com, suggesting that a proper configuration of CSP can mitigate the risk.
- The vulnerability exists in GitLab version 13.11.3-ee and potentially earlier versions.
- The report includes details on how to reproduce the vulnerability.
