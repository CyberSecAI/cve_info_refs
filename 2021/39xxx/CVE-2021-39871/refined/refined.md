{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application setting to disable Bitbucket Server import source is not enforced when importing projects via the API.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The application allows project creation via API using a disabled import source. This is a bypass of the intended admin configuration.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Users can bypass the administrator's setting to disable Bitbucket Server project imports, allowing them to create projects from this source when it should be blocked.",
  "Attack vectors": "An authenticated user can make a POST request to the `/api/v4/import/bitbucket_server` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the GitLab instance, with a valid private token. They also need to know the URL of a Bitbucket Server instance and have valid credentials for it."
