Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39210:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The autologin cookie, used when a user selects the "remember me" feature, is accessible by scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Script Accessibility:** The primary vulnerability is that the autologin cookie is not marked as HttpOnly, making it accessible to client-side scripts.
*   **Cookie Theft:** A malicious script could potentially access and steal the autologin cookie.
*  **CWE-1004**:  Improper Restriction of Rendered UI Layers or Frames

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** If a malicious script successfully steals the autologin cookie, it can be used to bypass the regular login process.
*   **Account Takeover:** An attacker could gain unauthorized access to the user's account using the stolen cookie.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Plugin:** A malicious plugin installed in the GLPI system or a script injected through a different vulnerability (e.g. XSS) could be used to steal the cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Execute Malicious Scripts:** The attacker needs the ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript within the context of a logged-in user's browser session. This could be achieved through a malicious plugin or Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Target User using "Remember Me" feature:** The user must have used the "remember me" feature which creates this cookie.
*   **Knowledge of the vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerability to exploit it correctly.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" in severity.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 9.5.6 of GLPI.
*   A workaround is to avoid using the "remember me" feature.
