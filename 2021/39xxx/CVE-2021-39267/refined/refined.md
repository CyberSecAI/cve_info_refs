{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly validate the mime type of uploaded files, allowing an attacker to bypass the 'text/html' filter by using alternative content types such as 'text/xml', 'application/xhtml+xml', 'application/xml', 'image/svg+xml', 'application/hta' which can execute JavaScript code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Improper file type validation",
    "Stored XSS"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can perform a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack. When a user views the malicious file, the injected JavaScript code will execute, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, redirect the user to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions within the application's context.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves uploading a malicious file with a manipulated 'Content-Type' header, bypassing the application's mime type filter. The file can then be executed via the 'download.php' endpoint with the `preview=true` parameter or by clicking the view file icon on the UI.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files to the SuiteCRM application. This typically requires an authenticated user account with file upload permissions. The attacker needs to manipulate the content-type header of the uploaded file."
