{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `wasmtime` crate's `Linker::func_*` APIs were not sound when different `Engine` instances were used to create the `Linker` and the `Store`. This led to type confusion of function pointers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Type confusion of function pointers",
       "Incorrect use of multiple Engine instances with a Linker"
    ],
    "impact": "A type confusion vulnerability that allows calling a function with the wrong type. This could potentially lead to memory unsafety issues.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by using at least two different `Engine` values in an embedding, and then using a `Linker` with two different `Engine` values (one at creation time, one at instantiation time).",
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to use multiple `Engine` instances within a `wasmtime` embedding and to control the `Engine` used at `Linker` creation and module instantiation"
  },
  "affected_packages": [
    {
      "name": "rust-wasmtime-fiber",
      "version": "0.30.0-1.fc34"

      "name": "rust-cranelift-frontend",
      "version": "0.77.0-1.fc35"
    }
  ],
    "patch_details": {
    "fixes": "The vulnerability is addressed by changing the behavior to `panic!()` in Rust when different `Engine` instances are used with a `Linker`. This prevents the silent type confusion and crashes the program instead.",
    "workarounds": "Using only one `Engine` for the entire program or ensuring the `Linker` is used with only one `Engine` if multiple are required."
