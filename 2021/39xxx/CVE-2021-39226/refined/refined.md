Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39226:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**
   - The provided documents, particularly the NetApp advisory and the GitHub advisory, clearly identify CVE-2021-39226 as the vulnerability being addressed. The description and impact align across these sources.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability**
   - The root cause lies in how Grafana handles snapshot access and deletion via specific API endpoints. The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper authentication/authorization checks when accessing or deleting snapshots via direct paths, particularly for the snapshot with the lowest database key.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**
   -  **Authentication Bypass:** Unauthenticated users could view snapshots and delete them under certain conditions.
   - **Missing Authorization Checks:** Direct paths like `/dashboard/snapshot/:key`, `/api/snapshots/:key`, and `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey` were not properly restricted.
   - **Data Exposure:** Users could access sensitive snapshot data without authorization.
   - **Data Modification:** Users, both authenticated and unauthenticated (under specific conditions), could delete snapshot data.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** By combining the deletion and viewing capabilities, an attacker could enumerate and delete all snapshot data, leading to a permanent DoS.

**4. Impact of Exploitation**
   - **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** Unauthorized access to snapshot data.
   - **Addition or Modification of Data:** Deletion of snapshots, resulting in data loss.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Complete snapshot data loss due to enumeration and deletion.

**5. Attack Vectors**
   - **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through HTTP requests.
   - **Direct Path Access:** Attackers can directly access the vulnerable paths:
      - `/dashboard/snapshot/:key`
      - `/api/snapshots/:key`
      - `/api/snapshots-delete/:deleteKey`

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Grafana instance.
   - **No Authentication Required for Viewing:** Initially, no authentication is needed to view snapshot data if the lowest database key is known.
   - **No Authentication or Valid User Account required for Deletion:** With public mode enabled, no authentication is needed to delete the lowest database key snapshot. If public mode is not enabled, valid authentication is needed.
   - **Understanding the Lowest Key:** The attacker needs to be able to identify or enumerate the lowest database key.

**Additional Technical Details:**

   - The vulnerability exists in Grafana versions from 2.0.1 to 8.1.6.
   - Patched versions are 7.5.11 and 8.1.6.
   - A workaround using a reverse proxy to block access to the literal paths is mentioned
   - The NetApp advisory specifies that "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Grafana". However, it indicates that no NetApp products are affected. This likely means that while NetApp products may include Grafana, it is not exposed or configured in a way that makes them vulnerable to this CVE.
    - The GitHub advisory provides details on how to audit potential attacks by searching reverse proxy/load balancer logs, or through the Grafana Enterprise audit feature, indicating that the issue may be externally visible.

In summary, CVE-2021-39226 is a critical vulnerability in Grafana that enables unauthorized viewing and deletion of snapshot data due to a lack of proper authorization checks. The vulnerability is network-accessible and has severe implications for data confidentiality and availability. Although NetApp products incorporate Grafana, they are not listed as affected.
