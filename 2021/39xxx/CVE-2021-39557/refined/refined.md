The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in `swftools`, specifically within the `xpdf/gmem.cc:101` file.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a stack overflow within the `gmalloc` function in `xpdf/gmem.cc:101`, which is triggered when processing a crafted PDF file. This function is called recursively, leading to excessive memory allocation on the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow vulnerability in `gmalloc` function.
- Recursive calls to `gmalloc` without proper checks lead to stack exhaustion.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Segmentation fault and program termination.
- Potential for denial-of-service (DoS) due to the crash.
- The ASAN output shows a stack overflow, which implies that an attacker could potentially control the execution of the program, possibly leading to more severe consequences.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted PDF file provided as input to `pdf2swf`.
- The vulnerable code is triggered during PDF parsing when `pdf2swf` processes the crafted PDF file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to provide a crafted PDF file to the `pdf2swf` tool.
- No special privileges are required.
