- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of privilege restrictions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Privilege escalation. An authenticated local attacker can perform specific operations due to insufficient privilege restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain higher privileges on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access, requiring the attacker to have an existing account with common privileges on the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to log in to the system with a common user account and be able to perform specific operations to exploit the vulnerability.
