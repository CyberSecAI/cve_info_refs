- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A double-free vulnerability exists in the `dwg_free_MATERIAL_private` function within `dwg.spec`. This is due to an incorrect handling of the transmatrix when map.source == 2, causing the same memory to be freed twice.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double-free vulnerability, use-after-free
- **Impact of exploitation:** Program crash due to double free.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a specially crafted DWG file where `map.source == 2`. The program attempts to free the same memory location twice.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted DWG file that triggers the double-free condition.
