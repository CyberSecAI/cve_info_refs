Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39391:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of the request path when navigating to a page. Specifically, the "Request statistics" section in the admin panel does not properly sanitize the path, allowing for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability. The application fails to sanitize user-controlled input (specifically, the URL path), which allows an attacker to inject and execute malicious JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the admin panel, potentially leading to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing session cookies
    - Performing actions on behalf of the admin user
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Defacing the admin panel
    - Gaining unauthorized access to sensitive information
    - Other malicious actions that an attacker can perform in the user's browser context

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker injects the malicious code into the URL path of the web application.
- When an administrator navigates to the crafted URL, the injected script is executed in the admin panel, specifically within the "Request statistics" section.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious JavaScript code.
- The attacker needs to entice an administrator of the Beego application to visit this crafted URL, either directly or indirectly.
- The attacker does not require any special privileges or access, they only need to exploit the lack of sanitization of URL paths in the admin panel.
