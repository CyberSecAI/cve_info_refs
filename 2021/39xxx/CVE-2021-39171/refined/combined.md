# Unlimited transforms allowed for signed nodes

Moderate

[cjbarth](/cjbarth)
published
GHSA-5379-r78w-42h2
Aug 27, 2021

## Package

npm

passport-saml
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 3.1.0

## Patched versions

3.1.0

## Description

### Impact

A malicious SAML payload can require transforms that consume significant system resources to process, thereby resulting in reduced or denied service. This would be an effective way to perform a denial-of-service attack.

### Patches

This has been resolved in version 3.1.0. The resolution is to limit the number of allowable transforms to 2.

### References

[#595](https://github.com/node-saml/passport-saml/pull/595)

### Severity

Moderate

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

As far as I know a WebSSO profile shouldn't have more than 2 Transform, at most an "enveloped-signature" and an exclusive canonicalization transform. A SAMLResponse can force xml-crypto to needlessly spend time, bound only by POST size constraints.

All tests pass.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| I think this one might be good: <https://www.w3.org/TR/xmldsig-bestpractices/Overview_diff.html#too-many-tranforms>  I have not looked much at how other implementations have dealt with this specific concern, but I've found that Spring Security SAML is using OpenSAML, which in turn is putting a limit of two: <https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-security-saml/blob/08a236e1c65c4fb559282a7f16115e6f122d77b0/core/src/main/java/org/springframework/security/saml/websso/AbstractProfileBase.java#L263> <https://git.shibboleth.net/view/?p=java-opensaml.git;a=blob;f=opensaml-saml-impl/src/main/java/org/opensaml/saml/security/impl/SAMLSignatureProfileValidator.java;h=d38caf044cfa8fc4bb98e79e45088424b64eee80;hb=HEAD#l218> |

| [@markstos](https://github.com/markstos) I'm not knowledgeable enough on query optimization, but I feel it kinda works for my local test cases. Test time grows slowly with the SAMLResponse size, but without the fix the same payload triggers a timeout. |

| [@cjbarth](https://github.com/cjbarth) Look at section "2.1.7 Example: Denial of service caused by too many transforms" (but skip the XPath part). The fragment on your link is pointing me to "2.1.1 Example: XSLT transform that causes denial of service", which I feel is more a xml-crypto concern (it would need first to support the <http://www.w3.org/TR/1999/REC-xslt-19991116> Transform algorithm to be potentially vulnerable).  I'm a bit shy about pushing a test as a PoC but I've been successful in triggering timeouts (> 2000ms in tests) with a specific Transform repeated hundreds of times. We can move to email for that though. |

| [@pp-ps](https://github.com/pp-ps) I see you reverted the changes on your branch. Have you found something out about them that causes you to change your mind? |

| [@markstos](https://github.com/markstos) that's doable, I'm OOO but when back I'll push a faster test (3/5 transforms) to this PR branch. I created the test on the "timeout" branch with thousands of Transforms to show the potential for DOS abuse (CPU is busy doing pointless work). [@cjbarth](https://github.com/cjbarth) I think there is a misunderstanding, I reverted my commit only on the "timeout" branch to show passport-saml default behavior with a lot of Transforms, namely a timeout of over 2000ms. |

| [@markstos](https://github.com/markstos) [@cjbarth](https://github.com/cjbarth) I've just pushed a quick test. If you have checked the behavior on the timeout branch and agree that this can be abused by unauthenticated requests (limited by POST size only), I would suggest a minor release now that all the details are public. |

| There is one little spelling change, otherwise, I think this might be something to land and then to release. We will also need this duplicated against [node-saml](https://github.com/node-saml/node-saml) so they don't get out-of-sync during the transition. |
