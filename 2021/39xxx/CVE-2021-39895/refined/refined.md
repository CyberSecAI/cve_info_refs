Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39895:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the fact that pipeline schedules in GitLab projects are automatically set to "active" after the project is imported. This behavior allows an attacker to include a malicious pipeline schedule in a project they create and then have it automatically activate and run on a victim's group after the victim imports the attacker's project.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Automatic Activation of Pipeline Schedules:** The key weakness is that imported pipeline schedules are not deactivated by default and become active immediately upon import.
- **Lack of Sanitization/Validation:** The project import process does not check or sanitize the pipeline schedules.
- **Uncontrolled Execution:**  The imported pipeline runs on behalf of the group owner or maintainer who imported the project.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can steal CI/CD variables, including sensitive information like personal access tokens, passwords, and other secrets, through the malicious pipeline execution.
- **Lateral Movement:** Stolen personal access tokens can be used to access other projects of the maintainer/owner.
- **Privilege Escalation:** The imported project's pipeline runs with the privileges of the user who imported the project, potentially leading to unintended access or actions within the group.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Project Import:** The primary attack vector involves creating a malicious project with a crafted pipeline schedule and convincing a group maintainer/owner to import it into their group.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs a user with sufficient privileges (maintainer or owner of the group) to import the malicious project.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **GitLab Account:** The attacker needs a GitLab account to create and export the malicious project.
- **Knowledge of GitLab CI/CD:** The attacker needs to know how to set up a scheduled pipeline to send a request to an attacker-controlled server.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a user with sufficient privileges to import their project.
