    "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts, which can lead to a variety of malicious actions, like stealing cookies or credentials, defacing the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when a user visits a specially crafted URL that contains the malicious payload in the request path.",

  "affected_component": {
    "name": "Easy Social Icons",
    "version": "< 3.0.9"
    },
 "cve_id": "CVE-2021-39322",
 "extra_details": "The vulnerability is triggered due to the plugin echoing out the raw value of `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` in its main file, without sanitization, which can be exploited on certain web server configurations like Apache with mod_php. This aligns with the official CVE description which mentions the vulnerability is due to improper escaping of the  `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` input. Wordfence also confirms that the issue is reflected XSS based on a URL with an injected script and it states that this affects the 'main file' of the plugin, matching the wpvulndb description of where the vulnerability is."
