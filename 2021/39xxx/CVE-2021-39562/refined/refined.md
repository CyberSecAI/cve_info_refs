The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in `swftools` which is related to CVE-2021-39562 according to the description provided in the CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is caused by uncontrolled recursion within the `FileStream::makeSubStream` function (xpdf/Stream.cc:598) when processing a specially crafted PDF file.

**Vulnerability:**
- **Stack Overflow:** The recursive calls to `FileStream::makeSubStream`, which is triggered during object fetching, leads to a stack overflow. This occurs when the `XRef::fetch`, `Object::dictLookup`, `Parser::makeStream`, and `Parser::getObj` functions call each other recursively in a loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The stack overflow leads to a segmentation fault, causing the program (`pdf2swf`) to crash.

**Attack Vector:**
- **Malicious PDF File:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious PDF file which, when processed by the vulnerable `pdf2swf` tool, triggers the recursive calls causing the stack overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a malicious PDF file to the vulnerable `pdf2swf` tool.
- No special privileges are required on the target system.
- The attacker does not need to be on the same network or have any special access to the victim's system beyond the ability to provide the crafted PDF to the program.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided AddressSanitizer output clearly shows the recursive call chain leading to the stack overflow.
- A proof-of-concept (POC) file (`stack-overflow-Stream-598.zip`) is provided, demonstrating the vulnerability and enabling testing.
- The issue was originally reported as a stack overflow, which is later clarified as a segmentation fault due to the stack overflow.
