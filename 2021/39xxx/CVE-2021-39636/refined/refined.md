  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "Several netfilter matches and targets put kernel pointers into info objects but do not set usersize in descriptors. This results in kernel pointer leaks if a match/target is set and read back to userspace.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Kernel pointers leaked to userspace",
       "Missing usersize definition for certain netfilter matches and targets"
    ],
    "impact": "Kernel pointer leaks can be used to bypass KASLR and facilitate further exploitation",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "A user-space application can read back kernel data via netfilter objects that contain kernel pointers due to missing usersize fields in the descriptors."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to set and read back netfilter matches or targets with kernel pointer information."
