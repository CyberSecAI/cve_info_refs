Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39164:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper authorization checks when accessing room membership data via the `/members` endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:**  Unauthorized users were able to retrieve the member list of a private room if they knew the room's ID and the room's history visibility was set to `shared`.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allowed exposure of room members' display names.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Enumeration of Room Members:** An attacker could list the members of a private room, including their display names, without being authorized.
- **Privacy Breach:** The exposure of room membership and display names compromises the privacy of users within the affected private rooms.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct API Request:** Attackers could make direct requests to the `/members` endpoint with an `at` query parameter if the history visibility was set to `shared`
    -  `/_matrix/client/r0/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter
    -  `/_matrix/client/unstable/rooms/{room_id}/members` with `at` query parameter

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Knowledge of Room ID:** The attacker needs to know the Room ID of the private room.
- **Shared History Visibility:** The target room's history visibility must be set to `shared`.
- **Same Homeserver:** The attacker must have an account on the same homeserver as a user who is a member of the target room.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in Synapse version 1.41.1 and 1.42.0rc1.
- The advisory also suggests workarounds for administrators using a reverse proxy, but notes that these workarounds may result in an unacceptable loss of functionality.
- The vulnerability was reported by 0xkasper.
