  "CVE-2021-39800": {
    "Root cause": "The `pass_to_user()` function could call `kref_put()` on an ION handle before it is finalized.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free vulnerability"
    ],
    "Impact": "A client could potentially free an ION handle while it is still being used, potentially leading to a use-after-free condition.",
    "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered through the `pass_to_user()` function which interacts with ION handles.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to have the ability to trigger the `pass_to_user()` function and manipulate the ION handle lifecycle."
