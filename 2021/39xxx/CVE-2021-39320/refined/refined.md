RELATED: CVE-2021-39320
   
**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin echoes the value of the `$GLOBALS['PHP_SELF']` variable without proper sanitization, which on some server configurations, can be exploited to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious Javascript code that will execute within an administrator's browser session by tricking them into clicking a specially crafted link. This could lead to actions such as creating a new administrative user, installing backdoors, and ultimately, site takeover.

**Attack vectors:** A crafted URL is used to execute Javascript when loaded by a victim user, which can be an administrator user with access to the vulnerable plugin's settings page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to craft a specific URL and trick an administrator user into visiting it.
