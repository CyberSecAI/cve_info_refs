- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper security permission configuration on ACPU (Application Coprocessor Unit).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incorrectly configured security permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a compromise of service confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not explicitly described, but it involves exploiting the improper permission settings on the ACPU.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Specific attacker capabilities/position are not detailed beyond the need to exploit the described vulnerability in the ACPU.
