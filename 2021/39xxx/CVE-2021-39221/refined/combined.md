# XSS in Contacts

Low

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-j6cx-mxqf-f9vc
Oct 25, 2021

## Package

Contacts
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 4.0.3

## Patched versions

4.0.3

## Description

### Impact

The Nextcloud Contacts application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. For exploitation, a user would need to right-click on a malicious file and open the file in a new tab.

Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Contacts application is upgraded to 4.0.3.

### Workarounds

Use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy. You can find a list of supported browsers on [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/contentsecuritypolicy). A notable exemption is Internet Explorer which does not support CSP properly.

### References

### Severity

Low

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-39221

### Weaknesses

[CWE-434](/advisories?query=cwe%3A434)

Better safe than sorry. And if they don't pass then we just display no photo. Good enough :)
