Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Nextcloud Contacts application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided data, specifically within SVG files used for contact avatars.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored XSS:** The application did not properly sanitize SVG files, allowing malicious JavaScript code embedded within these files to be stored.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The application failed to sanitize the SVG file content before rendering it.
- **Lack of CSP Enforcement on Older Browsers:** While modern browsers with Content Security Policy (CSP) support mitigated the impact, older browsers (such as Internet Explorer), which do not properly support CSP, were vulnerable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into an SVG file.
- When a user would right-click on the malicious file and open the file in a new tab (or, possibly, if the image was rendered), the injected JavaScript would execute in the context of the user's session, potentially allowing the attacker to:
  - Steal session cookies.
  - Perform actions on behalf of the user.
  - Redirect the user to a malicious website.
  - Other malicious actions allowed by a compromised user session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** An attacker would need to upload a specially crafted malicious SVG file as a contact avatar.
- **User Interaction:** The user would need to right-click on the malicious file and open it in a new tab for the XSS to trigger.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of Nextcloud.
- The attacker needs the ability to upload files as contact avatars.
- The attacker needs to trick the victim to open the malicious file in a new tab (or, possibly, render it if displayed).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity because of the requirement to open a malicious file in a new tab and the mitigation provided by CSP on modern browsers.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.0.3 of the Nextcloud Contacts application with sanitization of SVG files before they are rendered.
- The associated pull request (#2407) on the `nextcloud/contacts` Github repository was created to implement the fix, which involved running SVG files through a sanitization process.
