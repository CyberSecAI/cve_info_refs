Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper caller checks within the `com.android.credentials.RESET` functionality. Specifically, any application could call the `RESET` function to reset device credentials. The fix adds checks to ensure that only the Settings app (and the Car Settings app) can initiate a credential reset via `com.android.credentials.RESET`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Inadequate Access Control:** The core weakness is insufficient access control on the `com.android.credentials.RESET` intent, allowing unauthorized apps to trigger a reset of device credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** By exploiting this vulnerability, a malicious application could reset device credentials, which would disrupt normal device operation and potentially allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access or control.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Application:** A malicious app installed on the device could send the `com.android.credentials.RESET` intent, triggering the credential reset.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device to exploit this vulnerability.
- **No special privileges needed:** The attacker does not need root or elevated permissions to trigger the intent.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix involves adding caller checks in the `com.android.credentials.RESET` functionality.
- The `com.android.credentials.INSTALL` functionality should remain callable by the `CertInstaller` app, and that function was not changed as part of the fix.
- Manual testing steps are provided in the commit message to verify the fix.
