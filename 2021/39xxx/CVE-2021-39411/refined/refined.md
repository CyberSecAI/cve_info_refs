- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input in multiple HTTP parameters, allowing injection of malicious scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present in the following files and parameters:
    - `hospital/hms/doctor/search.php`, parameter: `searchdata`
    - `hospital/hms/admin/patient-search.php`, parameter: `searchdata`
    - `hospital/hms/admin/betweendates-detailsreports.php`, parameter: `fromdate`
    - `hospital/hms/admin/betweendates-detailsreports.php`, parameter: `todate`
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser session. This could lead to a variety of malicious actions, including but not limited to session hijacking, defacement of the website, or redirecting users to malicious sites, stealing sensitive information, etc.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests that include malicious JavaScript code in the vulnerable parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable application and have a user access the malicious content. No special privileges are mentioned, suggesting that the attacker can be anyone with network access to the application.
