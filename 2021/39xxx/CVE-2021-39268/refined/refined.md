  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient filtering of SVG files uploaded to SuiteCRM. The `clean_file_output` function only prevents redirects to other domains, but does not prevent client-side attacks.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Lack of proper sanitization of SVG files",
        "Inadequate filtering of client-side attacks",
		"Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (that allows svg execution)"
      ],
      "impact": "A malicious user can upload a specially crafted SVG file containing JavaScript code. When another user previews this file, the JavaScript code will execute in their browser, potentially leading to a stored XSS attack.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Uploading a malicious SVG file via the file upload feature.",
        "Viewing the malicious SVG via the download preview functionality."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to upload files within SuiteCRM. This typically requires a valid user account with the necessary permissions to upload files. An attacker would then need to craft a malicious SVG file with embedded JavaScript.",
