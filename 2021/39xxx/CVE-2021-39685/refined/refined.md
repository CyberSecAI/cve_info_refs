  "CVE-2021-39685": {
    "Description": "The provided text describes a fix for a vulnerability in the Linux kernel's USB gadget driver. Some USB hosts can request buffers larger than the endpoint 0 buffer. For OUT requests, the endpoint would stall. For IN requests, the request size would be trimmed. However, in some cases, the bRequestType field's endpoint direction was not being correctly checked, allowing for incorrect buffer handling.",
    "Root cause": "Incorrect check of the bRequestType field in the USB gadget driver when handling endpoint 0 requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of USB requests leading to potential out-of-bounds access or denial of service."
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious USB host could cause the USB gadget to malfunction by requesting too-large buffers, or potentially lead to memory corruption due to incorrect buffer handling.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious USB host connected to an Android device via USB.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to control or be a malicious USB host connected to an Android device via USB."
