Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-39197:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `better_errors` gem, prior to version 2.8.0, lacked CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection for its internal requests.
*   It did not enforce the correct `Content-Type` header for these requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF Vulnerability:** The absence of CSRF protection allowed attackers to make unauthorized requests to the `better_errors` interface from a different origin.
*   **Missing `Content-Type` Enforcement:** The lack of proper `Content-Type` header enforcement enabled cross-origin "simple requests" without the usual CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) restrictions, amplifying the CSRF vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to execute arbitrary actions on a developer's machine through the `better_errors` interface. This could involve:
    *   Evaluating arbitrary code.
    *   Accessing sensitive data present in the application's context during development.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Origin Attack:** An attacker can craft a malicious web page or use other means to trigger requests to the vulnerable `better_errors` application running on a developer's machine.
*   **"Simple Requests":** Due to the lack of `Content-Type` enforcement, the attack can be performed via a simple request, bypassing CORS protections.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to induce the developer to visit a malicious web page or other means to trigger the malicious request.
*   The developer's machine needs to be running an application using a vulnerable version of the `better_errors` gem.
*  The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the vulnerable machine.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability primarily affects development environments as `better_errors` is intended to be used only in the `development` bundle group.
*   The fix involves adding CSRF token protection and enforcing the correct `Content-Type` header.
*   The provided content references a blog post by Chris Moberly that showcases an example attack combining this vulnerability with a webpack-dev-server vulnerability.
