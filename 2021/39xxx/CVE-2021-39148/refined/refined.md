Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security vulnerabilities related to XStream:

**CVE-2021-39148**
*   **Root Cause:** The XStream library, during unmarshalling, uses type information embedded in the input stream to recreate objects. This allows an attacker to manipulate the input and inject malicious objects, leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unsafe deserialization. Lack of proper input validation and sanitization, specifically regarding type information within serialized streams.
*  **Impact:** A remote attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by manipulating the processed input stream.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the input stream (e.g., XML or JSON) provided to the XStream library during the unmarshalling process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to control the input data stream that will be processed by XStream.

**CVE-2021-39151**
*   **Root Cause:** Similar to CVE-2021-39148, the vulnerability stems from XStream's deserialization process, allowing for the injection of malicious objects with type information present in the input stream.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unsafe deserialization, lack of input validation and sanitization, specifically regarding type information within serialized streams.
*  **Impact:** A remote attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by manipulating the processed input stream.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the input stream (e.g., XML or JSON) provided to the XStream library during the unmarshalling process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to control the input data stream that will be processed by XStream.

**CVE-2021-39146**
*   **Root Cause:** Similar to CVE-2021-39148 and CVE-2021-39151, the vulnerability results from insecure deserialization due to manipulated type information within the input stream.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unsafe deserialization, lack of input validation and sanitization.
*  **Impact:** A remote attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by manipulating the processed input stream.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the input stream (e.g., XML or JSON) provided to the XStream library during the unmarshalling process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to control the input data stream that will be processed by XStream.

**CVE-2021-39145**
*  **Root Cause:** Similar to other CVEs, the vulnerability is caused by XStream's insecure deserialization using type information from the input stream to instantiate objects.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unsafe deserialization, lack of input validation.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by manipulating the processed input stream.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the input stream (e.g., XML or JSON) provided to the XStream library during the unmarshalling process.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to control the input data stream that will be processed by XStream.

**CVE-2021-39150**
*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability occurs when XStream deserializes objects, allowing an attacker to manipulate the input stream and inject objects that cause server-side forgery requests.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unsafe deserialization; Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can trigger a server-side request forgery attack by manipulating the processed input stream to access data from an arbitrary URL.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the input stream (e.g., XML or JSON) provided to the XStream library during the unmarshalling process, including URLs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to control the input data stream processed by XStream, including URLs.

**CVE-2021-39147**
*   **Root Cause:** XStream insecurely deserializes objects by using type information in the input stream, allowing injection of objects leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Weaknesses:** Unsafe deserialization, lack of input validation.
*   **Impact:** A remote attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by manipulating the processed input stream.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the input stream (e.g., XML or JSON) provided to the XStream library during the unmarshalling process.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Ability to control the input data stream processed by XStream.

**General Characteristics of the Vulnerabilities**
*   **Affected Versions:** All XStream versions up to and including 1.4.17 (out-of-the-box setup). Users using the security framework with a whitelist of allowed types are not affected.
*   **Common Weakness:** All these CVEs share the same core weakness: insecure deserialization of untrusted data, specifically the ability to inject type information into the input stream to create malicious objects.
*   **Mitigation:** XStream versions 1.4.18 and later use a whitelist by default, which significantly reduces the attack surface. Users are advised to implement a whitelist of allowed types in their XStream configuration.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerabilities are not specific to XML. The attack can be performed in any supported data format (e.g., JSON).
*   The provided examples in the documentation are only to illustrate the vulnerability and how an attack payload could look like.

**Workarounds**
*   The primary workaround is to use XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types.
*   The provided data also suggests that users should upgrade to XStream 1.4.18 or later as it moves from the dangerous blacklist approach to a safer whitelist.

**In summary:** The core issue across all these CVEs is the ability for attackers to inject malicious type information into the data stream, allowing the deserialization process in XStream to instantiate arbitrary classes and execute arbitrary code or perform other malicious operations, like SSRF. The solution is to use a whitelist.
