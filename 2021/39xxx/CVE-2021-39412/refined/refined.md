- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application fails to sanitize user-supplied input used in multiple files and parameters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Multiple cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vectors involve injecting malicious scripts through the vulnerable parameters via HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request containing malicious JavaScript to the vulnerable application.
