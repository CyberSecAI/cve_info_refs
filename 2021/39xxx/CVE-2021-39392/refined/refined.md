{
  "cve": "CVE-2021-39392",
  "description": "The management tool in MyLittleBackup up to and including 1.7 allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code because machineKey is hardcoded (the same for all customers' installations) in web.config, and can be used to send serialized ASP code.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the use of a hardcoded machineKey in the `web.config` file across all customer installations. This key is intended for encryption and decryption purposes but, due to the lack of unique keys, the same key is used across all deployments.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-502 Deserialization of Untrusted Data",
      "Hardcoded cryptographic key"
    ],
    "impact": "A remote attacker can exploit this to execute arbitrary code on the server by sending specially crafted, serialized ASP code that utilizes the known `machineKey`.",
    "attack_vectors": "Remote attackers can send malicious, serialized ASP code to the vulnerable application. The application uses the hardcoded machineKey to decrypt the data, and because the attacker knows this key, it can craft malicious payloads.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to know the hardcoded `machineKey` used by all installations of the software in order to generate the malicious payload.",
	"affected_versions": "All versions up to and including 1.7"
  }
