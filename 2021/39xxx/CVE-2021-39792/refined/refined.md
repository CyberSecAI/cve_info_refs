Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-39792:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from an issue related to the formatting of function names and their offsets when dumping memory areas during debugging on ARM64 Android systems. Specifically, when inspecting running memory, functions are typically represented by their names followed by an offset. The commit message indicates a "Match upstream formatting when dumping memory areas".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure (ID):** The vulnerability is classified as an "ID" (Information Disclosure) type. This means the flaw could lead to exposing sensitive information, which in this case is related to how memory is formatted during debug dumps and would be available to local users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Moderate Severity:** The vulnerability has a moderate severity rating.
- The primary impact is the potential disclosure of information regarding function names and their memory offsets during debugging. This information could be valuable for an attacker in understanding the system's memory layout or possibly for identifying other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Access:** The vulnerability would require local access to the system, as it pertains to memory dumps used in debugging.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker would need to have the ability to trigger memory dumps and analyze the output or, have access to debugging tools on the target Android device.
