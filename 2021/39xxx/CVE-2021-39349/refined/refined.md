    "cveId": "CVE-2021-39349",
    "description": "The Author Bio Box WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input validation and sanitization via several parameters found in the ~/includes/admin/class-author-bio-box-admin.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 3.3.1. This affects multi-site installations where `unfiltered_html` is disabled for administrators, and sites where `unfiltered_html` is disabled."

    {
      "source": "github.com_c99affe1_20250115_080644.html",

            "rootCause": "The plugin's code changes involved switching the input type from 'text' to 'number' for the 'Gravatar size' and 'Border size' settings, and sanitizing the output using `sanitize_hex_color` function for color related settings. Additionally, it was using `sanitize_text_field` for other settings input which it should be using the corresponding sanitization function based on input type.",
          "weaknesses":[
             "The plugin previously used `sanitize_text_field` for all input, and did not use specific sanitization functions.",
