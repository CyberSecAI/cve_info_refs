  "CVE-2021-39945": {
    "description": "In Gitlab when a user is demoted to Guest role, the Guest user will not be able to view and edit the Merge requests in a project even if the merge request is created by him. But the Guest user can use the Approvals API to approve/unapprove the merge request even after the User is demoted to Guest. This API also leaks the Merge request details which the guest user is not supposed to view.",
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly restrict API access to merge requests after a user's role is demoted to Guest.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Authorization bypass",
       "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "Demoted users can approve merge requests they created and view confidential data of those requests, leading to sensitive information disclosure to unauthorized users.",
     "attack_vector": "The attack vector is through the Approvals API endpoints using a personal access token of the demoted user.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to have had maintainer privileges at some point, created a merge request, and then been demoted to a Guest role. They also need to create a personal access token with the available scopes selected."
