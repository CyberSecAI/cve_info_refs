{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the handling of blocked channel groups. Although `setBlocked` is a hidden API and shouldn't be directly called by applications, the system doesn't properly handle the data if an app manages to call it.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper data handling of blocked channel groups when apps call a hidden API."
    ],
    "impact": "Local escalation of privilege, potentially allowing an application to perform actions it normally shouldn't be able to.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An application can potentially call the hidden API `setBlocked` to create blocked channel groups."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to execute code as an application on the device, with the ability to call hidden APIs."
  }
