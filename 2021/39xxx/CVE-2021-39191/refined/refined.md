Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39191:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of the `target_link_uri` parameter in the 3rd-party initiated SSO functionality of `mod_auth_openidc`. This allows an attacker to inject a malicious URL into this parameter, leading to an open redirect.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Open Redirect:** The primary vulnerability is an open redirect, where a crafted URL in the `target_link_uri` parameter can redirect users to an arbitrary, potentially malicious site.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The module fails to properly validate and sanitize the `target_link_uri` parameter, allowing attacker-controlled URLs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing Attacks:** Attackers can use the open redirect to lure users to phishing sites, potentially stealing their credentials or other sensitive information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Redirecting to untrusted sites can lead to the disclosure of user-specific data present in the request or the referer header.
*   **Compromised Trust:** By redirecting users to malicious sites, the integrity and trust of the service utilizing `mod_auth_openidc` can be severely damaged.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack is performed via a specially crafted URL supplied in the `target_link_uri` parameter. This parameter is used during 3rd-party initiated SSO requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the `target_link_uri` parameter of the request that initiates the SSO process.
*   No special privileges or user interaction is required by the attacker except for the victim clicking on a crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is fixed by applying the `OIDCRedirectURLsAllowed` setting to the `target_link_uri` parameter, which restricts the allowed redirect URLs using regular expressions.
*   The fix is included in `mod_auth_openidc` version 2.4.9.4 and later.
*   The vulnerability is identified by CWE-601 (URL Redirection to Untrusted Site).
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 4.7, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N.
