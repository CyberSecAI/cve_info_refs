Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39203:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the block editor of WordPress 5.8 beta. It allows authenticated users, who should not have permission to view private post types/data, to bypass these restrictions. The specific mechanism is not detailed, but it's related to how the block editor handles permissions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Broken Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is a failure to enforce proper access controls within the block editor.
- **Data Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could access private post type data.
- **Privilege Escalation (Implied):** By accessing data they shouldn't, users could perform actions they are normally restricted from, effectively escalating privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Confidentiality breach:** Unauthorized users could view private content intended for specific roles.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** Accessing normally restricted data could be a stepping stone for other attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is likely through the web interface, where authenticated users interact with the WordPress block editor.
- **Prerequisites:** An attacker needs a valid WordPress user account.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- An attacker must be an authenticated user on the affected WordPress system.
- An attacker must be using the block editor.
- The attacker should not have permission to view the private data in question.

**Additional Notes:**

- The issue was present in the beta version of WordPress 5.8 and is fixed in the final 5.8 release.
