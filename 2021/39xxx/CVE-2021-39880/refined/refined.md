{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `ApolloUploadServer` middleware, used for handling GraphQL file uploads, allows a user to specify an arbitrary index within an array in the `operations` variable. When processing a request, if a large index is provided, the application attempts to populate the array with null values up to the specified index. This results in the generation of a large response containing error messages for each null index.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled resource consumption due to the ability to specify a large array index which leads to a large response being generated.",
      "The application does not properly validate the provided index in the map variable.",
      "The application returns the same error message for all indices that are null which can lead to the response becoming very large."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service due to the server attempting to generate a very large response, consuming significant server resources like CPU and memory.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "network_attack_vector": "An attacker sends a crafted multipart/form-data POST request to the `/api/graphql` endpoint. This request abuses the `ApolloUploadServer` middleware's file upload mechanism.",
      "specific_attack_details": "The attacker sets a large index value in the `map` variable of the multipart request. This forces the server to generate an extensive error message response. This is achieved by manipulating the `variables.files` array index through the map parameter in the graphql request"
    },
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests, including multipart/form-data requests, to the GitLab server. This can be achieved with access to the GraphQL endpoint.",
     "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was found using the Design Management functionality which uses the ApolloUploadServer middleware to upload images via graphql. The vulnerability allows to cause a DOS on the server as it needs to generate large error messages which consumes server resources"
