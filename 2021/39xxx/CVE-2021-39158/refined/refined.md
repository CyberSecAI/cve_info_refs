- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `gfortran` package, which was a dependency of NVCaffe, did not exist on pypi.org. This allowed a malicious actor to create a similarly named package on pypi.org, potentially leading users to install a malicious package when installing NVCaffe's dependencies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Dependency confusion, specifically the use of a nonexistent package name in the dependency list.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could have potentially published a malicious package to pypi.org under the `gfortran` name. Users attempting to install NVCaffe with vulnerable dependency list would instead install the malicious package, potentially executing arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the dependency resolution process. An attacker publishes a malicious package with the same name as a dependency that does not exist in the official repository.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to publish packages to the pypi.org repository. They also need to know or discover that a particular software is using a nonexistent package name in the dependency list.
