The provided content describes a Remote Command Execution (RCE) vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `save` method in `com/key/dwsurvey/action/sysuser/SysPropertyAction.java` directly accepts parameters from the client and writes them into a configuration file (`admin-info.jsp`), which is then included in `login.jsp`. This allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unsanitized user input: The application does not sanitize or validate the input before writing it to a file.
- Direct file writing: The `writeData` method writes directly to a file, allowing an attacker to control the file contents.
- File inclusion vulnerability: The `login.jsp` file includes the attacker-controlled `admin-info.jsp` file, which leads to arbitrary code execution.
- Inadequate input filtering: The `xssEncode` method can be bypassed by manipulating the URI path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote code execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server by injecting malicious code into the configuration file.
- Complete system compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to complete server control.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request: The attacker sends a crafted POST request to `/design/../diaowen/sy/system/sys-property!save.action` with malicious code in the `adminTelephone` parameter.
- URI manipulation: The attacker bypasses the input filter by adding `/design/..` to the URI.
- File Inclusion: The vulnerable application includes the manipulated configuration file, leading to code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target server.
- No authentication is mentioned in the vulnerability details, suggesting that this might be unauthenticated or require only minimal authentication.
