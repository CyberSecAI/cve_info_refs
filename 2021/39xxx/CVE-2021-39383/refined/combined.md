| The save method in the com/key/dwsurvey/action/sysuser/SysPropertyAction.java file directly accepts the parameters passed from the client and writes them into the specified configuration file, which is directly included in login.jsp, resulting in rce  A file write operation was performed on the specified file in the writeData method [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/50451123/129505365-5030a4ea-86be-4329-8ca0-f03948183132.png) In the save method, the writeData method is invoked to write the admin-info.jsp, and the adminInfo variable comes from the assignment at the beginning of the Sava method.
