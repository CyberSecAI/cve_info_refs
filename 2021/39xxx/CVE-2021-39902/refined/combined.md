# Severity of an incident can be changed by a guest user

**[HackerOne report #1341674](https://hackerone.com/reports/1341674)** by `cradlr` on 2021-09-16, assigned to [@ngeorge1](/ngeorge1 "Nikhil George"):

[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

##### Summary

The severity of an incident can be changed by a guest user due to privilege escalation.

##### Steps to reproduce

1. Create 2 accounts on Gitlab.com. Create a group and invite another member to the group as an owner.
2. Create a project under the group.
3. From the invited user's session Go to Groups->Projects->Monitor->Create Incident.
4. Create an incident and then choose the severity of that incident. Capture the request in Burp and send it to repeater.
5. From the main user's session demote the user to Guest. Change the severity to low from the first user.
6. Refresh the 2nd user's session. Now the 2nd user cannot change the severity.
7. Fire the request from repeater. Severity gets changed.

Thanks,

Cradlr

#### Impact

Un-authorized user's can change the severity of the incident.
