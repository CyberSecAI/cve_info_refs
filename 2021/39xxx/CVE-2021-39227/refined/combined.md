# Prototype Pollution in zrender

Low

[pissang](/pissang)
published
GHSA-fhv8-fx5f-7fxf
Sep 17, 2021

## Package

npm

zrender
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 5.2.0, <= 4.3.2

## Patched versions

5.2.1, 4.3.3

## Description

### Impact

Using `merge` and `clone` helper methods in the `src/core/util.ts` module will have prototype pollution. It will affect the popular data visualization library Apache ECharts, which is using and exported these two methods directly.

### Patches

It has been patched in [#826](https://github.com/ecomfe/zrender/pull/826).

Users should update zrender to `5.2.1`. and update echarts to `5.2.1` if project is using echarts.
