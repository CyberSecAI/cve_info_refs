Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-39227

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from prototype pollution in the `merge` and `clone` helper methods within the `src/core/util.ts` module of the zrender library. These methods, when used to merge or clone objects, don't properly sanitize the input, allowing an attacker to inject properties into the prototype of the base object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Prototype Pollution:** The `merge` and `clone` functions in `src/core/util.ts` are vulnerable to prototype pollution, which occurs when an attacker can modify the prototype of an object, potentially affecting all objects inheriting from that prototype. Specifically, the vulnerability arises due to the lack of sanitization of input when merging or cloning objects, allowing the injection of properties like "__proto__".
- **Unsafe Object Manipulation:** The code allows the modification of object prototypes through the vulnerable merge and clone utilities, instead of only modifying the objects themselves.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Application Instability:** Prototype pollution can lead to unexpected behavior and application instability due to modified prototypes.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can potentially cause a denial of service by modifying prototypes in a way that causes the application to crash or become unresponsive.
- **Code Execution:**  In some environments or configurations, prototype pollution can be exploited to achieve remote code execution, although the documents here don't give any information on if this is a possible consequence of this vulnerability.
- **Data tampering/corruption:** Modifying the prototypes can potentially affect how data is handled, potentially leading to corruption.
- **Impact on dependent libraries:** The vulnerability also affects Apache ECharts, which depends on zrender.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Input:** An attacker can exploit this by providing specially crafted JSON input containing `__proto__` keys to the vulnerable `merge` and `clone` functions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the data that is being merged or cloned using the vulnerable methods, which would mean the attacker would need to be able to send the crafted payloads into the program when the program is using the library.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in zrender versions 5.2.1 and 4.3.3.
- The vulnerability is tracked as CWE-1321 (Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype).
- The provided pull request (#826) shows the fix, which involves excluding the `__proto__` key during the merge/clone process.
- A proof of concept (POC) is provided, illustrating how an attacker can use a crafted JSON payload to pollute the prototype.
```javascript
// poc.js
const zrender = require('zrender');
const obj = {};
const payload =  JSON.parse('{"__proto__":{"polluted":"Polluted!"}}');

console.log("Before: " + obj.polluted);
zrender.util.merge(obj, payload);
console.log("After: " + obj.polluted);
```
