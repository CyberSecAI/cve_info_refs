Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-39245:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The `getlogs.cgi` script is protected by HTTP Basic Authentication using hardcoded credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The username `altus` and password `nexto1234` are hardcoded in the `/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd-auth.conf` file. These credentials are used to access the `getlogs.cgi` script.
*   **Shared Credentials:** The hardcoded credentials are the same across all firmware images for the NX30xx, HX30xx, and XP3xx series.
*   **Unchangeable Credentials:** These credentials cannot be modified via the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can bypass the application-level user authentication and gain access to the `getlogs.cgi` script using the hardcoded credentials.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Combined with the command injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-39244) in the same script, an attacker can achieve full system compromise with only network access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:**  The primary attack vector is network access to the web interface of the affected devices.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs network access to the affected device.
*   The attacker needs to use the hardcoded credentials (`altus:nexto1234`) in the HTTP Basic Authentication header to access the `getlogs.cgi` script.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in the `lighttpd` webserver configuration used by the affected devices.
*   The credentials are used specifically for the `getlogs.cgi` script, which allows users to start `tcpdump`.
*   The advisory highlights that the hardcoded credentials, when combined with command injection, allow full system compromise.
*   The vulnerability was manually verified on an emulated device.
*   The advisory also mentions related vulnerabilities including a CSRF (CVE-2021-39243) vulnerability affecting the web interface.
