{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition exists in C2AllocatorIo. Multiple threads can access the same member of the mMappings list simultaneously without proper synchronization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition leading to potential memory corruption or data inconsistency.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Information Disclosure",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attack by multiple threads accessing the same data structure concurrently.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs the ability to create and execute multiple threads that can access the C2AllocatorIo class."
