Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39360:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the **lack of TLS certificate verification** in `libzapojit` when creating `SoupSessionSync` objects. This means that the library, by default, would not validate the authenticity of the server it's communicating with, potentially opening it up to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing TLS Certificate Verification:** The primary weakness is the failure to verify the SSL/TLS certificates of the servers `libzapojit` connects to. This can happen because the deprecated `SoupSessionSync` class, when used, does not enable TLS certificate verification by default.
- **Use of Deprecated API:** The use of the deprecated `SoupSessionSync` class from `libsoup` is the underlying cause for the lack of default certificate validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attacks:** An attacker could intercept network traffic between the application using `libzapojit` and the OneDrive/Hotmail servers, impersonating the legitimate server and potentially stealing user credentials or modifying data.
- **Data Exposure:**  Sensitive information could be exposed if an attacker is able to establish a connection to a malicious server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network Interception:** An attacker would need to be in a position to intercept the network traffic between the vulnerable application and the server. This could be achieved on a shared network (like public Wi-Fi) or through compromised routers.
- **Malicious Server Impersonation:** The attacker would then impersonate the legitimate server by presenting a fraudulent SSL certificate, which the vulnerable application wouldn't validate due to missing TLS certificate verification.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept the network traffic between the application and the server (MitM position).
- **Malicious Server Setup:** The attacker must have a malicious server setup which is configured to impersonate the legitimate server and present a fake certificate.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was identified in `zpj-skydrive.c` of `libzapojit`.
- The issue stems from the usage of `SoupSessionSync` which does not enable certificate verification by default.
- The issue is not in `libsoup` itself but in how `libzapojit` is using the deprecated API. `libsoup`'s modern `SoupSession` class is secure by default.
- The fix involves setting  `SoupSession:tls-database`, `SoupSession:ssl-use-system-ca-file`, or `SoupSession:ssl-ca-file` when using `SoupSessionSync` or using the modern `SoupSession` class instead, which has secure defaults.
- The blog post by Michael Catanzaro confirms that the deprecated classes, `SoupSessionSync` and `SoupSessionAsync`, default to no TLS certificate verification and this is not a bug in the library itself but an old API decision.
- Patches were released for Fedora 33, 34, and 35 to address this issue.
