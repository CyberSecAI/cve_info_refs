Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39340:

**1. Verification:**
   - The content from `wordfence.com` explicitly mentions `CVE-2021-39340` in relation to the "Notification – Custom Notifications and Alerts for WordPress" plugin. This confirms the content is relevant to the specified CVE. The other content is unrelated.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is **insufficient input validation and sanitization** of several parameters within the `~/src/classes/Utils/Settings.php` file of the "Notification" plugin.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input allows for the injection of arbitrary web scripts that are stored in the plugin's settings.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will execute in the browser of a user accessing a page displaying the plugin settings or associated features.
   - **Account Compromise:**  XSS vulnerabilities can be leveraged to steal session cookies or perform actions on behalf of an authenticated administrator.
   - **Malware Injection:** Attackers could use XSS to redirect users to malicious websites or serve malware.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Web Interface:**  The vulnerability is triggered through the plugin's admin interface in the settings.
   - **Payload Injection:**  Attackers inject malicious JavaScript via susceptible parameters/fields.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Administrative Access:** The attacker requires administrative privileges to modify settings within the plugin’s interface to exploit the XSS vulnerability in default scenarios.
   - **Multi-site installations/Specific Configurations:**  The vulnerability is particularly impactful for multi-site installations where `unfiltered_html` is disabled for administrators, and sites where `unfiltered_html` is disabled. This suggests that by default, those with admin access might not be directly affected because they can use unfiltered HTML without being sanitized.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in the `~/src/classes/Utils/Settings.php` file
- The vulnerable parameters are not specifically named but are related to settings in the class.
- The identified CVE is for versions <= 7.2.4.
