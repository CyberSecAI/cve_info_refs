- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Adobe SVG-Native-Viewer Library.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring a user to interact with a crafted SVG file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a crafted SVG file and the victim needs to open this SVG file using a vulnerable version of the Adobe SVG-Native-Viewer library. The attacker does not require any privileges.
