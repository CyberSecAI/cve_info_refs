Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39353:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content contains a specific entry for "Easy Registration Forms <= 2.1.1 Cross-Site Request Forgery to Stored Cross-Site Scripting" with the matching CVE ID: CVE-2021-39353
   - The content from plugins.trac.wordpress.org references the file `/easy-registration-forms/tags/2.1.1/includes/class-form.php` which is associated with the Easy Registration Forms plugin.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from missing nonce validation in the `ajax_add_form` function located in the `class-form.php` file of the Easy Registration Forms plugin.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The lack of nonce validation allows an attacker to forge requests that can perform actions on behalf of a logged-in administrator.
   - **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, the attacker can inject malicious web scripts that will be stored and executed within the application.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable WordPress site. This can lead to actions like:
     - Website Defacement
     - Redirection to malicious websites.
     - Stealing cookies and session tokens
     - Compromising admin accounts

**5. Attack Vectors:**

    - **Network:** Attackers can leverage the web to send crafted requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
    - **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a malicious link that will execute the forged request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Unauthenticated attacker:** The attacker does not need to be logged into the WordPress site to exploit the vulnerability.
   - **Ability to Craft Forged Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to create malicious requests that target the `ajax_add_form` endpoint in the `class-form.php` file.
   - **Social Engineering:** Requires the attacker to lure an administrator to trigger the attack

**Summary**

The Easy Registration Forms plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) due to a lack of nonce validation in the `ajax_add_form` function.  By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, an unauthenticated attacker can inject malicious javascript code via a forged request if the administrator is tricked to perform a malicious action like clicking on a link, thus allowing for a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.
