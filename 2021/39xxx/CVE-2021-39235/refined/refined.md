- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Ozone Datanode does not check the access mode parameter of block tokens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of access mode validation on block tokens, allowing unauthorized write operations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Authenticated users with a valid READ block token can perform write operations on the same block, potentially leading to data corruption or unauthorized modifications.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker with a valid READ block token can exploit this vulnerability to write to the block.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with a valid READ block token.
