The provided content is related to a dynamic stack buffer overflow vulnerability in `slaxlexer.c` at line 955.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A dynamic stack buffer overflow occurs in the `slaxLexer` function at `slaxlexer.c:955`. This is due to the use of `memcpy` without proper bounds checking when copying data to the stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow. Specifically, there's an overflow when copying data into a stack allocated buffer in `slaxLexer` at line 955.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability results in a crash due to AddressSanitizer detecting a dynamic stack buffer overflow, but it can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited without ASan.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input to `slaxproc`, the program that uses `libslax`. The specific input to trigger this issue involves causing the `slaxLexer` function at line 955 to copy more data than allocated for the stack buffer.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the `slaxproc` program.
- The attacker needs to craft the input data in a way that causes an overflow in the `slaxLexer` function.
- The attacker can achieve this through command line arguments or by processing a malicious file.

The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description. It includes the specific file and line number where the vulnerability is present, the function involved, stack traces, and a proof-of-concept zip file.
