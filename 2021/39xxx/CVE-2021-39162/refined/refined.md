Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect state transition within Envoy when handling HTTP/2 (H/2) frames.
- Specifically, the issue occurs when Envoy receives a GOAWAY frame, which transitions the connection to a CLOSED state, followed by a SETTINGS frame with the `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` parameter set to 0.
- This specific sequence of frames within the same I/O event triggers an invalid state transition from CLOSED to DRAINING, leading to abnormal termination of the Envoy process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect State Management:** The primary weakness is the failure to properly manage the state transitions within the H/2 connection handling logic. The code does not anticipate or handle the sequence of GOAWAY followed by SETTINGS frames in the expected way.
- **Race Condition:** The vulnerability is triggered by receiving these frames within the same I/O event, indicating a race condition between the processing of these frames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in a denial-of-service condition. The Envoy process terminates abnormally, disrupting the service it provides.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by a sequence of crafted H/2 frames sent by an **untrusted upstream server**.
- The attacker needs to send a GOAWAY frame followed by a SETTINGS frame with the parameter `SETTINGS_MAX_CONCURRENT_STREAMS` set to 0 in the same I/O event.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be an untrusted upstream server that is able to establish an H/2 connection with the vulnerable Envoy instance.
- The attacker must be able to send the specific H/2 frame sequence to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 8.6, categorized as High severity.
- The issue is present in Envoy versions 1.19.0 and 1.18.3.
- It is fixed in Envoy versions 1.19.1 and 1.18.4.
- Pomerium, which is based on Envoy, is also vulnerable in version 0.15.0 and the fix is in version 0.15.1.
- The CVE ID for the vulnerability in Envoy is CVE-2021-32780, however, the CVE ID for the vulnerability in Pomerium is CVE-2021-39162
