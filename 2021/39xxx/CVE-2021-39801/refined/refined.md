Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39801:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a use-after-free condition that occurs within the ION (Inter-Process Communication) subsystem in the Linux kernel. Specifically, the issue arises when a user attempts to free an ION handle during an ION allocation operation (specifically during `ION_IOC_ALLOC`), and the `copy_to_user` operation fails after allocation. The cleanup code would then attempt to free an already-freed handle.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use-after-free:** The core issue is a double-free vulnerability. The ION handle is freed prematurely under specific error conditions (`copy_to_user` failing), leading to a situation where the cleanup code tries to free the same handle again, which has already been freed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to local privilege escalation. By triggering the use-after-free condition, an attacker could potentially corrupt memory, leading to arbitrary code execution within the kernel and gain elevated privileges on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local exploitation:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a local user on the system, by making specific IOCTL calls to the ION driver. A malicious application could trigger this bug by calling `ION_IOC_ALLOC` followed by a call to `ION_IOC_FREE` under the conditions described.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the Android system to be able to call the IOCTLs to interact with the ION driver.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided commit messages detail the fix for the vulnerability involving changes in how ION handles are managed to prevent the double-free scenario. The fix introduces a wrapper for `ion_alloc` that adds an `ion_handle_get` to prevent the issue.
*   The fix also includes changes to protect the kref from user space manipulation by separating the user-space kref from the internally used kref. User-space requests via `ioctl` will hold at most one reference to the internally used kref. Additional requests increment a separate counter, and the original reference is put only when the counter hits 0. This protects the kernel from a misbehaving user-space program.
*   The fix also contains a change where the `kref_put` of an ION handle is done only after its final use.
