{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The project export functionality included trigger tokens in the exported `project.json` file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Exposure of sensitive information (trigger tokens) through project export."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who is a maintainer of a project can obtain trigger tokens of other maintainers and use these tokens to impersonate the victim, gaining access to all repositories the victim has access to and executing CI/CD jobs under their context.",
   "Attack vectors": [
      "Attacker must be a project maintainer.",
      "Attacker initiates project export and extracts tokens from the `project.json` file within the export archive."
   ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be a maintainer of the project to perform an export of the repository."
}
