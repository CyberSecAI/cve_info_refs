Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39377:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content from `github.com_64e00a5b_20250115_094939.html` directly references `CVE-2021-39377`. It also provides a detailed description of the SQL injection vulnerability, including vulnerable parameters, sample payloads, and affected software versions. The content confirms the relevance to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   - **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `username` parameter in the `index.php` file. This allows a malicious actor to inject SQL commands into the database query.
   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** SQL Injection vulnerability. Specifically, the `username` parameter in the login form is susceptible.
   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
      - Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL commands on the database server.
      - This can lead to:
        - Data breaches (access to sensitive student and staff data).
        - Data manipulation (altering or deleting data).
        - Potential complete compromise of the database server.
   - **Attack Vectors:**
      - The attack vector is a crafted HTTP POST request to the `index.php` page, injecting malicious SQL code via the `username` parameter.
   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable openSIS application.
      - No prior authentication is needed to exploit the vulnerability.
      - The attacker also needs to know that the application uses MySQL as it's backend.

**3. Technical Details:**

   - **Vulnerable PHP Page:** `index.php` (specifically the `username` parameter)
   - **Affected Software:** openSIS version 8.0 (when using MySQL or MariaDB)
   - **Vulnerable Payload Examples (from the Github content):**
     - Error-based payload:
        ```
        USERNAME=admin') AND (SELECT 4391 FROM(SELECT COUNT(*),CONCAT(0x71716b7071,(SELECT (ELT(4391=4391,1))),0x716b717071,FLOOR(RAND(0)*2))x FROM INFORMATION_SCHEMA.PLUGINS GROUP BY x)a)-- IzoO&PASSWORD=test1234!&language=en&log=
        ```
     - Time-based blind payload:
        ```
        USERNAME=admin') AND (SELECT 2137 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))BwzJ)-- sbsL&PASSWORD=test1234!&language=en&log=
        ```
   - **SQLMap Usage Example:**
     ```
     sqlmap "<http://localhost:8081/index.php>" --users --data="USERNAME=admin&PASSWORD=test1234%21&language=en&log=" --dbms="MySQL" --level=3 --risk=2
     ```
     This SQLMap command is used to automate the exploitation process and enumerate the database users.

**4. Additional Notes:**

   - The Github content provides a very clear explanation of how to exploit the vulnerability with sqlmap, including specific payloads.
   - The GitHub repository `security-n/CVE-2021-39377` was created specifically to document this vulnerability.
   - The OS4ED/openSIS-Classic GitHub repository contains the source code of the affected software, which is identified as a community edition version 9.0 and later, which is a version after the affected version in this CVE and not related to the vulnerability of version 8.0.

In summary, the provided content from `github.com_64e00a5b_20250115_094939.html` confirms the presence of an SQL injection vulnerability in openSIS version 8.0, providing technical details, payloads, and the affected component.
