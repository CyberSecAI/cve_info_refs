Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-39209

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a bypassable CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection mechanism on AJAX endpoints within the GLPI application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the inadequate implementation of CSRF protection, allowing malicious requests to be initiated from a different domain than the vulnerable application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Actions:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to perform actions within the GLPI application on behalf of a logged-in user. This includes any action that the user is authorized to perform.
- **Data Manipulation:** A malicious website could be used to modify or delete data within the GLPI system.
- **System takeover:** Depending on user permissions, a malicious actor might be able to fully compromise a GLPI system by changing configurations or creating malicious admin users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Website:** The attack vector involves a malicious website that the victim user visits while being logged into GLPI.
- **AJAX Endpoints:** The vulnerability specifically affects AJAX endpoints, indicating that the requests are made using JavaScript.
- **CSRF Token Bypass:** The attacker is able to bypass the CSRF protection mechanism, likely through some flaw in its implementation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Victim logged into GLPI:** The attacker requires the target user to be logged into their GLPI session.
- **Knowledge of GLPI AJAX endpoints:** The attacker needs to know which AJAX endpoints to target in order to perform desired actions.
- **Ability to craft malicious requests:**  The attacker needs to be able to craft the malicious AJAX requests that bypass the CSRF protection.
- **External website hosting:** The attacker needs the ability to host the malicious website.
