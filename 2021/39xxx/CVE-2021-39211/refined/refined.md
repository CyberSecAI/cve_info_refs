**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the presence of a telemetry endpoint (`ajax/telemetry.php`) in GLPI. This endpoint discloses GLPI and server information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is the exposure of sensitive information about the GLPI instance and the server it's running on. The exact nature of the information disclosed is not specified.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially gain valuable insights about the GLPI installation and server environment. This information could then be used in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is accessing the `ajax/telemetry.php` endpoint. This suggests that the endpoint was publicly accessible without any authentication or authorization checks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to access the GLPI instance's web server to reach the vulnerable `ajax/telemetry.php` file. No specific authentication or authorization is mentioned as a requirement.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue affects all GLPI versions since 9.2.
*   The vulnerability is resolved in version 9.5.6.
*   A workaround is provided to remove the vulnerable file (`ajax/telemetry.php`).
