Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39194:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `kaml` library's handling of polymorphic deserialization with tagged polymorphism. Specifically, when a YAML input provides a tag for a polymorphic type but omits the corresponding value for the object, the deserialization process enters an infinite loop.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Infinite Loop:** The core weakness is the potential for an infinite loop during YAML parsing. This is triggered when a tagged polymorphic type lacks a value after the tag.
- **Resource Starvation:** The infinite loop leads to resource exhaustion, specifically 100% CPU usage, effectively causing a denial of service.
- **Improper Input Handling:** The library does not handle the case where a tag is provided without a value, resulting in the infinite loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can cause a denial of service by providing malicious YAML input to an application using the vulnerable version of `kaml`.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** The application will consume excessive CPU resources, potentially crashing or becoming unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker can send malicious YAML input over the network to a vulnerable application.
- **Arbitrary Input:** The vulnerability requires the ability to provide arbitrary YAML input to the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send YAML input to a system using the vulnerable version of `kaml`.
- No special privileges are required on the server side to trigger the vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The issue affects `kaml` versions prior to 0.35.3.
- The vulnerability specifically impacts applications utilizing polymorphic serialization with the default tagged polymorphism style.
- The issue is triggered by YAML input that provides a tag but no value for a polymorphic object (e.g., `!<x>`).
- The provided example code demonstrates the vulnerability where the `decodeFromString()` operation hangs indefinitely.
- The fix for this issue was introduced in version 0.35.3.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as "Moderate" severity with a CVSS score of 4.3
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-230 (Improper Handling of Insufficiently Large Data).
- The issue was reported by @ukarlsson and fixed by @charleskorn.
