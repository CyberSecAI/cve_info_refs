# File path disclosure of shared files in OfficeOnline application

Low

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-56wm-r6jm-3v9h
Oct 25, 2021

## Package

OfficeOnline
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 1.1.1

## Patched versions

1.1.1

## Description

### Impact

The Nextcloud OfficeOnline application did return verbatim exception messages to the user. This could result in a full path disclosure on shared files. (e.g. an attacker could see that the file `shared.txt` is located within `/files/$username/Myfolder/Mysubfolder/shared.txt`)

### Patches

It is recommended that the OfficeOnline application is upgraded to 1.1.1.

### Workarounds

Disable the OfficeOnline application in the app settings.
