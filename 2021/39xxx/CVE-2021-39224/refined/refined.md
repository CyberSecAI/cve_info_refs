Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39224:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Nextcloud OfficeOnline application was returning verbatim exception messages to the user. This caused the application to disclose full file paths of shared files to users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The application revealed sensitive information (full file paths) in error messages.
- Lack of Proper Error Handling: The application did not sanitize or redact error messages before displaying them to users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could learn the full file path of shared files on the server. This could expose the underlying directory structure and potentially provide information useful for further attacks. For example, an attacker could see that the file `shared.txt` is located within `/files/$username/Myfolder/Mysubfolder/shared.txt`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by an error occurring while using the OfficeOnline application with shared files. The specific error condition is not explicitly detailed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the Nextcloud instance and have the ability to trigger an error within the OfficeOnline application. This likely requires being a user with access to shared files.
- No specific privileges are mentioned, implying that any user with access to shared files can potentially trigger the vulnerability.
