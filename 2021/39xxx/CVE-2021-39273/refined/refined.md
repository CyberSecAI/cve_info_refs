Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39273:

**Vulnerability Description**
The provided content describes two related vulnerabilities in Sn1per v9.0 (free version), which are tracked as CVE-2021-39273 and CVE-2021-39274. Both vulnerabilities stem from insecure file permissions, allowing unprivileged users to modify application files and gain arbitrary code execution with root privileges.

**CVE-2021-39273 Details**

*   **Root Cause:** Insecure permissions (0777) are set on the installation directory and its contents upon application execution. This occurs within the `init` function of the main `sniper` script.
    *Specifically, lines 464-466 of the `sniper` script are the root cause of this vulnerability:
    ```
    chmod 777 -Rf $INSTALL_DIR 2> /dev/null
    chown root $INSTALL_DIR/sniper 2> /dev/null
    chmod 4777 $INSTALL_DIR/sniper 2> /dev/null
    ```
*   **Weaknesses:** The vulnerability lies in the overly permissive file permissions (777) granted to the Sn1per installation directory, making all files within writable by any user.
*   **Impact:** An unprivileged user can modify any application files, including scripts and configuration files. By inserting malicious code or backdoors into these files, the attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution with root privileges the next time the application is run by root.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with local access to the system can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have a non-root user account on the system where Sn1per is installed to modify the vulnerable files. The attacker does not need to be root at the time of the initial exploit, only when the modified script is run by the root user.

**CVE-2021-39274 Details**
*   **Root Cause:**  Insecure directory permissions (0777) are set on the installation directory during the initial installation process.
    *   Specifically, lines 37-40 of the `install.sh` script are the root cause of the vulnerability:
    ```
    mkdir -p $INSTALL_DIR 2> /dev/null
    chmod 777 -Rf $INSTALL_DIR 2> /dev/null
    chown root $INSTALL_DIR/sniper 2> /dev/null
    chmod 4777 $INSTALL_DIR/sniper 2> /dev/null
    ```
*   **Weaknesses:** Similar to CVE-2021-39273, this is due to overly permissive directory permissions which are set during the installation.
*   **Impact:** Similar to CVE-2021-39273, this allows modification of the application files, leading to arbitrary code execution with root privileges when the application is run by root.
*   **Attack Vector:** An attacker with local access to the system can exploit this vulnerability by modifying files after the initial installation.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to have a non-root user account on the system where Sn1per is installed to modify the vulnerable files. The attacker does not need to be root at the time of the initial exploit, only when the modified script is run by the root user.

**Additional Information**
*   The vulnerable application is Sn1per v9.0 free version.
*   The vulnerabilities were tested on Ubuntu 21.04.
*   The report suggests that a stealthy approach would be to add a backdoor to the `sniper.conf` file, which is sourced by the main script.

**Summary**

Both CVE-2021-39273 and CVE-2021-39274 describe the same underlying issue: insecure file permissions (777), but the former happens upon first execution of the main application script while the latter is set immediately after the installation, allowing an unprivileged user to modify application files and achieve root-level code execution when a root user runs the modified application.
