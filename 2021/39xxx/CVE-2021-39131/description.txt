ced detects character encoding using Google’s compact_enc_det library. In ced v0.1.0, passing data types other than `Buffer` causes the Node.js process to crash. The problem has been patched in ced v1.0.0. As a workaround, before passing an argument to ced, verify it’s a `Buffer` using `Buffer.isBuffer(obj)`.
