The content is related to CVE-2021-39131.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of unexpected data types in the `ced` library. Specifically, the library does not properly validate that the input argument is a `Buffer` object.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `ced` library in version 0.1.0 lacks proper input validation, and does not check if the argument passed to the `detectEncoding` function is a `Buffer`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Passing data types other than `Buffer` to the `ced` library results in a crash of the Node.js process. This leads to a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send crafted requests with non-buffer data to a server using the vulnerable `ced` library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker can be unauthenticated and does not require any specific privileges.
- The attacker must be able to send network requests to the service running the vulnerable library.
