Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from multiple weaknesses in IBM Spectrum Protect Plus, specifically Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF), Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack, and Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** This vulnerability allows an attacker to induce the server to make requests to arbitrary internal or external systems.
*  **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack:** This vulnerability allows an attacker to intercept and potentially alter communications between the client and the server.
*   **Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS):** This vulnerability may allow a malicious website to access resources from the vulnerable IBM Spectrum Protect Plus instance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   The provided document doesn't provide the specific impact of the attacks, but based on common knowledge of the attack types:
    *   **SSRF** could lead to internal information disclosure, access to internal services, or even denial of service if the server makes requests to a system it shouldn't.
    *   **MITM** could result in data interception, modification, and even the injection of malicious content, compromising data confidentiality and integrity.
    *  **CORS** related flaws can lead to sensitive information disclosure or unauthorized actions performed on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The specific attack vectors for each vulnerability are not detailed in this document, but generally:
    *   **SSRF** is typically exploited by manipulating input to the vulnerable server so it makes requests to attacker-controlled URLs or internal services.
    *   **MITM** is typically achieved by placing an attacker-controlled system between the client and server. This can be done via network-level attacks, DNS poisoning, or ARP spoofing.
    * **CORS** is typically achieved by tricking user's browser to make requests to the server with malicious origin header

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker's required capabilities and position are not explicitly stated, but based on the nature of the attacks:
    *   For **SSRF**, the attacker needs to be able to influence the server to make requests to arbitrary URLs. This could potentially be done remotely if the application has an interface that accepts URLs as parameters.
    *  For **MITM**, the attacker needs to be positioned in the network path between the client and server.
    *  For **CORS**, the attacker needs to have the ability to host malicious website and trick the user to access the malicious website.
    

**Affected Products and Versions:**
* IBM Spectrum Protect Plus versions 10.1.0.0 to 10.1.8.x are vulnerable

**Resolution:**
* Upgrade to IBM Spectrum Protect Plus version 10.1.9
