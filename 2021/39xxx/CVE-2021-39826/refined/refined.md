- **Root cause of vulnerability**: OS Command Injection
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The application is vulnerable to OS command injection, allowing execution of arbitrary commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows for arbitrary code execution on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the machine. The user needs to perform an action (User Interaction: Required) that triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the machine and the ability to induce a user to perform an action that triggers the vulnerable code path.
