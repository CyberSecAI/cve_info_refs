I am very surprised to see that

- somewhere hidden in the release notes I see "It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to Jamf Pro 10.32.0 as soon as possible. This vulnerability has the potential to impact the integrity and availability of your web server." This is really a very bad way of communicating a critical vulnerability.

- the installer suddenly requires 150 GB of disk space? Are you kidding? And the installer silently quits, and I need to search for the reason.

I have my database on an external server, so I certainly don't need 150GB of free disk space to update the jss. Can someone tell me were I can fix the installer so I can update my JSS and secure my server and all the devices it configures?

It looks to me like it's only a recommendation to have 150GB free space. I successfully upgraded a test environment with only 40GB free.

Regarding the security vulnerabilities, given that we run a service with an SLA, we require information about whether an emergency change is required. Otherwise we have a 2 week wait for any break in service. So I need concrete information about whether the vulnerability affects us before submitting an ECR. For example, can the vulnerability penetrate through a load balancer when the Jamf Pro Servers themselves are protected by firewall?

It looks like this release, according to the release notes, patches 3 serious security vulnerabilities. Why is that not addressed up-front either in this post or why was no notice sent out about the vulnerabilities like the notice that was sent for the 10.30.1 release?

Upgraded from 10.30.3 to 10.32, no issues.

All seems ok.

I'm not sure how an organization goes about getting CVEs and registered through that system, but I feel like Jamf is large enough and in enough critical locations they really need to be issuing CVEs and real disclosure of security issues like this. Comparing 1 product or company to another isn't always the best BUT other management tools such as Workspace One, BigFix, Maas360, and MobileIron issue CVEs and this type of information correctly when they have issues.

I really love Jamf and wave the flag, but they're no longer a small company with a niche market share, they're THE tool for macOS management. It's a publicly traded company. They can't continue acting like some small startup.

I get why they aren't publicly releasing information yet. We need time to upgrade, and revealing the vulnerability in detail just makes that more urgent.

However, I would like to be contacted privately with some details, like a severity score and whether it affects on-premises and/or cloud, if load balancers are any protection, and whether we should be blocking access until we can upgrade, etc.

In fact, only one of our team were notified of the release of 10.32 by email at all, and the email was, according to my colleague, "very strange, in German, no images/logos, looked very much like spam". If he'd been on holiday I would possibly have no idea of the release. That's not good enough.

Dealing with the Microsoft Exchange issues the past few months has been scary for me, servers getting hacked and loaded with ransomware.

Any Internet facing server with a vulnerability is a giant risk. I patched immediately I don’t want to find a web shell sitting on my jamf server.

These vulnerabilities should have a CVE score so people know how to react.

As mentioned above. It would be nice to know if this is a on-premise situation only or does it affect cloud customers as well. I can only guess it's on-premise as we are cloud and our upgrade 10.32 is not scheduled until this coming Friday. ![:face_with_open_mouth:](/html/@AE9654406E1C011D082A91EE53274B47/emoticons/1f62e.png ":face_with_open_mouth:")

The CVEs mentioned above are applicable to on-prem and cloud environments. If a CVE is only relevant to a portion of our customers, that we clearly mark it as such.

To limit the chance of someone exploiting responsibly disclosed vulnerabilities while customer owned instances are still being patched, we restrict the full details on the CVE. In this particular case, Jamf Cloud customers aren't required to take any action in order to further safeguard their Jamf Pro instances. When you choose to host in Jamf Cloud we have additional mechanisms to ensure the security of your instances.

Shouldn't this important announcement be pinned at the top? I just happened to come across it after a LOT of scrolling.  Now I've got to put a Change Request in process as soon as possible to get our system patched.

I just logged in to read release notes and am seeing mention about the vuln there.  Was an email sent and this is another security related email I never got from jamf?  Customers shouldn't be expected to come to jamf.com to get info like this.

* [PI-006352] This release fixes a security vulnerability with Jamf Pro. It is strongly recommended that you upgrade to Jamf Pro 10.32.0 as soon as possible. This vulnerability has the potential to impact the integrity and availability of your web server. **More details will be communicated via email** and on Jamf Nation.

## Intro

When assessing an attack surface, we came across an instance of Jamf Pro installed on premise. To us, when we saw this paradigm of deploying Jamf Pro to the internet and having it externally exposed, our security research team was quite curious about potential vulnerabilities that existed within it.

In particular, we were interested in pre-authentication vulnerabilities, but after spending a huge chunk of time auditing the pre-authentication attack surface, we concluded that a pretty good job had been done at locking this down. Generally, we were impressed that we were not able to find any serious pre-authentication issues, and credit is due to Jamf for this.

However, when looking under the hood at some of the post-authentication functionalities that Jamf Pro had to offer, we discovered a server-side request forgery vulnerability within the Jamf product. This vulnerability also existed in Jamfâs SaaS offering (Jamf cloud) leading to AWS metadata access in Jamfâs account.

The CVEâs associated with the SSRF vulnerabilities discovered in Jamf Pro can be found below:

* [PI-006352] CVSS 8.3 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-39303>
* [PI-009921] CVSS 7.5 <https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-40809>

## What is Jamf Pro

Jamf Pro is an application used by system administrators to configure and automate IT administration tasks for macOS, iOS, iPadOS, and tvOS devices. Jamf offers on-premises and cloud-based mobile device management.

There are two deployment options for Jamf Pro, cloud (SaaS) and on-premise. In order to do this research, we obtained a copy of Jamf Pro on-premise.

Jamf Pro is one of the most popular MDM solutions for Apple products, and hence it was an attractive target to do source code analysis and vulnerability research on.

## Mapping out the attack surface

We went through every route defined in the <span class="code\_single-line">web.xml</span> file systematically and ruled out all of the pre-authentication attack surface. After doing this exercise and not discovering any serious issues, our team looked for sinks that could lead to dangerous functionality and then reverse engineered their way back up to the source. This proved to be a very effective mechanism when finding dangerous functionality inside Jamf regardless of whether or not authentication was required.

Due to our previous experiences with large enterprise products and SSRF, we decided to pinpoint what HTTP clients were in use by Jamf and then find all references to these HTTP clients. When auditing enterprise software, it is not uncommon to find a HTTP client wrapper that is used by the rest of the code base. This was the case for Jamf, where we found a HTTP client defined in <span class="code\_single-line">jamf.war.src/WEB-INF/classes/com/jamfsoftware/jss/utils/HTTPUtils.java</span>:

```

/*     */   public static ResponseBytes getBytesFromSSLMutualAuthEndpoint(String sslEndpoint, KeyManagerProvider keyManagerProvider, TrustManagerProvider trustManagerProvider) throws SSLEndpointException {
/*     */     SSLContext sslContext;
/*     */     ResponseBytes bytes;
/*     */     try {
/*  93 */       sslContext = SSLContext.getInstance("TLS");
/*  94 */       sslContext.init((keyManagerProvider == null) ? null : keyManagerProvider.getKeyManagers(), (trustManagerProvider == null) ? null : trustManagerProvider.getTrustManagers(), null);
/*  95 */     } catch (GeneralSecurityException e) {
/*  96 */       throw new SSLEndpointException(e);
/*     */     }
/*     */
/*  99 */     SSLConnectionSocketFactory sslsf = new SSLConnectionSocketFactory(sslContext);
/*     */
/* 101 */     HttpGet httpGet = new HttpGet(sslEndpoint);
/*     */
/*     */
/*     */     try {
/* 105 */       bytes = getBytes(sslEndpoint, sslsf, httpGet);
/* 106 */     } catch (Exception e) {
/* 107 */       throw new SSLEndpointException(e);
/*     */     }
/* 109 */     return bytes;
/*     */   }
/*     */
/*     */
/*     */
/*     */   private static ResponseBytes getBytes(String sslEndpoint, SSLConnectionSocketFactory sslsf, HttpGet httpGet) throws IOException, HttpException {
/* 115 */     CloseableHttpClient httpClient = HttpClients.custom().setSSLSocketFactory((LayeredConnectionSocketFactory)sslsf).build();
/*     */
/* 117 */     ResponseBytes bytes = new ResponseBytes();
/*     */     try {
/* 119 */       CloseableHttpResponse response = httpClient.execute((HttpUriRequest)httpGet);
/*     */       try {
/* 121 */         HttpEntity entity = response.getEntity();
/* 122 */         bytes.setBytes(EntityUtils.toByteArray(entity));
/* 123 */         bytes.setStatusCode(response.getStatusLine().getStatusCode());
/*     */       } finally {
/* 125 */         response.close();
/*     */       }
/*     */     } finally {
/* 128 */       httpClient.close();
/*     */     }
/* 130 */     return bytes;
/*     */   }
/*     */

As the source code suggests, the <span class="code_single-line">getBytes</span> function was the sink which was responsible for making the HTTP request.

With this in mind, we were able to discover numerous SSRF vulnerabilities that were possible to trigger once authenticated to Jamf. For this blog post, we will focus on the SSRF that had the most impact.

## Discovering the SSRF

Simply searching the entire code base for <span class="code_single-line">getBytesFromSSLMutualAuthEndpoint</span>, returned a single result in <span class="code_single-line">jamf.war.src/WEB-INF/classes/com/jamfsoftware/jss/edu/EducationStudentPhotoRepositoryImpl.java</span>:

```

/*     */   public EducationStudentPhotoRepository.ImageRetrievalData getBase64EncodedImageWithoutClientAuth(String url) {
/* 130 */     return getImage(url, null);
/*     */   }
/*     */   private EducationStudentPhotoRepository.ImageRetrievalData getImage(String url, KeyManagerProvider clientKeyManagerProvider) {
/*     */     HTTPUtils.ResponseBytes bytes;
/* 134 */     EducationStudentPhotoRepository.ImageRetrievalData.Builder dataBuilder = EducationStudentPhotoRepository.ImageRetrievalData.builder();
/*     */
/*     */
/*     */
/*     */     try {
/* 139 */       TrustManagerProvider tmp = getTrustManagerProvider();
/*     */
/* 141 */       bytes = HTTPUtils.getBytesFromSSLMutualAuthEndpoint(url, clientKeyManagerProvider, tmp);
/* 142 */     } catch (Exception e) {
/* 143 */       this.jamfLog.error("Error retrieving image for url " + url, e);
/* 144 */       return dataBuilder.setErrorMsg(UIErrorMessage.fromException(e).getMessage()).build();
/*     */     }
/*     */
/* 147 */     if (!HTTPUtils.is200Response(bytes.getStatusCode())) {
/* 148 */       this.jamfLog.error("Unable to load image at " + url + ", HTTP Status Code: " + bytes.getStatusCode());
/* 149 */       return dataBuilder.setErrorMsg(UIErrorMessage.fromStatusCode(bytes.getStatusCode()).getMessage()).build();
/*     */     }
/*     */
/* 152 */     if (!url.startsWith("https")) {
/* 153 */       dataBuilder.setErrorMsg(UIErrorMessage.INSECURE_HOST.getMessage());
/*     */     }
/*     */
/* 156 */     dataBuilder.setImage(Base64.encodeBase64String(bytes.getBytes()));
/* 157 */     return dataBuilder.build();
/*     */   }

In order to trace this function back to the source, we identified all usages of <span class="code_single-line">getBase64EncodedImageWithoutClientAuth</span> and discovered the following snippet of code in <span class="code_single-line">jamfsoftware/jss/edu/settings/EduFeatureSettingsTestHTMLResponse.java</span>:

```

/*     */   public ResponseStatus respondToAJAXRequest(Document xmldoc, Element root) {
/*  78 */     if ("ACTION_AJAX_REQUEST_PHOTO".equals(this.ajaxAction)) {
/*  79 */       EducationStudentPhotoRepositoryImpl photoRepo = new EducationStudentPhotoRepositoryImpl();
/*  80 */       String sslEndpoint = this.request.getParameter("imageUrl");
/*  88 */       EducationStudentPhotoRepository.ImageRetrievalData data = photoRepo.getBase64EncodedImageWithoutClientAuth(sslEndpoint);
/*     */
/*  90 */       if (data.retrievedImageWithoutError()) {
/*  91 */         XMLUtils.addErrorToXML(xmldoc, root, "base64Image", EducationStudentPhotoRepositoryImpl.UIErrorMessage.CLIENT_AUTH_NOT_ENABLED.getMessage());
/*     */       } else {
/*  93 */         data = photoRepo.getBase64EncodedImage(sslEndpoint);
/*     */       }
/*     */
/*  96 */       data.addImageAndErrors(xmldoc, root);
/*     */
/*  98 */       return ResponseStatus.REQUEST_PROCESSED_SUCCESSFULLY;
/*     */     }
/* 100 */     return ResponseStatus.BAD_REQUEST;
/*     */   }

Thankfully, it was quite easy to discover the affected endpoints due to hints in the codebase as to where this functionality existed:

```

/*     */   public EduFeatureSettingsTestHTMLResponse() {
/*  25 */     this.respondToURI = "eduFeatureSettingsTest.html";
/*  26 */     this.redirectParentURI = (new EduFeatureSettingsHTMLResponse()).getRespondToURI() + "?id=0&o=r";
/*     */
/*  28 */     this.includePageListObjects = "";
/*  29 */     this.includePageCRUDForObject = "eduFeatureSettingsTest.jsp";
/*     */
/*  31 */     this.targetObject = (CRUDObject)new EduFeatureSettings();
/*     */
/*  33 */     this.parentTabURI = "settings.html";
/*  34 */     this.selectedSideNavigationURI = "settings.html?mobileDevice";
/*     */
/*  36 */     this.primaryResponderForCrudObject = false;
/*     */   }

So, piecing it all together, we were able to exploit this SSRF by visiting the following URL as an authenticated user:

<span class="code_single-line">http://yourjamfinstance:8090/eduFeatureSettingsTest.html</span>

This resulted in a form that looked something like this:

![](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/64233a8baf1eba1d72a641d4/65a39ee58fbe31264ae640ac_edutest.png)

Sure, Iâll enter a URL in

Upon submitting this form with the URL <span class="code_single-line">http://example.com</span>, the following HTTP request was made:

```

## Impact and Response

While a post-authentication SSRF does not sound that exciting, since Jamf offer a cloud version of their software hosted on AWS, server-side request forgery vulnerabilities can have critical impact.

In this case, through the SSRF demonstrated in this blog post, it was possible to access the AWS metadata IP address and obtain temporary security credentials to Jamfâs AWS environment. After proving the concept of obtaining the AWS credentials for my own Jamf cloud instance, incident response kicked off on Jamfâs side.

Jamfâs AWS monitoring tools noticed the anomalous behaviour and an investigation was started. Their team recognized it was an SSRF after inspecting it and the IP address doing the behaviour was blocked. The Jamf Pro instance that the exploit was performed on was also disabled.

Until a more robust fix was in place, Jamf employed a web application firewall (WAF) rule that effectively blocked exploitation for all of Jamf cloud. A fix was merged into Jamf Pro RC within 3 days of exploitation.

Jamf have a well defined vulnerability disclosure process that we used to submit the vulnerability. They were responsive and gave the vulnerability the due dilligence necessary and worked on a fix very quickly. As a company, Jamf also enabled and encouraged disclosure of this issue.

## Remediation Advice

This vulnerability was patched in Jamf 10.32.

Please find the detail about this Jamf release here: <https://community.jamf.com/t5/jamf-pro/what-s-new-in-jamf-pro-10-32-release/m-p/246505>.

In order to remediate this vulnerability, we recommend upgrading to the latest version of Jamf Pro on premise.

## Conclusion

Often when assessing source code, it is important to focus on certain classes of issues and be as holistic as possible. While no pre-authentication vulnerabilities were found, serious vulnerabilities were discovered in Jamf Pro by focusing on a specific bug class (SSRF) and by tracing the vulnerability in a reverse fashion (sink to source).

While there were more instances of SSRF within Jamf Pro, the one discussed in this blog post had the most impact as the full HTTP response was returned for arbitrary URLs. Even though this vulnerability affected a component only available once authenticated to Jamf Pro, it had significant impact due to the architectural decisions of Jamf Cloud.

The Jamf security team had an excellent response to this vulnerability and we encourage others to report any security issues to Jamf. They went above and beyond when dealing with this disclosure and were a pleasure to work with.
