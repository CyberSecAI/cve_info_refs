Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-39303:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) issue found in the Jamf Pro application. Specifically, an authenticated user can make the Jamf server make arbitrary HTTP requests using a vulnerable endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unvalidated Input:** The `imageUrl` parameter in the `eduFeatureSettingsTest.html` endpoint is not properly validated before being used in an HTTP request. This allows an attacker to specify any URL, including internal resources.
- **SSRF:** The `getBytesFromSSLMutualAuthEndpoint` function fetches content from the provided URL without proper sanitization or restriction.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can use the SSRF to read the content of internal resources, such as the AWS metadata endpoint. This allows for the retrieval of sensitive information like temporary AWS security credentials, which in turn grants access to the Jamf's cloud infrastructure.
- **Potential for Further Attacks:** With access to internal resources and potentially AWS credentials, an attacker can further compromise the Jamf environment.
- **Impact to Availability and Integrity of Web Server**:  The vulnerability has the potential to impact the integrity and availability of the web server according to the release notes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `eduFeatureSettingsTest.html` endpoint within the Jamf Pro web application.
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to Jamf Pro to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker sends a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint, including a malicious URL in the `imageUrl` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a Jamf Pro instance.
- The attacker needs network access to the Jamf Pro server.
- No specific user role within Jamf Pro is specified, so it can be assumed that any authenticated user with access to the endpoint can exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- This vulnerability affects both on-premise and cloud deployments of Jamf Pro.
- Jamf's cloud infrastructure was affected due to the ability to access AWS metadata.
- The vulnerability was patched in Jamf Pro version 10.32.
- Jamf used a WAF rule as a temporary mitigation before the fix was released.
- The full HTTP response from the requested URL is returned in the base64Image XML tag, which allows an attacker to view the full contents of a fetched resource.
