### @mhertsch **[mhertsch](/mhertsch)** commented [Mar 9, 2017](#issue-213138607)

Hi,

we detected a memory issue with the latest version of detect-character-encoding and found that the documentation of ucsdet\_close specifically mentions:

(see: <http://icu-project.org/apiref/icu4c/ucsdet_8h.html#a84dab4d2c56fedb624a01db170ba698c>)

Close a charset detector. All storage and any other resources owned by this charset detector will be released. Failure to close a charset detector when finished with it can result in memory leaks in the application.

I tried my hand at fixing the issue. From what I could see, the code change fixed the leak.

Because Nan:ThrowError does not seem to break the execution order of the code in this file, and ucsdet\_open returns a null pointer in case of failure, it ought to be enough to close the charsetDetector at the end if it is not a nullptr and therefore was created successfully.

Regards,

Michael

| Because Nan:ThrowError does not seem to break the execution order of the code in this file  Thank you for mentioning this. This is a bug on its own, I have fixed it in [2e3aa33](https://github.com/sonicdoe/detect-character-encoding/commit/2e3aa333a573960edf2d782bca3b25a01e49678b).  By the way, because the base branch of this repository is `develop` (instead of `master`), I have rebased your branch onto `develop`. Consequently, your fork’s `master` branch may look a bit messy now.  You can take a look at the changes in [d443569](https://github.com/sonicdoe/detect-character-encoding/commit/d44356927b92e3b13e178071bf6d7c671766f588). If it looks good to you, I’ll release it as v0.3.1. |

# Missing Release of Memory after Effective Lifetime in detect-character-encoding

High

[sonicdoe](/sonicdoe)
published
GHSA-5rwj-j5m3-3chj
Aug 31, 2021

## Package

npm

detect-character-encoding
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

0.3.0

## Patched versions

0.3.1

## Description

### Impact

In detect-character-encoding v0.3.0 and earlier, allocated memory is not released.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in [detect-character-encoding v0.3.1](https://github.com/sonicdoe/detect-character-encoding/releases/tag/v0.3.1).

### CVSS score

[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/RL:O/RC:C)

Base Score: 7.5 (High)

Temporal Score: 7.2 (High)

Since detect-character-encoding is a library, the scoring is based on the “[reasonable worst-case implementation scenario](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/user-guide#3-7-Scoring-Vulnerabilities-in-Software-Libraries-and-Similar)”, namely, using detect-character-encoding in a program accessible over the internet which becomes unavailable when running out of memory. Depending on your specific implementation, the vulnerability’s severity in your program may be different.

### Proof of concept

```
const express = require("express");
const detectCharacterEncoding = require("detect-character-encoding");

const app = express();

app.get("/", (req, res) => {
  detectCharacterEncoding(Buffer.from("foo"));

  res.end();
});

app.listen(3000);
```

`hey -n 1000000 http://localhost:3000` ([`hey`](https://github.com/rakyll/hey)) causes the Node.js process to consume more and more memory.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
