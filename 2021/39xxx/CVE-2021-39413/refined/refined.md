Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-39413:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the SEO Panel application. Specifically, multiple PHP files fail to neutralize special characters when handling parameters in HTTP GET requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   **Vulnerable Parameters:** The identified vulnerable parameters include:
    *   `to_time`
    *   `from_time`
    *   `order_col`
    *    `pageno`
*   **Vulnerable Files:** Many files are affected, including:
    *   `backlinks.php`
    *   `analytics.php`
    *   `log.php`
    *   `overview.php`
    *   `pagespeed.php`
    *   `rank.php`
    *   `review.php`
    *   `saturationchecker.php`
    *   `social_media.php`
    *   `reports.php`
     *   `webmaster-tools.php`
     *   `alerts.php`
     *   `keywords.php`
     *    `proxy.php`
     *   `searchengine.php`
     *   `siteauditor.php`

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page rendered by the vulnerable SEO Panel application.
*   This injected script can execute in the context of the victim's browser session, enabling actions such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Cookie theft
    *   Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    *   Modifying content on the page
    *   Phishing attacks

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through crafted HTTP GET requests. The attacker manipulates the values of the vulnerable parameters, such as `to_time`, `from_time`, `order_col`, and `pageno`, by inserting malicious JavaScript code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable SEO Panel instance.
*   The attacker does not require any specific privileges on the server but needs to entice a user of the application to access the malicious URL
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable parameters and the application's URL structure.
