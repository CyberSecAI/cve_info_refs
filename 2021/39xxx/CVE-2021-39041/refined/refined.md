- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Common and TCPMultilineSyslog protocol components in IBM QRadar SIEM contain vulnerabilities that can be exploited for denial-of-service attacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Vulnerabilities in the Common and TCPMultilineSyslog protocol components.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vectors are not detailed, but the vulnerabilities are present in the Common and TCPMultilineSyslog protocol components of IBM QRadar SIEM, suggesting network-based attacks targeting these protocols.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The document doesn't specify, but it would require the ability to send network traffic that interacts with the vulnerable protocol components.
