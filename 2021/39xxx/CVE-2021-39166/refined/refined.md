Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39166:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper neutralization of text values within the object version preview feature of Pimcore. Text values were not properly escaped before being printed, leading to a vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper output escaping, which falls under CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting). Specifically, the vulnerability is a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An authenticated attacker, with access to resources that had version previews, could inject malicious scripts into text values. This injected code would then execute within the browser of other users viewing the object version preview. This can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the victimâ€™s browser and can lead to session hijacking, defacement, data theft, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the manipulation of text values within the object version data. An attacker would modify text values to include malicious JavaScript code. When a user views the version preview, the unescaped JavaScript will be executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker must be an authenticated user with the privilege to modify data and the access rights to see version previews.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Pimcore versions prior to 10.1.2.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #10170, which includes commits that properly encode the text values before displaying them in the version preview.
- The severity was rated as moderate.
