- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper protection against clickjacking attacks when the REST API discovery feature is enabled in WebSphere Application Server and WebSphere Application Server Liberty. This occurs either through the WebSphere administrative console or via specific Liberty features (mpOpenAPI-1.0, mpOpenAPI-1.1, mpOpenAPI-2.0, apiDiscovery-1.0, openapi-3.0 or openapi-3.1).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary weakness is the absence of clickjacking protection mechanisms for the REST API discovery functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to trick a user into unintentionally performing actions on the application, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data modification.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is clickjacking. An attacker can create a malicious website that loads the vulnerable application's page in a hidden iframe. The attacker then overlays a transparent layer of their design which entices the user to click.  These clicks are then passed through to the underlying iframed application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website and entice a user to visit it. The user must also be logged into the vulnerable application for a successful attack.
