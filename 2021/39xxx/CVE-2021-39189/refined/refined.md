Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39189:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the "lost password" functionality of the pimcore application. Prior to the fix, the application would display specific error messages depending on whether the submitted username existed in the system. This allowed an attacker to differentiate between valid and invalid usernames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Username Enumeration:** The primary weakness is the information disclosure via observable response discrepancy. The application's behavior differed based on whether the username was valid or not.  Specifically, error messages were shown for invalid usernames, while a success message was shown for existing usernames.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers could enumerate valid usernames by observing the application's responses to password reset requests. This information can be used in subsequent attacks, such as brute-force attacks on user passwords or targeted phishing campaigns.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Lost Password Form:** The attack vector is the "lost password" form of the pimcore application. An attacker would repeatedly submit usernames through this form, observing the application's response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No special access:** The attacker does not require any special access or privileges. They can exploit the vulnerability through the publicly available password reset functionality.
- **Network Access:** Attacker needs network access to the application to submit password reset requests.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix implemented by the patch is to remove the error message that reveals the validity of a username during the lost password process. Instead, a generic success message is displayed regardless of the input.
- The patch involves changes in `bundles/AdminBundle/Controller/Admin/LoginController.php` and `bundles/AdminBundle/Resources/views/Admin/Login/lostpassword.html.twig`, removing the error messages and displaying a success message to all request
- The vulnerability is assigned CWE-204: Improper Handling of  Response
