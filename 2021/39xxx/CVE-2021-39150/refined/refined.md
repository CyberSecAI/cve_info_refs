    "description": "XStream is vulnerable to an Arbitrary Code Execution attack. The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in execution of arbitrary code loaded from a remote server.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in XStream's deserialization process, where it uses type information from the input stream to create new object instances. This allows an attacker to manipulate the input stream and inject malicious objects that can execute arbitrary code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe deserialization",
      "Lack of proper input validation"

    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution on the server.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "Manipulation of XML or JSON input streams during deserialization."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to control or manipulate the data stream that is being processed by XStream.",
      "details": "This vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious objects into the deserialized data stream, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server processing the data. This occurs because XStream does not properly validate or sanitize type information in the input stream. Instead it relies on the provided information to create new object instances, opening a path to execute attacker-controlled code. The attacker can leverage a crafted XML or JSON payload, using any format supported by the XStream library. This input stream will include modified type information which, when deserialized, triggers the malicious code."
