  "CVE-2021-39925": {
    "description": "The Bluetooth SDP dissector could crash.",
    "vulnerability": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the Bluetooth SDP dissector.",
    "impact": "It may be possible to make Wireshark crash by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
    "attack_vector": "Maliciously crafted Bluetooth SDP packets. This can be achieved by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to craft and inject Bluetooth SDP packets or create a malformed packet trace file.",
        "details": "The vulnerability occurs due to the lack of length check on the `continuation_state_length` field when reassembling packets. A request packet inserts `tid_request` into a global object. The `continuation_state_length` field is read from the packet. A response packet retrieves the `tid_request` object. When `tid_request->continuation_state_length` is greater than 20, a heap overflow occurs via `memcpy`."
