```json
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that the project import functionality does not properly validate the access level specified in the `project_members.ndjson` file. A user with developer role can modify the access_level in this file to 'maintainer' before importing the project.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input validation",
      "Broken access control"
    ],
    "impact": "A developer can gain maintainer privileges on a project that they import, even if they were initially only a developer in the group where the project is imported. This allows the attacker to perform actions they are not supposed to, including adding deploy keys/tokens and modifying project settings.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Modifying exported project data",
       "Importing a manipulated project"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be a developer in a group and be able to export and import projects. They also need to be able to modify the `project_members.ndjson` file."
  }
