```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The default CORS configuration allows any origin with credentials due to the `anyOrigin` flag being true by default and the default `allowCredentials` also being true. This allows the server to approve sharing responses with sensitive information to any origin.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Origin reflection attack: The server reflects the origin in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` header, allowing a malicious site to access the resource.",
    "Null origin attack: The server responds with `Access-Control-Allow-Origin: null` when a request has `Origin: null`, potentially leading to the exfiltration of secrets."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious script can exfiltrate sensitive information using the user's credentials from the vulnerable server to a malicious domain.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "A malicious script on a separate domain initiates a cross-origin request to the vulnerable server using `XMLHttpRequest`.",
    "A request with a `null` origin made from a sandboxed iframe to the vulnerable server."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to host a malicious script on a domain that is different from the vulnerable server. The attacker also needs to be able to make cross-origin requests to the vulnerable server with `withCredentials=true` or via a sandboxed iframe."
