- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of memory location after end of buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write leading to memory corruption
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector, but it mentions that user interaction is required (UI:R). It also mentions local access is needed (AV:L)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need local access and user interaction, which is likely triggered by opening a maliciously crafted file.
