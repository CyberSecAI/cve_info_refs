Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39321:

**1. Verification:**
The content directly relates to CVE-2021-39321, as it describes a PHP Object Injection vulnerability found in the Sassy Social Share plugin. The CVE ID is explicitly mentioned in the Wordfence article and the description matches the vulnerability details provided.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure implementation of the import settings functionality in the Sassy Social Share plugin. Specifically, the `import_config` function utilizes `unserialize()` on user-supplied data without proper sanitization or authorization checks.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **PHP Object Injection:** The core vulnerability is the use of `unserialize()` on untrusted data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious PHP objects into the application's memory.
- **Missing Authorization Controls:** The `import_config` function lacks capability checks and nonce protection, enabling any authenticated user (including subscriber-level users) to trigger the import function.
- **Unsafe Deserialization:** The `unserialize` function is used without first validating that the unserialized object is safe.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  If another plugin or theme with a vulnerable magic method is installed, an attacker can achieve RCE by using a POP chain through the injected PHP objects, enabling actions like creating/deleting files and executing remote commands.
- **Site Takeover:** By achieving RCE, an attacker can fully compromise a vulnerable WordPress site.
- **Settings Manipulation:** Even without RCE, an attacker can import and override the plugin's settings.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is reachable via the network, using the `wp_ajax_heateor_sss_import_config` AJAX action.
- **Malicious Payload:** The attacker crafts a special payload containing malicious PHP objects, which is then base64 encoded and sent as the `config` parameter in a POST request.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site. This can be a low-privileged subscriber if the site has open registration, making the vulnerability easily exploitable.
- **Understanding of PHP Object Injection:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of how PHP object injection works and be able to craft a malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided `plugins.trac.wordpress.org` content shows the code changes made to address this vulnerability in version 3.3.24. This shows that the vulnerability was fixed by adding authorization and nonce checks to the `import_config` function, and replacing `unserialize` with `json_decode` which removes the ability to perform Object Injection.
- The Wordfence article also indicates that both free and premium Wordfence users were protected from this vulnerability due to an existing firewall rule.
