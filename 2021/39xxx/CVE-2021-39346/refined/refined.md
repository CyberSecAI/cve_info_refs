Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39346:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

   - The provided text includes a section for "Google Maps Easy <= 1.9.33 Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting" with a matching CVE ID: [CVE-2021-39346](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-39346) This confirms that the content relates to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

   - **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation and sanitization of user-supplied data in the `~/modules/marker_groups/views/tpl/mgrEditMarkerGroup.php` file.

   - **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
     - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):  The plugin allows administrative users to inject malicious web scripts through input fields related to marker groups. This is due to a lack of sanitization of user supplied data and a failure to escape data on output.

   - **Impact of Exploitation:**
     - Successful exploitation allows an attacker with administrative access to inject malicious JavaScript into the plugin settings, which will then execute whenever a user accesses an affected page on the website (i.e., on plugin settings pages, specifically related to marker groups), potentially compromising the website user.

   - **Attack Vectors:**
     - The attacker leverages the administrative interface within the "Google Maps Easy" plugin.
     -  Specifically, vulnerable input fields are located in `~/modules/marker_groups/views/tpl/mgrEditMarkerGroup.php` file.

   - **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     - The attacker needs to be an administrative user of the WordPress site or compromise an existing administrator account.
     - The attacker must be able to access the settings pages for the "Google Maps Easy" plugin.
     - The affected settings are within the marker group configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content references a patch in version 1.10.1 of the Google Maps Easy plugin.
*   The vulnerability is relevant to multi-site WordPress installations or installations where unfiltered\_html is disabled for administrators, which affects how the XSS payload is stored.
* The content from the WordPress.org Trac changeset viewer and the Wordfence advisory confirm this vulnerability. The Trac changeset details the specific code changes made to sanitize inputs using `htmlGmp::wpKsesHtml` rather than `htmlGmp::text`. The Thinkland Security Team was credited with discovering the vulnerability, which aligns with the information in the Github content.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-39346 is a Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the "Google Maps Easy" WordPress plugin that stems from inadequate sanitization and output escaping of user-supplied data. An attacker with administrative privileges can inject malicious JavaScript via the plugin's settings. This vulnerability specifically affects installations that have unfiltered\_html disabled for administrators.
