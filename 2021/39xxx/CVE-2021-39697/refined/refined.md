Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39697:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an inconsistency in how permission levels are handled within the DownloadProvider component. Specifically, a legacy app with the `WRITE` permission could write to other apps' private app directories.

The issue is rooted in the fact that legacy apps were granted `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission which was being improperly used to allow writing to other app's private directories. This is inconsistent with the expected behavior that such writes should be limited. Furthermore, the value of permission might be inconsistent between BasePermission.perm.protection-Level and BasePermission.getProtectionLevel() within the same object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inconsistent Permission Handling:**  The core issue is the inconsistency in permission level application, where apps are granted permissions they shouldn't have access to.
*   **Incorrect Access Control:** Legacy apps with `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission could bypass intended access restrictions.
*   **Private Data Exposure:** The vulnerability could allow one app to write and potentially overwrite files in another app's private directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Corruption/Modification:** An attacker could modify or corrupt data within another app's private directory.
*  **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Though not explicitly stated it could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to further an attack.
*   **Privacy violation:** Sensitive data in the private directories of apps can be potentially compromised.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Legacy Application:** An attacker could create a malicious legacy app targeting the vulnerability.
*   **Existing Legacy App Compromise:** An attacker could compromise an existing legacy app already installed on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **App Installation:** The attacker needs to be able to install or control a legacy application on the targeted device.
*   **WRITE Permission:** The attacker's app would need the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability involves updating the permissions to ensure consistency and restrict writes to private app directories, unless it's the app's own directories.
*   The fix includes mocking the context for permission less apps, and declaring permissions in manifest to get permissions or app-ops for Android S and above. This test failed on Android R, as even though the test app didn't declare the permissions it got the permissions granted.
*   Legacy apps can still write to other apps' Android/media package directories, however this is stated to not be possible for non-legacy apps.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-39697 allows a legacy app with the `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE` permission to write to other apps' private directories, due to inconsistent handling of permission levels. This could allow for data corruption and potential privilege escalation if combined with other vulnerabilities. The fix addresses this by ensuring permission levels are enforced correctly.
