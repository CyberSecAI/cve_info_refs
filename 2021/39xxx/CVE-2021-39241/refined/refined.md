  {
    "CVE": "CVE-2021-39241",
    "vulnerability_details": [
      {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by HAProxy's handling of the ':method' field in HTTP/2 requests. HAProxy allows spaces within the ':method' field, which can lead to the construction of an invalid HTTP/1 request on the backend side.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper input validation of the HTTP method field in HTTP/2 requests.",
          "Failure to properly sanitize or normalize the method field before forwarding to HTTP/1 backends."
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can potentially cause a misinterpretation of the request by a lenient HTTP/1 backend server, leading to request routing to an incorrect server and circumventing security measures.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Sending a crafted HTTP/2 request with a space in the ':method' field."
        ],
         "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to send a specially crafted HTTP/2 request to the HAProxy server."
      }
    ],
     "affected_versions": [
        "versions 2.0 prior to 2.0.24",
        "versions 2.2 prior to 2.2.16",
        "versions 2.3 prior to 2.3.13",
        "versions 2.4 prior to 2.4.3",
        "versions 2.5 prior to 2.5-dev4"
    ],
    "remediation": [
      "Reject invalid characters in the method by placing a filtering rule on the request path: `http-request reject if { method -m reg [^A-Z0-9] }`",
      "Disable the HTX internal representation in the affected backends and frontends (version 2.0 only): `no option http-use-htx`",
    "Upgrade to patched versions of HAProxy."
      ]
