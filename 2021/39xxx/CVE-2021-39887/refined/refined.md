{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the use of unsanitized atwho template variables within GitLab's GFM auto-complete feature. The `jquery.atwho` library's template interpolation is exploited due to the inclusion of attacker-controlled data (issue titles) in the `displayTpl` function without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
    "Unsanitized template variables in `jquery.atwho`",
    "Inadequate sanitization of user-supplied data (issue titles) used in the auto-complete feature",
    "Use of JavaScript string interpolation instead of atwho's template interpolation."
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim user's browser when the user uses the auto-complete feature. This can be used for account takeover by stealing cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information. Attackers could create malicious issues or merge requests, and when other users type `#` in an input field with GFM auto-complete, they become vulnerable.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker crafts a malicious issue title that contains an XSS payload using the `$\{search}` syntax. When a user types `#` in a field with GFM auto-complete, the malicious issue title is displayed in the auto-complete suggestions, and the JavaScript payload executes.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to create issues or merge requests (or other items that support auto-complete). They must be able to craft a malicious title containing the XSS payload. No special user privileges are required beyond the ability to create these items on a project."
