Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-39240:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from how HAProxy handles the `:scheme` and `:path` fields in HTTP/2 requests. By injecting specific characters/strings into these fields, an attacker can manipulate the final URI constructed by HAProxy, potentially causing a mismatch between the authority used for routing and the actual URI seen by the backend server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper URI Construction:** HAProxy concatenates `:scheme`, `:authority`, and `:path` to construct a full URI. However, it sets the `Host` header before this concatenation, creating a potential mismatch.
*   **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The `:scheme` and `:path` fields are not properly validated or sanitized, allowing malicious strings to be inserted. This leads to the generation of incorrect URIs and the potential for routing bypass.
*   **Inconsistent Handling of HTTP/2 headers:** The processing of the `:scheme`, `:authority` and `:path` headers can lead to inconsistent values being used by HAProxy and the backend server

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Routing Bypass:** An attacker can potentially bypass routing rules based on the `Host` header or URI, causing requests to be routed to unintended backend servers. This can lead to unauthorized access to resources or other malicious activities.
*   **HTTP Request Smuggling:** Though not a direct smuggling attack in the traditional sense, the ability to manipulate the URI can potentially lead to unexpected behavior and security risks if backend servers are not robust.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP/2 Requests:** An attacker must send a specially crafted HTTP/2 request with malicious values in the `:scheme` and/or `:path` fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP/2 requests to the HAProxy server.
*   The attacker does not need to be on the local network

**Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability primarily affects HAProxy versions 2.2 and above when communicating with HTTP/2 backend servers. HTTP/1 backends are not directly affected by this specific issue, as H2 requests are converted to HTTP/1 origin-form requests.
*   The vulnerability occurs during the process of reconstructing the URI from HTTP/2 headers.

**Specific Example:**

As mentioned in the provided text, this type of request can be used to make HAProxy and the backend see different URIs.

```
H2 request
 :method:   "GET"
 :scheme:   "<http://localhost/?orig=">;
 :authority "example.org"
 :path:     "/"
```
In this case HAProxy would create the `Host` header with `example.org` and the reconstructed URI would be `<http://localhost/?orig=example.org/>`

**Mitigation:**

The provided content suggests the following mitigations:

*   **Upgrade:** Upgrade to a patched version of HAProxy (2.2.16, 2.3.13, 2.4.3, 2.5-dev4 or later)
*   **URI Rewriting:** Use the `http-request set-uri %[url]` directive in the frontend to force a re-synchronization between the `Host` header and the URI after recomposition.
*   **Disable HTTP/2**: If HTTP/2 is not strictly required for backend servers, disabling it with `no option http-use-htx` or by removing  `proto h2` from the server lines can be a valid workaround.
