Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause lies in the lack of proper input validation when creating or editing OAuth applications within GitLab. Specifically, the `scopes` parameter, which defines the permissions an application requests, is not sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary text into the scope descriptions displayed during the OAuth authorization process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the absence of validation or sanitization of the `scopes` parameter.
*   **Text Injection:**  An attacker can inject arbitrary text into the scope descriptions by providing crafted scope values, leveraging special characters like ALT+255 to bypass space separation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Phishing:** An attacker can use the text injection vulnerability to create misleading scope descriptions that trick users into authorizing malicious applications.
*   **Token Theft:** The attacker can obtain the user's GitLab API token if the user clicks "Authorize" on the manipulated OAuth authorization page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Application Creation/Modification:** The attacker creates or edits an OAuth application using a POST request. This request includes manipulated scopes with text injected using URL encoded characters for spaces (`%C2%A0`).
*   **OAuth Authorization Flow:** The attacker then uses the crafted application and initiates the OAuth authorization flow, which will display the injected text to the victim user.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires the user to interact with the OAuth authorization screen and click "Authorize".

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GitLab Account:** The attacker needs an account on GitLab to create OAuth applications.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the GitLab server.
*   **User Lure:** The attacker needs to entice the victim into clicking the crafted OAuth link to authorize the malicious application
