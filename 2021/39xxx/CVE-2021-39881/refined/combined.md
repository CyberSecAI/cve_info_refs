# Ability to add your scopes to the app + text injection in OAuth

**[HackerOne report #494530](https://hackerone.com/reports/494530)** by `executor` on 2019-02-11, assigned to `dappelt`:

Hello again! Found that in applications (<https://gitlab.com/profile/applications>) the scope that we pass in the request when creating and editing the application is not checked. It turns out that we can pass your scope, with its text. I decided to try it and I did it!

[![Screenshot_1.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/193b77c420adef28a7a73d8fb377d9c9ef6311c0/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3439343533302f3432323038332f53637265656e73686f745f312e706e67)

But it didn't give any strong result..

Then I got the idea, and what if the scope to write the text that it was displayed OAuth authorization

The first problem I encountered was a problem. Any space between the two words shared a single scope on several scopes.

The solution to this problem came almost immediately, I decided to try to replace the space with another space (alt+255 on numpad keyboard)

[![Screenshot_2.png](data:image/gif;base64...)](https://user-content.gitlab-static.net/e2a76b04cdca252a132f1731cc47b26b6e920288/68747470733a2f2f68312e7365632e6769746c61622e6e65742f612f3439343533302f3432323038382f53637265656e73686f745f322e706e67)

```

Then I decided to check all this on OAuth authorization

Everything works fine, as seen in the screenshot.

Proof of Concept

ATTENTION: This PoC is a real app that will get your GitLab API token if you click Authorize. If you open it, either close the window or click Deny.

## Impact

Inattentive user can read only the bottom lines and lead to phishing. As a result, we will have a victim token.
