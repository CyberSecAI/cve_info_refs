Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39213:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to bypass IP restrictions on the GLPI API by injecting custom headers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Bypassable IP Restriction:** The core issue is that the IP restrictions implemented for the GLPI API can be circumvented through custom header injection. This indicates a flaw in how the application validates the source IP address of incoming requests, potentially trusting headers that can be manipulated by the attacker.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  **Unauthorized API Access**: By bypassing IP restrictions, an attacker can gain unauthorized access to the GLPI API.
-  **Potentially Significant Impact:** Since the API is meant for specific use cases and is restricted for security, this bypass could enable an attacker to perform actions they are not authorized to do, which could lead to data breaches, system compromise or other malicious activities. The impact can vary based on which API endpoints are exposed and accessible using this vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Custom Header Injection:** An attacker can inject custom headers into an HTTP request that the GLPI API processes.
-  **Network Access:**  The attacker requires network access to the GLPI server where the API is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Network Access**: The attacker must have network connectivity to the GLPI server.
-  **Understanding of HTTP Headers:** The attacker must be able to craft HTTP requests with custom headers to exploit the vulnerability.
-  **No Authentication Needed:** The description indicates the attack bypasses the IP restriction, and no authentication is needed to perform the bypass itself. However, further API access will require proper authorization/authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in GLPI versions 9.1 and later.
-  The fix is included in GLPI version 9.5.6.
-  A workaround is to disable the API Rest feature.
- The severity is rated as "Moderate".
- The description notes "No CWEs", indicating that the vulnerability does not clearly fit into existing classifications.
