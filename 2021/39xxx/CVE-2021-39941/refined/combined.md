**[HackerOne report #706361](https://hackerone.com/reports/706361)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-10-02, assigned to [@cmaxim](/cmaxim "Costel Maxim"):

### Summary

Hello,

The default branch should not be visible to guest/non-member users when they do not have any access to repository. However, default branch is still visible to such users.

I am reporting this issue as similar report was resolved before #531694 which exposes default branch when there was no access to repository.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a public project with non access to repository for non members. This can be done by setting repository as `Only Project Members`.
2. This should ensure that no information related to repository is visible to non members
3. Now , as a non member, just visit to project details pages `https://gitlab.com/<UserName>/<ProjectName>` and do the inspect element of browser.
4. In `Body` html tag, you should see `data-find-file` attribute which exposes default branch. Note that default branch can be set to anything by admins.

### Examples

You can see my project here at `https://gitlab.com/gitlabadminuser/thisispublicproject` and follow the above steps to know default branch from this project.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Default branch is visible to non members when they do not have any access to repository

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

None of the repository related information should be visible to non members when they do not have access

### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com and might be on omnibus installations too.

Regards,

Ashish

## Impact

This bug exposes default branch to

1. Non members in public project when repository is `only project members`
2. Guest in private project can see when they do not have any access to repository
3. No badges setup in projects/groups
4. Public pipelines are disabled
