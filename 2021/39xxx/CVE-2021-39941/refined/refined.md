Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the exposure of the default branch name within the HTML source code of a GitLab project page, even when a user lacks permissions to access the repository. This occurs because the `data-find-file` attribute in the HTML includes the default branch name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the disclosure of the default branch name.
*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The system fails to properly restrict access to repository-related information based on user permissions. It exposes the default branch information to non-members even when repository access is restricted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Leakage:** An attacker can discover the default branch name of a project, even if they are not a member or do not have repository access. This information could potentially be used in further reconnaissance or targeted attacks.
*   **Circumvention of Access Restrictions:** While the attacker can't access the repository content, knowing the default branch name could be considered a circumvention of the intended access restrictions.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Web Request:** An attacker can access a project's page (`https://gitlab.com/<UserName>/<ProjectName>`) as a non-member, then examine the HTML source code of the page to find the default branch name in the `data-find-file` attribute.
*   **API requests:** Potentially similar information disclosure could happen through API requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a non-member of the project or a guest user with no repository access.
*   **Basic Web Browser Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to view the HTML source of a webpage.

**Additional Notes:**
* The issue was initially reported in HackerOne report #706361 on 2019-10-02.
* The vulnerability is present in public projects where the repository is set to "Only Project Members" as well as in private projects where guests have no repository access.
* The report mentions that a similar report was resolved before #531694.
* The vulnerability is reported to be present on GitLab.com and possibly on omnibus installations.
* The report was updated on October 25, 2021.
