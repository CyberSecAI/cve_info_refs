**Root cause of vulnerability:** The Hashthemes Demo Importer plugin failed to perform capability checks for AJAX actions, relying only on a nonce check, which was insufficient as the nonce was visible to all users, including low-privileged ones.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Improper Access Control: The plugin did not properly restrict access to sensitive AJAX actions.
*   Inadequate nonce check: The AJAX nonce was exposed to low-privileged users, rendering the nonce check ineffective as a security measure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Complete site reset: Any logged-in user could trigger the `hdi_install_demo` AJAX function with a `reset` parameter set to `true`, leading to the plugin's `database_reset` function being executed.
*   Database wipe: The `database_reset` function would truncate all database tables except for `wp_options`, `wp_users`, and `wp_usermeta`.
*   Media deletion: After wiping the database, the `clear_uploads` function would delete all files and folders in `wp-content/uploads`, resulting in the loss of all uploaded media.
*   Complete loss of site content: The exploitation of the vulnerability leads to the permanent loss of nearly all website data and media.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network: The attack is performed over the network using HTTP requests.
*   AJAX: The vulnerability is exploited by calling specific AJAX actions within the plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Authenticated user: Any logged-in user, even low-privileged users such as subscribers, can exploit the vulnerability. The user needs to be logged into the WordPress instance.
*   Knowledge of the vulnerable AJAX action: An attacker needs to be aware of the `hdi_install_demo` AJAX function and the `reset` parameter.

**Additional details:**
* The vulnerability was present in versions 1.1.1 and earlier of the Hashthemes Demo Importer plugin.
* The patched version 1.1.2 addresses the vulnerability.
* A CVSS score of 8.1 (High) was assigned.
* Wordfence Premium users received a firewall rule protecting against this vulnerability on August 25, 2021, and free Wordfence users received it on September 24, 2021.
