**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to an unauthorized rewriting issue within the memory access management module on the ACPU (Application Central Processing Unit).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthorized Memory Rewriting:** The core issue is that the memory access management module on the ACPU allows for unauthorized modification of memory. This implies a flaw in how memory access permissions are enforced or checked.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may lead to a compromise of service confidentiality. This means sensitive information could be accessed or exposed due to the unauthorized memory rewriting.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is within the memory access management module on the ACPU. Specific details on how an attacker could trigger this vulnerability are not provided in the document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to interact with or manipulate the vulnerable memory access management module on the ACPU.
*   The document implies that the attacker does not need to be a privileged user as the attack leads to unauthorized operations.

**Affected Versions:**

*   EMUI 12.0.0

**Summary**

The CVE-2021-39991 describes a high-severity vulnerability in Huawei's EMUI 12.0.0, specifically in the memory access management module of the ACPU. This vulnerability allows an attacker to rewrite memory without proper authorization, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
