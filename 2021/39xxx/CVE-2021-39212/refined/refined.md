Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-39212:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from missing policy checks in the `RegisterStaticModules` function of ImageMagick. Specifically, when a module policy was set to "none" for a specific pattern (e.g., "PS" for PostScript files), the check was not correctly enforced during the module registration. This allowed the module to be registered and used, bypassing the intended security policy.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Policy Bypass: The core issue is a bypass of the intended module policy restrictions.
- Inconsistent Policy Enforcement:  The `module` policy was not being consistently applied during module registration.
- Incorrect Rights Checks: The `RegisterStaticModule` function did not use the correct rights during policy checks, and this was corrected in commit `01faddb`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access and processing of PostScript files (or other file types targeted by module policies).
- Potential for attackers to leverage this vulnerability to execute malicious code by including it in the PostScript file.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to supply a PostScript file (or other file types targeted by module policies) to ImageMagick to trigger the vulnerability.
- This could occur via various means such as user-uploaded files or through processing of image formats that contain embedded PostScript data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to submit a PostScript file to be processed by ImageMagick. This could be a user of a service, a web application with image processing functionality, or any system utilizing ImageMagick for image manipulation.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in ImageMagick versions 7.1.0-7 and 6.9.12-22
- A workaround was suggested by using the `coder` policy with the pattern `{PS,EPI,EPS,EPSF,EPSI}`.
- Commit `35893e7` added missing policy checks in `RegisterStaticModules`
- Commit `01faddb` corrected the rights that were being checked in `RegisterStaticModule`.
