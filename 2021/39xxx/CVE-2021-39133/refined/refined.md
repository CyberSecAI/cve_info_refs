Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39133:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery) protection in the plugin upload/install endpoints of Rundeck.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing CSRF protection: The plugin upload and install endpoints did not validate the request origin, which allows an attacker to forge requests on behalf of an authenticated user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can potentially run untrusted code on the Rundeck server by exploiting the CSRF vulnerability to install a malicious plugin.

**Attack vectors:**
- CSRF attack: An attacker can trick an authenticated user into submitting a forged request to the vulnerable plugin upload/install endpoints, which could lead to arbitrary code execution on the Rundeck server by uploading and installing a malicious plugin.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Target User with admin access: An attacker needs to target a Rundeck user who has 'admin' access to the 'system' resource type, as plugin upload/install functionality is restricted to such roles.
- Social Engineering: The attacker would likely need to use social engineering techniques to trick the user into visiting a malicious page that triggers the forged request.

**Additional details:**
- The fix implemented in the provided commit introduces CSRF protection by validating the ajax form token before proceeding with plugin upload/install requests.
- The vulnerability is present in Rundeck versions before 3.4.3 and 3.3.14, with the fixes released in these versions respectively.
- The advisory also mentions that specific workarounds might be available on the Rundeck security page.
