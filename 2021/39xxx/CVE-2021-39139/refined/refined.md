Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-39139:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly references `CVE-2021-39139` and describes a vulnerability related to arbitrary code execution in XStream due to manipulation of the processed input stream with type information, which aligns with the official CVE description.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The root cause lies in XStream's deserialization process. When unmarshalling data, XStream uses type information present in the input stream to recreate objects. This mechanism is exploited when the attacker manipulates this type information to inject malicious objects. This allows execution of arbitrary code. XStream used a blacklist approach by default to block known critical classes of the Java runtime. This approach is proven to be unsafe and has been replaced with a whitelist.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Unsafe Deserialization**: The core vulnerability lies in XStream's insecure deserialization process, which allows for the injection of malicious objects.
    *   **Type Information Manipulation:** Attackers can manipulate the type information within the serialized data to point to malicious classes or object creation chains.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system with the privileges of the process running XStream.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Manipulated Input Stream:** The attack vector involves manipulating the serialized input stream, which contains type information used during deserialization by XStream. This can be XML, JSON or any supported data format.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Ability to Manipulate Input Stream:** An attacker needs to have the ability to modify the serialized data that is to be processed by XStream.
    *   **No User Interaction**: The exploitation is possible without any user interaction on the target system.
    *   **Remote Attack:** A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability through a manipulated input stream.

**3. Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is present in all XStream versions up to and including 1.4.17.
*   The vulnerability can be avoided by using XStream's security framework with a whitelist. XStream now defaults to using a whitelist, but a blacklist should be avoided.
*   The provided example in the `x-stream.github.io` content uses a `LinkedHashSet` and `TemplatesImpl` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
*   The provided `x-stream.github.io` content mentions the vulnerability can be performed on any supported format, such as JSON.

**4. Summary**

CVE-2021-39139 is a critical vulnerability in XStream that allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code by manipulating the type information within a serialized data stream which is then deserialized by XStream. This is due to a insecure deserialization. This vulnerability affects all XStream versions up to 1.4.17, but can be avoided by using a whitelist, which is now enabled by default.

**5. Note**
Some of the content mentions related CVEs. These are related to vulnerabilities caused by insecure deserialization, but are distinct from CVE-2021-39139.
