The provided content is related to CVE-2021-39373.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Samsung Drive Manager software stores the user password in plain text within the source code, which is exposed during the password conversion process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Plaintext storage of passwords.
- Incorrect handling of password conversion, specifically with `WideCharToMultiByte` function, exposing the password in memory.
- Improper access control due to leaked credentials.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain administrator privileges on the secure disk without additional information.
- The attacker can steal user credentials by accessing the exposed password.
- The attacker can access and steal confidential data stored on the secure disk without needing the decryption key.
- The attacker can delete or add disks using the disk management function after obtaining administrative privilege.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required to run the vulnerable software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs local access to a system where the Samsung Drive Manager software is installed.
- The attacker must be able to analyze the memory or process to retrieve the exposed password.
- No user interaction is required for exploitation.
