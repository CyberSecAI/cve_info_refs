Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39163:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Synapse, a Matrix homeserver, handles access control when displaying rooms within groups/communities. Specifically, the server was not correctly verifying if a user had permission to view metadata of a private room before including it in the list of rooms within a group.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper checks to ensure that only authorized users can access private room metadata.
- **Exposure of Private Data via Group Features:** Group/community functionality was not properly isolated from private room permissions, causing information disclosure.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An unauthorized user could discover a private room's:
    - Name
    - Avatar
    - Topic
    - Number of members

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker must know the Room ID of the private room.
- The attacker and a member of the private room must be on the same homeserver.
- The attacker's homeserver must have `enable_group_creation` enabled, allowing non-admin users to create groups/communities.
- The attacker creates a group and attempts to enumerate associated rooms.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user on a vulnerable Matrix homeserver.
- The attacker needs the ability to create groups/communities on the target homeserver (configuration dependent).
- The attacker needs to know the room ID of the private room.

**Additional details:**
The vulnerability was fixed in Synapse version 1.41.1 and later. The fix involved adding checks to `synapse/groups/groups_server.py` to ensure the user is authorized to see room metadata before sending it to the user. Additionally, tests were updated to verify that unauthorized users could not view information about private rooms.
