Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2021-39274:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The installation script for Sn1per v9.0 sets insecure directory permissions (0777) on the installation directory `/usr/share/sniper/`. Specifically, lines 37-40 of the `install.sh` script are responsible for this:
```
mkdir -p $INSTALL_DIR 2> /dev/null
chmod 777 -Rf $INSTALL_DIR 2> /dev/null
chown root $INSTALL_DIR/sniper 2> /dev/null
chmod 4777 $INSTALL_DIR/sniper 2> /dev/null
```

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Insecure directory permissions: The `chmod 777` command grants read, write, and execute permissions to all users on the installation directory and all its subdirectories and files.
- This allows any unprivileged user to modify the application's files, including executable scripts and configuration files.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- Arbitrary code execution with root privileges: By modifying executable files or the `sniper.conf` configuration file (which is sourced by bash), an attacker can inject malicious code that will be executed with root privileges when the application is run by a privileged user, as the application requires root privileges to run, and this is verified using `EUID` check.

**Attack vectors:**

- An attacker with local access to the system can leverage the insecure directory permissions to modify the application files.
- Specifically, they can insert malicious code into the `sniper` executable, or the `sniper.conf` configuration file
- Modification of the `sniper.conf` would be more stealthy as the configuration file is sourced directly via `source` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have local access to the system where Sn1per is installed.
- No elevated privileges are needed initially, as the vulnerability is exploited by writing to files within the application's installation directory, which is made world-writable by the vulnerable installation process.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was tested on Ubuntu 21.04.
- The provided content also discusses CVE-2021-39273, which is a separate but related vulnerability.

The content provides more technical details than the CVE description, specifically, it details the vulnerable lines in the install script, the location of the vulnerable directory, and methods of exploitation.
