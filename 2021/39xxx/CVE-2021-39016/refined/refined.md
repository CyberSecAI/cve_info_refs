- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application can be induced to perform server-side HTTP and HTTPS requests to arbitrary domains.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: External Service Interaction, specifically Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can potentially make the server perform requests to internal services or external servers that the attacker normally cannot access directly, potentially leading to information disclosure, internal service exploitation, or denial-of-service.
- **Attack vectors**: By manipulating the application to make requests to arbitrary domains
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to interact with the IBM Engineering Lifecycle Optimization - Publishing application in a way that can manipulate the destination of the HTTP/HTTPS requests.
