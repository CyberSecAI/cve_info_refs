  "CVE-2021-39888": {
    "description": "GitLab discloses additional information about a project with the `Only Project Members` visibility. For a public project that provided access to only project members, GitLab discloses issues/merge request templates and a name of the private group shared with the project through the Project API.",
    "root_cause": "The Project API improperly discloses information about projects with `Only Project Members` visibility to users with read permissions.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "The `shared_with_groups` field discloses the ID and full path of private groups associated with the project. The `issues_template` and `merge_requests_template` fields disclose the content of templates, potentially containing sensitive information, internal links, or links to project uploads. An attacker with read access can potentially use this information to gain further access to resources.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "API request",
      "Project API"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
        "Read access to a project with `Only Project Members` visibility"
    ],
        "details": "The vulnerability occurs when a user with read permission in a project with the `Only Project Members` visibility can access the values of `shared_with_groups`, `issues_template`, and `merge_requests_template` through the Project API. The expected behavior is that these values should not be accessible to users with read permission in such projects. The issue is that the API does not enforce the visibility restriction and returns this data."
