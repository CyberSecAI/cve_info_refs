Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39707:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies within the `AppRestrictionsFragment` in the Android Settings application. The issue stems from a bypass of the `CALL_PRIVILEGED` permission.  Specifically, the `onReceive` method of `AppRestrictionsFragment` could be exploited to initiate a phone call without proper permission checks due to a confused deputy issue and how the `restrictionsIntent` is being used.  The `restrictionsIntent` could potentially resolve to multiple activities, which is not checked, and then the activity is started without verifying it belongs to the Settings app. This could allow a malicious app to trick the Settings app into calling a privileged activity.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Intent Handling:** The `AppRestrictionsFragment`'s handling of `restrictionsIntent` lacked sufficient validation. It did not verify the target activity before starting it.
*   **Confused Deputy Problem:** The fragment acts on behalf of another application and is tricked into performing actions it shouldn't because it does not validate it is only using a safe intent.
*   **Missing Permission Checks:** The code failed to properly enforce permission requirements for starting the privileged call activity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation (EoP):** A malicious application could exploit this vulnerability to escalate its privileges, gaining the ability to make phone calls, which could be used to perform malicious activities, including but not limited to denial of service or eavesdropping on calls. The attacker does not need system execution privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Application:** A malicious app installed on the device could trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Intent Manipulation:** The malicious app would construct a specific intent that bypasses the intended security restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Installed Application:** The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target device.
*   **User Interaction:** It might not require user interaction, depending on how the exploit is crafted.

**Additional Notes**

*   The provided code change fixes this vulnerability by checking if the resolved activity's package name matches the current package name.
*   The fix ensures that `AppRestrictionsFragment` calls `resolveActivity` and then verifies the resulting activity's package name before starting the activity and thus prevents the confused deputy attack.
* The commit message mentions manual testing steps involving installing certificates via Settings and verifying that a test app cannot reset them, but Settings can. It also checks that `com.android.credentials.INSTALL` is not changed.
