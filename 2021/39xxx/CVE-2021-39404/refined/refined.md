Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to potential vulnerabilities:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is caused by insufficient input sanitization when adding new products via the MaianAffiliate admin panel. Specifically, it allows for the injection of malicious code or scripts within the product data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The injected payload is stored in the database and then reflected on the affiliate main page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious client-side scripts (e.g., JavaScript) which will be executed in the browsers of users visiting the affected page.
*   **Code Execution (potentially):** It is stated that this is "Code execution and stored XSS". Although the specific code execution vector is not detailed, it can be inferred that it may involve using the XSS to perform client side code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **XSS:** The XSS vulnerability enables an attacker to perform malicious actions on the user's browser. This can include stealing cookies, redirecting the user to malicious websites, performing actions on the behalf of the user, etc.
*   **Code Execution:** Although less detailed, the potential for code execution would be more severe. An attacker may be able to execute commands on the server, which may include creating new admin accounts, data breaches, server takeover etc.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves an authenticated attacker logging into the MaianAffiliate admin panel.
*   The attacker would need to inject their malicious code while adding a new product (or potentially modify an existing one), specifically within fields that are later displayed on the affiliate main page.
*   The attack will be triggered when a user (authenticated or unauthenticated) views the affiliate main page, which reflects the stored XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must have valid credentials to access the MaianAffiliate admin panel.
*   The attacker must have the ability to add or modify product data.

**Additional details:**
*   The payload is reflected on the affiliate main page for all visitors (both authenticated and unauthenticated), meaning an attack is not limited to other admin accounts
* The repository provides a GIF demonstrating how the XSS vulnerability occurs

It's important to note that this is a summary based on the provided content. For a complete and accurate assessment of the vulnerability, access to the MaianAffiliate application and source code is required.
