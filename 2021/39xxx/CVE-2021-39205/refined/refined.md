Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-39205

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper escaping of properties within JSON objects. This lack of escaping allows for the injection of malicious properties, leading to prototype pollution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- Content Spoofing via Prototype Pollution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to client-side XSS, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could result in various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, data theft, or defacement.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves injecting malicious properties into JSON objects. This suggests that the vulnerability is triggered when the application processes user-controlled JSON data without properly sanitizing or escaping it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs the ability to inject malicious properties into JSON objects that the Jitsi Meet application processes.  The specific attack details (e.g. which input/api to inject into) are not included in the provided documents. It is also not clear if the attacker needs to be in a privileged position (e.g.  a participant in a meeting) or if the vulnerability is exposed to the internet without any form of authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as "low" severity.
- The vulnerability was fixed in jitsi-meet version 2.0.6173 and later.
- The fix was implemented in pull requests #9320 and #9404.
- It was reported through the 8x8 HackerOne vulnerability disclosure program.
- The provided content provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description.
- The provided documents do not provide any exploit code.
