Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-39375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL Injection flaw present in the `getDimensionItemsByCode` function of the Philips Tasy EMR software.
*   The root cause is improper sanitization of the `filterValue` parameter in the URL: `hostname/TasyAppServer/resources/service/WAdvancedFilter/getDimensionItemsByCode`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The `filterValue` parameter is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization or escaping. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data exfiltration:** Attackers can extract sensitive data from the database, including potentially protected health information (PHI). The provided PoC shows an example where user information and table owners can be accessed.
*   **Potential for further attacks:** Successful SQL injection could lead to complete database compromise and further attacks on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request:** The attacker sends a crafted POST request to the vulnerable URL.
*   **Vulnerable parameter:** The `filterValue` parameter within the POST request is the injection point.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Philips Tasy EMR server.

**Technical Details**

*   **Vulnerable URL:** `hostname/TasyAppServer/resources/service/WAdvancedFilter/getDimensionItemsByCode`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** `filterValue`
*   **Request Method:** POST
*   **Request Type:** JSON
*   **Payload Example:**  `a%' AND (SELECT CTXSYS.DRITHSX.SN(user,(SELECT DISTINCT owner FROM all_tables OFFSET 1 ROWS FETCH NEXT 1 ROWS ONLY)) FROM dual) like '%a`
    *   This payload is designed to extract user and owner information from the database.
