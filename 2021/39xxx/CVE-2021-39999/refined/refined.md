- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of packets received by DOPRA SSP products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Buffer overflow, insufficient input validation
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker sends a specifically crafted message/packet to the target device
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to send network packets to the affected module of the target device.
