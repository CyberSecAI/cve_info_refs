  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from a flaw in access control where users can reply to Vulnerability Report discussions even when the visibility is set to 'Only Project Members', provided they know the discussion ID.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Inconsistent enforcement of visibility settings"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker, not being a project member but in possession of a discussion ID, can comment on Vulnerability Report discussions, potentially leading to unauthorized information disclosure or manipulation.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker needs to obtain the discussion ID of a Vulnerability Report, which can be done by inspecting network requests or remembering previous discussions.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have access to the GitLab instance. The attacker needs to know or obtain a Vulnerability Report's discussion ID, which can be obtained by intercepting network requests when the vulnerability report is viewed and modified. The attacker can then use this ID to post comments to the discussion. The attacker does not need to be a project member."
