Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39903:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks in the GitLab API. Specifically, when a GitLab administrator restricts project visibility options (e.g., internal, private, or public) through the admin panel, these restrictions are not enforced when users attempt to modify the visibility of their projects via the API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

* **Inadequate API Access Control:** The API endpoint for updating project settings does not correctly validate if the requested visibility level is allowed based on the admin-defined restrictions.
* **Bypass of Admin Settings:** Users can bypass the intended limitations imposed by the administrator regarding project visibility levels.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

* **Data Exposure:** If an administrator restricts project visibility to internal or private, a user can use the API to set their project to public, potentially exposing sensitive information to unauthorized users.
* **Violation of Security Policies:** Organizations that rely on GitLab's visibility controls to enforce specific security policies (e.g., for schools, universities, or private companies) can have those policies undermined by this vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

* **API Manipulation:** An attacker (a regular, non-admin user) can exploit this vulnerability by crafting a PUT request to the GitLab API to change the visibility of their project.
* **Direct API Request:** The attacker sends a PUT request to the `/api/v4/projects/<project_id>` endpoint, including a JSON payload with the desired visibility level.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

* **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated GitLab user (e.g., the owner of the project).
* **API Access:** The attacker must have the ability to send API requests to the GitLab instance.
* **Project Ownership:** The user must be the owner of a project to change its visibility settings.

**Additional Notes:**

* This vulnerability affects both projects and groups.
* The vulnerability was tested and confirmed on GitLab versions 13.7 and 13.8.
* The report includes a specific `curl` command demonstrating how to exploit this vulnerability.
