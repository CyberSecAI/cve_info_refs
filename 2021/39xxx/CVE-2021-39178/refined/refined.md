Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39178:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided SVG content when using the default image optimization loader in Next.js. Specifically, the image optimization API in Next.js versions between 10.0.0 and 11.1.0 does not properly sanitize SVGs, allowing for potential XSS attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS. The image optimization API processes SVG files without sufficient sanitization, allowing malicious scripts embedded within the SVG to execute in the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through a specially crafted SVG image.
- When a user views a page that uses the vulnerable `next/image` component to render the malicious SVG, the injected JavaScript code can be executed in their browser.
- This could lead to various malicious activities such as:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens
    - Redirecting users to phishing websites
    - Defacing the website
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `next/image` component when used with a vulnerable configuration and the default image loader.
- An attacker needs to control the content of an SVG file hosted on a domain listed in the `images.domains` configuration of the Next.js application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have control over an SVG file and host it on a domain listed in the application's `images.domains` configuration in `next.config.js`.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the Next.js application itself. They only need to influence the content of an external SVG file.
- The target application must be using Next.js versions between 10.0.0 and 11.1.0 with the vulnerable default image loader configuration.
- The target application's `next.config.js` file must have the `images.domains` array assigned.
- If the application uses a custom image loader (`images.loader` is assigned), the application is not vulnerable to this specific issue.

**Additional Notes:**
- Vercel deployments are not affected.
- The vulnerability is resolved in Next.js version 11.1.1.
- The vulnerability is classified as "moderate severity."
