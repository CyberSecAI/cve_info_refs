The provided content describes a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) vulnerability in the `mm-wiki` project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- CSRF vulnerability: The application does not validate the origin of requests, allowing attackers to submit state-changing requests through a different origin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Modification of user information: An attacker can modify a user's profile information, such as phone number.
- User addition: If the logged-in user is an administrator, an attacker can add any user to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page or link that triggers a request to the vulnerable application.
- The victim, while logged into the vulnerable application, visits the malicious page or clicks the link.
- The victim's browser automatically sends the crafted request, including session cookies, to the vulnerable application.
- The application processes the request as if it originated from the legitimate user, executing the attacker's desired actions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious HTML page or link that contains a forged request.
- The attacker needs a logged-in user to visit the malicious page or click the crafted link.
