    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The `@npmcli/arborist` library, which manages the `node_modules` folder hierarchy, did not properly verify if the `node_modules` folder was a real directory before extracting package contents. This allowed an attacker to replace the `node_modules` folder with a symbolic link, causing the library to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on the file system.",

        "UNIX Symbolic Link (Symlink) Following",
        "Arbitrary File Creation",
        "Arbitrary File Overwrite",
        "Arbitrary Code Execution"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker could overwrite files, create new files, and potentially execute arbitrary code on the system by manipulating where packages are extracted.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "A `preinstall` script could replace `node_modules` with a symlink.",
        "An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run `npm install --ignore-scripts` in the root."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to either inject a preinstall script into a project or trick a user into installing a project using `npm install --ignore-scripts` with a crafted git repository where the `node_modules` is a symlink."
