Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from an XML external entity (XXE) injection vulnerability in pywps. The default lxml parser was vulnerable to XXE attacks.
-  The vulnerability was caused by the `lxml` library's default parser settings, which allowed the processing of external entities. This means that when parsing XML, the parser would attempt to resolve and include content from external sources, potentially leading to information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **XXE Injection:** The core weakness is the presence of an XML External Entity injection vulnerability. This allows an attacker to potentially include and process external XML entities, leading to the exposure of sensitive data or other attacks.
- **Insecure default parser:** The default settings of the `lxml` parser were insecure as they didn't prevent the processing of external entities.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **File Disclosure:**  An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to view files on the application server's filesystem by providing a path to the external entity. This means they could read arbitrary files that the server process has access to.
- **Information Disclosure:** The primary impact is the potential disclosure of sensitive information from the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious XML Input:**  The attack vector is through the submission of crafted XML input to pywps, which includes references to external entities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to submit XML:** The attacker needs the ability to send or provide XML documents that will be processed by the vulnerable pywps instance. This implies the attacker should be able to interact with the pywps service via an interface that accepts XML input.
- **No authentication needed:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, as the issue is at the XML parsing level.
- **Network Access:** The attacker would need to have network access to the vulnerable pywps instance.

**Additional Details:**

- The provided content also highlights the resolution. The vulnerability was fixed by configuring the `lxml` default parser to avoid security issues using a new `xml_util.py` module that disables the processing of external entities.
- The vulnerability was also discussed in the context of the OWSLib project, where the initial proposal was to replace `lxml` with `defusedxml`, which was later abandoned in favor of configuring the parser.
- The fix was backported to older versions of pywps, such as the version in Debian 9 (stretch).
