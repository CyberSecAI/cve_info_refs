# Overview

This PR configures the lxml default parser to avoid security issues.

For example the default `lxml` parser replaces entities in the XML request with the content of local system files.

* <https://lxml.de/parsing.html#parser-options>
* <https://pypi.org/project/defusedxml/#python-xml-libraries>

Changes:

* Added `xml_util.py` with a configured lxml parser for `lxml.etree.fromstring` and `lxml.etree.parse`.
* Added test for `xml_util.py`.
* Adjust to `werkzeug` deprecation warnings:
  + use `werkzeug.Response`
  + use `markupsafe`
* Cleaned up imports.
