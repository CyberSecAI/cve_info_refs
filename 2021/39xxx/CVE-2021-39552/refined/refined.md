Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow that occurs in the `file::WavFile::readFromFile` function at line 160 of `wav_file.cpp`. This is due to an attempt to read data beyond the allocated buffer size.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- **Heap-buffer-overflow:** The core issue is a heap-buffer-overflow, which is a memory corruption vulnerability. This means the program writes data past the end of an allocated memory block in the heap. This is a classic memory safety issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash/Denial of Service:** The immediate impact observed is a crash due to the AddressSanitizer detecting the heap-buffer-overflow.
- **Potential for Remote Code Execution:**  In more complex scenarios, a heap-buffer-overflow can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution, allowing an attacker to control the program. However, the provided context doesn't demonstrate this level of exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious WAV file:** The attack vector is a specially crafted WAV file that triggers the overflow when read by the vulnerable `readFromFile` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to supply input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious WAV file to the `sela` application. This might be done through file input, network transfer, or some other method of providing the malicious file as input.
- **No special privileges needed**:  No special privileges are mentioned. The vulnerability can be triggered with a normal execution of the program, given a maliciously crafted WAV file.

**Technical details:**
- The AddressSanitizer output shows that the overflow occurs when `std::__copy_move` attempts to read a byte at address `0x6160000008d0`, which is outside of the allocated memory region.
- The crash happens while the program is processing the WAV file, specifically when reading it.
- The provided stack trace clearly shows the function calls leading to the overflow, which includes functions from the standard library (`std::vector` and algorithms) and the custom file reading logic within the sela application.
- The provided POC in `heap-overflow-readFromFile-wav_file-160.zip` allows to reproduce the issue.
