**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE Number:** CVE-2021-39851
*   **Vulnerability Category:** NULL Pointer Dereference ([CWE-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html))
*   **Impact:** Application denial-of-service
*   **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Score:** 5.5
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to a NULL pointer dereference. This occurs when the program attempts to access memory via a pointer that does not point to a valid memory location (i.e., it is NULL).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The core weakness is a NULL pointer dereference vulnerability which is a type of coding error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to an application denial-of-service. This means the application becomes unstable or unresponsive and potentially crashes, preventing legitimate users from accessing and using the software.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is local (AV:L). The attacker needs to have local access to the system in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access:** Local access to the vulnerable system is required (AV:L).
*   **Privileges:** No special privileges are needed (PR:N).
*   **User Interaction:** User interaction is required (UI:R) meaning the user needs to open a specially crafted file to trigger the vulnerability

**Summary of CVE-2021-39851:**
The vulnerability is caused by a NULL pointer dereference, which leads to an application denial-of-service. It can be triggered by a user interacting with a specially crafted file, and the attacker needs local access to the system.
