The provided content describes a stack overflow vulnerability in the `pdftools` project. Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack overflow occurs within the `Analyze::AnalyzePages` function due to excessive recursion. The recursion happens when parsing a crafted PDF file that likely contains a deeply nested structure of pages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack overflow due to unbounded recursion within the `Analyze::AnalyzePages` function. The function calls itself recursively at line 621, and the depth of recursion depends on the structure of the input PDF file.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service (DoS) due to a segmentation fault, which causes the application to crash.
- The program crashes with a stack overflow, making it unavailable for legitimate users.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a maliciously crafted PDF file to the `pdftools` application.
- The specific command line used to trigger the crash is: `./src/pdftools -o /dev/null @@`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PDF file to the `pdftools` application. This could be done locally or potentially remotely if the application is accessible over a network.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was reported with AddressSanitizer output, indicating the exact location of the stack overflow in the code.
- The problematic code is located in `src/analyze.cpp` at line 604 (where the strlen is called) and 621 (recursive call).
- A Proof of Concept (POC) file (`stack-overflow-AnalyzePages-analyze-604.zip`) was provided to reproduce the crash.
- A fix has been merged into the repository with commit id `4d70e6ac27e17047ea1bba20f8f644a3afe08f39` and pull request #7.
