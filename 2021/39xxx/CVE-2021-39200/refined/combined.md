Debian Bug     : 994059 994060

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in Wordpress, a web blogging
tool. They allowed remote attackers to perform Cross-Site Scripting
(XSS) attacks or impersonate other users.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 5.0.14+dfsg1-0+deb10u1.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 5.7.3+dfsg1-0+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your wordpress packages.

For the detailed security status of wordpress please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/wordpress>
