{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the gadget USB driver. The `udc_name` pointer is freed in `unregister_gadget()` after being used in `gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store()`. Later the freed `udc_name` pointer is accessed in `gadget_dev_desc_UDC_show()`, causing the use-after-free.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free"
    ],
    "impact": "The use-after-free can lead to memory corruption, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided call trace shows a crash, indicating denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by accessing the UDC name in `gadget_dev_desc_UDC_show()` after the UDC name has been freed. Specifically, the sequence involves calling `gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store()` followed by `unregister_gadget()`, and subsequently calling `gadget_dev_desc_UDC_show()`. This requires a way to trigger these functions sequentially.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to trigger the specific function calls within the kernel driver: first `gadget_dev_desc_UDC_store()`, then `unregister_gadget()`, and finally `gadget_dev_desc_UDC_show()`."
