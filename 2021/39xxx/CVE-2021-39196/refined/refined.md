Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The `CaptureTypeService.findFilter(String url_suffix)` method in the pcapture application returns a `null` filter when an invalid `url_suffix` is provided. This allows authenticated users to bypass intended capture filters and capture all network traffic.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate input validation:** The application fails to validate the `url_suffix` parameter, which results in a null filter being returned.
- **Security bypass:** The use of a null filter effectively bypasses intended access controls by not applying any capture restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized data capture:** An authenticated user, even without specific permissions for unfiltered captures, can capture all network traffic accessible to the application. This exposes potentially sensitive information.
- **Confidentiality breach:** Captured network traffic may contain sensitive data, such as user credentials, private communications, or other confidential information.
- **Scope change:** The vulnerability allows a user to access network data beyond the intended scope of their privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exposed via the application's REST API, accessible over the network.
- **API endpoint:** The attacker sends a request to the API endpoint `/api/capture/{type}` with an invalid `url_suffix`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user of the pcapture application.
- **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the application's API endpoint.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in versions of pcapture prior to v3.12.
- The fix involves throwing an `IllegalArgumentException` if the `url_suffix` does not exist in the database, preventing the return of a null filter.
- The CVSS score is 7.7, indicating a high severity vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID CVE-2021-39196.
- The vulnerability is related to GHSA-3r67-fxpr-p2qx.
