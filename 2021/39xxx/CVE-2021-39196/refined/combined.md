| **Describe the bug** Major security bug in CaptureTypeService.findFilter(String url\_suffix). If the user specifies a non-existent url\_suffix, a null filter will be returned. This is effectively the same as selecting the "all" capture type. Obviously, this is a major security hole.  **To Reproduce** Call the API's /api/capture/{type} with any non-registered url\_suffix.  **Expected behavior** This should cause an error to be returned by the API.  **Screenshots** N/A  **Desktop (please complete the following information):**   * Any   **Smartphone (please complete the following information):**   * Any   **Additional context** It should be noted, that this only affects authenticated users. So an unauthenticated user can't capture packets. But this does let authenticated users capture any type of packet very easily. |

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Fixed major security bug.

```
A user could effectively specify an undefined url and the program would return a null filter rather than throwing an exception and returning an error to the user. This was a really bad bug. I found it when I was adding code to validate the path parameters. That will be coming in the next commit.

## Package

maven

pcapture
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

< v3.12

## Patched versions

v3.12

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability allows an authenticated but unprivileged user to use the REST API to capture and download packets with no capture filter and without adequate permissions.

This is important because the capture filters can effectively limit the scope of information that a user can see in the data captures. If no filter is present, then all data on the local network segment where the program is running can be captured and downloaded.

### Patches

v3.12 fixes this problem.

### Workarounds

There is no workaround, you must upgrade to v3.12 or greater.

### References

N/A

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
