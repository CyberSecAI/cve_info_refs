The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the reNgine application.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, when a user creates a scan engine with a malicious name (containing JavaScript code), the application stores this name and later displays it without sanitization in the scan engine deletion confirmation modal box.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS): The application fails to sanitize user-provided input when creating a scan engine, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets stored in the database. This code is then executed when a user attempts to delete the scan engine, making it a stored XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into the scan engine name. When the confirmation modal is displayed during deletion, the injected JavaScript code will execute within the victim's browser session. This could lead to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement of the web page
    - Other malicious actions that can be performed using JavaScript

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious scan engine name containing JavaScript code.
- The attacker adds the malicious scan engine using the `/scanEngine/` endpoint.
- The victim user attempts to delete the scan engine.
- The application renders the malicious scan engine name without sanitization in the deletion confirmation modal box which triggers the stored XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the reNgine instance.
- The attacker needs to be able to create scan engines through the `/scanEngine/` endpoint.
- The attacker doesn't need any special privileges and can be an authenticated user with the ability to create scan engines.
