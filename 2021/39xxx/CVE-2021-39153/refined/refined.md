Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-39153:

**1. Verification:**

   - The content from github.com, oracle.com, lists.fedoraproject.org and x-stream.github.io directly discusses CVE-2021-39153, which confirms its relevance. All information is consistent across different sources.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The core issue lies in how XStream processes input streams containing type information. XStream recreates objects based on this information, which can be manipulated by a malicious actor. The vulnerability stems from insecure deserialization.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious objects, leading to the execution of arbitrary code loaded from a remote server. The attacker can manipulate the processed input stream (XML/JSON/etc) to inject code.
   - **Insecure Deserialization:** The vulnerability relies on XStream's insecure deserialization of objects from type information within the processed input.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Arbitrary Code Execution:** This is the primary impact, allowing attackers to run code of their choice on the affected system.
   - **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** The ability to manipulate objects may enable the exfiltration of sensitive data.
   - **Modification of Data:** Attackers could modify data due to the possibility of controlling object properties.
   - **Denial of Service (DoS):** Manipulation of the object graph could potentially cause resource exhaustion, leading to a denial of service.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Manipulated Input Stream:** The attack vector is through a maliciously crafted input stream that contains type information that leads to the execution of arbitrary code during deserialization. The stream could be XML, JSON, or any other format that XStream supports.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Ability to Control Input Stream:** The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input stream that XStream is processing. This could be achieved through various means depending on how XStream is used in the target system, such as by crafting a malicious file or by controlling parameters in an API call.
   - **Knowledge of XStream Internal Processing:** Knowledge of type information in the processed input and how XStream handles it is needed to perform the attack.
    -  **Specific Java Runtime or JavaFX installation :** Vulnerability has been observed when using specific java runtime versions (14 to 8) or when javaFX is installed

**Additional Notes**

   - **Blacklisting vs. Whitelisting:** Previous versions of XStream used a blacklist approach, which proved insufficient. XStream now uses a whitelist, which only allows types with explicit converters by default, strengthening its security.
   - **Workarounds:** The x-stream documentation recommends a whitelist limited to the minimal required types as protection from this vulnerability.
   - **Dependency on Java Runtime:** It's noted that the vulnerability only applies when running XStream "out of the box" on Java versions 8 through 14 or with JavaFX installed. Users who implement XStream's security framework using whitelists are not affected.
   - **Third Party Libraries:** Vulnerability exists when using type information of classes of third party libraries.

In summary, CVE-2021-39153 highlights a critical security flaw in XStream due to insecure deserialization, potentially allowing for remote code execution through crafted input data. The provided details from different sources consistently describe this issue and the need to update XStream to version 1.4.18 or higher, and also the need for use of the XStream security framework.
