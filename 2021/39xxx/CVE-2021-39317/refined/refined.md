Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-39317:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stemmed from insecure implementation of a plugin installation feature in the "Access Demo Importer" plugin. Specifically, the `plugin_offline_installer_callback` function lacked proper authorization checks and nonce verification. This allowed any authenticated user, even with minimal permissions, to trigger the function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Authenticated Arbitrary File Upload:** The primary vulnerability was the ability to upload arbitrary ZIP files from external sources using the insecure `plugin_offline_installer_callback` function. This function would extract the contents of the uploaded zip file to the plugins directory, potentially including malicious PHP files.
- **Lack of Authorization Check:** The `plugin_offline_installer_callback` function did not verify if the user had the necessary capabilities to install plugins.
- **Missing Nonce Check:** There was no verification of a nonce, which is intended to prevent CSRF attacks, in the vulnerable function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious ZIP file containing PHP webshells or other malicious code, attackers could achieve remote code execution on the WordPress site. This would allow complete control of the site.
- **Complete Site Takeover:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete site takeover, allowing the attacker to manipulate the website, steal data, or use the site for malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack could be carried out remotely over the internet.
- **AJAX Action:** The vulnerability was exploited through the `wp_ajax_plugin_offline_installer` AJAX action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needed to be an authenticated user on the WordPress site.
- **Subscriber Level Access:** The vulnerability was exploitable by users with minimal permissions, such as subscriber-level accounts. On sites with open registration, any anonymous user could register and exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was initially reported by Wordfence and later independently by Lenon Leite.
- The vulnerable function allowed the installation of plugins from external URLs, which was not properly secured.
- The developer was non-communicative and unresponsive to initial reports, prompting Wordfence to escalate the issue to the WordPress.org plugins team.
- A partially patched version was released which did not include capability checks.
- The vulnerability was fully patched in version 1.0.7 of the plugin.
