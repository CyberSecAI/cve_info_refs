{
  "CVE-2021-39154": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and inject objects, that result in the execution of arbitrary code loaded from a remote server.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
      "Arbitrary Code Execution",
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)",
      "Insecure deserialization"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation could lead to the loading and execution of arbitrary code, data exfiltration from internal resources, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).",
    "Attack vectors": [
       "Manipulating the processed input stream."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to manipulate the processed input stream. In some cases, valid user credentials might be required."
    }
