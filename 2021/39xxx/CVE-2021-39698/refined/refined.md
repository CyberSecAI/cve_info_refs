  "CVE-2021-39698": {
    "description": "The provided text contains several patches related to the Binder kernel driver, with one of them explicitly mentioning CVE-2021-39698. This CVE is related to a security context issue when looking up security IDs via security_cred_getsecid(). The patch addresses this issue by using the 'struct cred' saved at binder_open() to lookup the security ID, instead of relying on the task. This ensures the security context of the binder is used to generate the security id.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability was that the security ID was being looked up using the task context instead of the credential context associated with the binder during binder_open().",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect security context lookup."
    ],
    "impact": "Elevation of privilege.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local exploitation of binder driver functionality.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker must have the ability to interact with the binder driver."
