Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39358:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of deprecated `SoupSessionSync` objects in `gfbgraph` without enabling TLS certificate verification. The `SoupSessionSync` and `SoupSessionAsync` classes in `libsoup`, by default, do not perform TLS certificate verification unless explicitly configured.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing TLS certificate verification: The application doesn't validate the server's TLS certificate, making it vulnerable to man-in-the-middle (MitM) attacks. This is a classic CWE-295 vulnerability.
- Use of deprecated API:  The use of deprecated `SoupSessionSync` and `SoupSessionAsync` classes which have insecure defaults contributes to the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- MitM attacks: An attacker could intercept network traffic between the client application and the server, potentially stealing sensitive data or injecting malicious content. Because TLS certificate verification is missing, the client cannot verify the identity of the server and can be tricked into communicating with a malicious actor posing as the server.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks: An attacker with the ability to intercept network traffic could exploit the lack of certificate verification. This could be achieved by controlling network infrastructure, such as a compromised WiFi access point.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network proximity: The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept or redirect the network traffic between the vulnerable application and the intended server. This would mean being on the same network, controlling a router in the network path, or other similar positions.
- No specific authentication is needed; the vulnerability is in the lack of verification of the server's TLS certificate, not client authentication.
