Hard-coded credentials in firmware of D-Link DSR-500N
=====================================================
Product: D-Link DSR-500N
CVE: not yet assigned
CWE: CWE-259, CWE-798
Risk factor: Critical
Found: 2021-08-06
Researcher: Daniel Nussko
CVSS Base Score
===============
CVSSv3 Overall Score: 9.8 (Critical)
CVSSv3 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
Description
===========
In D-Link product DSR-500N there are hard-coded credentials for an undocumented user account in the '/etc/passwd' file. If an attacker succeeds in recovering the cleartext password of the identified hash value, he will be able to log in via SSH or Telnet and thus gain access to the underlying embedded Linux operating system on the device.
Proof of Concept
================
1. Connect to the device
2. Read '/etc/passwd'
root:!:0:0:root:/root:/bin/sh
F4Gt6debUqxFA3PR:p6j[...]y5U:0:0:root:/:/bin/sh
nobody:x:0:0:nobody:/nonexistent:/bin/false
Impact
======
The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the device.
Recommendation
==============
The hardcoded credentials have been removed from the firmware in version 2.12/2.13. Therefore, the firmware of the device should be updated to the latest version.
Affected Devices
================
- D-Link DSR-500N (1.02)
Timeline
========
2021-08-07: Vendor informed via email
2021-08-10: Vendor answered and stated that the affected products have reached their End-of-Service-Life
2021-08-17: Vendor published an announcement about the affected products

Recommendation for End of Support /End of Life Products

From time to time, D-Link will decide that some of its products have reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life (“EOL”). D-Link may choose to EOS/EOL a product due to evolution of technology, market demands,  new innovations, product efficiencies based on new technologies, or the product matures over time and should be replaced by functionally superior technology.

**For US Consumer**

If a product has reached End of Support ("EOS") / End of Life ("EOL"), there is normally no further extended support or development for it.

Typically for these products, D-Link will be unable to resolve device or firmware issues since all development and customer support has ceased.

D-Link strongly recommends that this product be retired and cautions that any further use of this product may be a risk to devices connected to it. If US consumers continue to use these devices against D-Link's recommendation, please make sure the device has the most recent firmware, make sure you frequently update the device's unique password to access its web-configuration, and always have WIFI encryption enabled with a unique password.
