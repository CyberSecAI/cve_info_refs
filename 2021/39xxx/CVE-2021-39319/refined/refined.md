The provided content is related to CVE-2021-39319.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `duoFAQ â€“ Responsive, Flat, Simple FAQ` WordPress plugin is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting due to insufficient escaping and the use of the `msg` parameter found in the `~/duogeek/duogeek-panel.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Insufficient input sanitization and output escaping of the `msg` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts that will be executed in the context of the victim's browser when they are tricked into accessing a crafted link. This can be used to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing the malicious JavaScript code in the `msg` parameter, which is then reflected back in the page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a victim into clicking on it. No authentication is required.
