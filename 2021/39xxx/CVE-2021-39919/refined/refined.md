Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The reset password email link token and the new user email link token are being exposed in the logs. This occurs because the `ActionMailer::MailDeliveryJob` messages, which contain these tokens as arguments, are logged by `ActiveJob`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive tokens used for password reset and new user verification are being written to application logs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Account Takeover:** If an attacker gains access to the logs, they can obtain password reset tokens, potentially allowing them to reset passwords for existing accounts and gain unauthorized access.
- **Unauthorized Account Creation:** Similarly, new user email tokens could be used to bypass the verification process and create unauthorized accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker would need to gain access to the GitLab application logs. This could be achieved through various means, such as:
   - Compromising the server hosting the logs.
   - Exploiting other vulnerabilities to gain access to the file system or log management tools.
   - Social engineering to get access to the logs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have access to the application logs, whether through a compromised system, insider access, or other means of access to the log files.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in GitLab versions including at least 14.4-pre
- The `ActiveJob` logs both reset password and new user tokens.
- The suggested fix is to suppress `ActiveJob` messages entirely.
