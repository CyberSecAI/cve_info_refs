Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39225:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check within the Nextcloud Deck application's API. This oversight allows authenticated users to bypass intended access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing authorization check:** The core weakness is the absence of a proper permission check before allowing access to Deck cards. This enables a user to access resources not meant for them.
- **Inadequate Access Control:** The system fails to enforce the principle of least privilege, leading to unauthorized access to sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can access and potentially view Deck cards belonging to other users. The specific information contained in these cards might vary, but it could expose private data.
- **Confidentiality Breach:** The primary impact is a breach of confidentiality, as users can gain access to information that should only be visible to the owner of those cards.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through the Deck API, using a crafted request.
- Since it's an authenticated user issue, an attacker needs a valid account on the Nextcloud instance to exploit this.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user within the Nextcloud instance. They don't need special privileges, only a valid user account.
- The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the Deck API.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was present in Nextcloud Deck versions prior to 1.2.9, 1.4.5, and 1.5.3.
- The fix involves adding the missing permission check to ensure that only authorized users can access Deck cards.
- The issue was reported through HackerOne.
