- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient handling of HTTP requests leading to HTTP Request Smuggling.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from mitmproxy's inability to properly handle and differentiate between separate HTTP requests when a malicious client or server crafts requests to exploit discrepancies in how HTTP messages are interpreted. This allows for smuggling a request/response as part of another message body.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious client/server can smuggle requests through mitmproxy. These smuggled requests are not processed through mitmproxy's usual event hooks, bypassing any custom access control or sanitization measures implemented by users. This can potentially lead to arbitrary actions on the target server as well as exfiltration of data, depending on the specifics of the smuggled request.
- **Attack vectors**: Malicious HTTP requests from a client or server can exploit the vulnerability, targeting applications that use mitmproxy as a proxy.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a position to send HTTP requests to mitmproxy, either as a client or a server that mitmproxy proxies for.
