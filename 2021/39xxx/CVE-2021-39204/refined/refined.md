Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39204:

**CVE-2021-39204 is associated with CVE-2021-32778**

The content from `github.com_5f7d119e_20250114_190527.html` explicitly states "CVE ID CVE-2021-39204" and links it to a vulnerability in Envoy, which is further clarified by linking to the Envoy advisory for GHSA-3xh3-33v5-chcc. This GHSA advisory corresponds to CVE-2021-32778. Therefore CVE-2021-39204 is a vulnerability in Pomerium which is based on envoy and its underlying cause is CVE-2021-32778.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is an inefficient algorithm used by Envoy for resetting HTTP/2 streams. Specifically, the operation has O(N^2) complexity where N is the number of streams, leading to high CPU utilization when many streams are reset.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Algorithmic Complexity Vulnerability:** The core weakness is the inefficient algorithm with O(N^2) time complexity for resetting HTTP/2 streams.
- **Excessive Resource Consumption:** This inefficient algorithm leads to excessive CPU consumption when a large number of HTTP/2 streams are reset simultaneously.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of exploiting this vulnerability is a Denial of Service. By opening and rapidly resetting a large number of HTTP/2 streams, an attacker can force the affected Envoy instance to consume excessive CPU resources, potentially leading to service unavailability.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious HTTP/2 Client:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by acting as a malicious HTTP/2 client.
- **Stream Reset:** The attacker opens a large number of HTTP/2 streams and then immediately resets them.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to establish a network connection to the vulnerable Envoy instance.
- **HTTP/2 Client:** The attacker needs to be able to act as an HTTP/2 client and send requests with the ability to open and reset streams.
- **No Authentication Required**: The attacker does not require any specific credentials or user privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- **Versions Affected:** Envoy versions 1.16.4, 1.17.3, 1.18.3 and 1.19.0 are vulnerable.
- **Patched Versions:** Envoy versions 1.16.5, 1.17.4, 1.18.4, and 1.19.1 contain fixes for this issue.
- **Workaround:** For Envoy version 1.16 which could not be backported with the fix, a workaround is to limit the number of simultaneous HTTP/2 streams to a low number like 10.
- **Pomerium:** The vulnerability also affects Pomerium versions <=0.14.7 and 0.15.0, as Pomerium is based on Envoy. Patched versions for Pomerium are 0.14.8 and 0.15.1.
- **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-834 (Excessive Iteration).
