Hello Envoy Community,

We would like to announce the availability of Envoy **1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4****,** and **1.16.5**!
These versions contain fixes for the following CVE(s):

* **CVE-2021-32777** (CVSS score 8.6, High): Envoy through 1.19.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request with multiple value headers may bypass authorization policies in ext\_authz extension.
* **CVE-2021-32779** (CVSS score 8.6, High): Envoy through 1.19.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an HTTP request with #fragment in the URI path may bypass Envoy’s URI path based authorization policies.
* **CVE-2021-32781** (CVSS score 8.6, High): Envoy through 1.19.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability that affects Envoy's decompressor, json-transcoder or grpc-web extensions or proprietary extensions that modify and increase the size of request or response bodies. Modifying and increasing the size of the body in an Envoy’s extension beyond internal buffer size may lead to Envoy accessing deallocated memory and terminating abnormally.
* **CVE-2021-32778** (CVSS score 8.6, High): Envoy through 1.19.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an Envoy client opening and then resetting a large number of HTTP/2 requests may lead to excessive CPU consumption.
  IMPORTANT: Due to significant divergence in affected source code between Envoy versions 1.16 and 1.17 it is not feasible to backport the fix into the 1.16 stable branch without increasing the risk of destabilizing it. As a result, operators of Envoy version 1.16 are recommended to limit the number of simultaneous HTTP/2 streams for upstream and downstream peers to a low number, i.e. 10.
* **CVE-2021-32780** (CVSS score 8.6, High): Envoy 1.18 through 1.19.1 contains a remotely exploitable vulnerability where an untrusted upstream service may cause Envoy to terminate abnormally by sending the GOAWAY frame followed by the SETTINGS frame with the SETTINGS\_MAX\_CONCURRENT\_STREAMS parameter set to 0.
  Note: this vulnerability does not impact downstream client connections.

Upgrading to **1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4,**or**1.16.5**is encouraged to fix these issues.

Documentation for all versions can be found at <https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs>.

**For v1.19.1:**GitHub tags: <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases/tag/v1.19.1>
Docker images: docker pull envoyproxy/envoy:v1.19.1
Release notes: <https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.19.1/version_history/current>

**For v1.18.4:**GitHub tags: <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases/tag/v1.18.4>
Docker images: docker pull envoyproxy/envoy:v1.18.4
Release notes: <https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.18.4/version_history/current>

**For v1.17.4:**GitHub tags: <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases/tag/v1.17.4>
Docker images: docker pull envoyproxy/envoy:v1.17.4
Release notes: <https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.17.4/version_history/current>

**For v1.16.5:**GitHub tags: <https://github.com/envoyproxy/envoy/releases/tag/v1.16.5>
Docker images: docker pull envoyproxy/envoy:v1.16.5
Release notes: <https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.16.5/version_history/current>

Note the Docker images and release notes are pending to CI progress so they might not be immediately available.

Checking whether you are vulnerable:
Run `envoy --version` and if it indicates a base version matching or older than **1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4,**or**1.16.5** you are running a vulnerable version.

Thank you to Chaoqin Li, Yangmin Zhu, Raul Gutierrez Segales and Nikolas Koutounidis for making this release happen. A lot of work happens behind the scenes!

Cheers,
Adi Peleg, Yan Avlasov and Lizan Zhou (on behalf of the Envoy security team and maintainers)

# Excessive CPU usage

High

[travisgroth](/travisgroth)
published
GHSA-5wjf-62hw-q78r
Sep 9, 2021

## Package

gomod

pomerium
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

<=0.14.7, 0.15.0

## Patched versions

0.15.1,0.14.8

## Description

Envoy, which Pomerium is based on, incorrectly handles resetting of HTTP/2 streams with excessive complexity. This can lead to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset.

### Impact

This can result in a DoS condition.

### Patches

Pomerium versions 0.14.8 and 0.15.1 contain an upgraded envoy binary with this vulnerability patched.

### Workarounds

N/A

# Excessive CPU utilization when closing HTTP/2 streams

High

[lizan](/lizan)
published
GHSA-3xh3-33v5-chcc
Aug 24, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

1.19.0, 1.18.3, 1.17.3, 1.16.4

## Patched versions

1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4

## Description

CVSS score 8.6 (High), Vector: [CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:L)

Envoy’s procedure for resetting a HTTP/2 stream has O(N^2) complexity, leading to high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset.

### Impact

Denial of Service when Envoy is configured with high limit on HTTP/2 concurrent streams.

### Attack vector

A client opening and closing a large number of HTTP/2 streams.

### Patches

Envoy versions 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4 contain fixes to reduce time complexity of resetting HTTP/2 streams.

**IMPORTANT:** Due to significant divergence in affected source code between Envoy versions 1.16 and 1.17 it is not feasible to backport the fix into the the 1.16 stable branch without increasing the risk of destabilizing it. As a result operators of Envoy version 1.16 are recommended to apply workaround listed below. See [recommended edge settings](https://www.envoyproxy.io/docs/envoy/v1.16.3/configuration/best_practices/edge) for instructions about changing this setting.

### Workarounds

Limit the number of simultaneous HTTP/2 streams for upstream and downstream peers to a low number, i.e. 10.
