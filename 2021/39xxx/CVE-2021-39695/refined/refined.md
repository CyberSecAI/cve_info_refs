Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-39695

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of this vulnerability lies in an inconsistency between the protection level stored in `BasePermission.perm.protectionLevel` and the value returned by `BasePermission.getProtectionLevel()`. This inconsistency could occur when adding or removing elements from the `InProgress` array in `AttributedAppOps`. Specifically, if `finish()` and then `start()` are called, the array could be reallocated. This would cause the reference to point to an old location of the array, thus leading to an inconsistent state.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inconsistent Protection Level:** The core vulnerability is the potential for an inconsistent protection level within the `BasePermission` object. This inconsistency arises because the stored protection level and the calculated protection level can differ.
- **Incorrect Array Reference:** The vulnerability occurs when the `InProgress` array in `AttributedAppOps` is reallocated. The existing references are not updated and point to the old location of the array, resulting in the inconsistency.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exploit this inconsistency to gain elevated privileges. This is categorized as an "Elevation of Privilege" (EoP) vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves manipulating the application's permission state and potentially triggering the conditions that lead to the inconsistent protection level. This can be done by calling `finish()` and then `start()` methods on the `AttributedAppOps`, which could trigger the reallocation of the array and create an inconsistent state

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to be in a position to manipulate the system's permission state and specifically trigger the reallocation of the `InProgress` array in `AttributedAppOps` to exploit this vulnerability. This would most likely require local access to the device to manipulate the necessary APIs.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided code changes suggest that the fix involves updating the permission to resolve the inconsistency.
- The commit message mentions that the symptom no longer exists, indicating that the issue is resolved with the fix.
- The fix is related to a restriction (RESTRICT AUTOMERGE)
