{
  "CVE-2021-39152": {
    "Description": "A Server-Side Forgery Request can be activated unmarshalling with XStream to access data streams from an arbitrary URL referencing a resource in an intranet or the local host.",
    "Root cause": "The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in a server-side forgery request.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)"
    ],
    "Impact": "The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to request data from internal resources that are not publicly available only by manipulating the processed input stream.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Manipulating the processed input stream"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input stream that is being processed by XStream, injecting malicious objects.",
     "Affected Versions": "All versions until and including version 1.4.17 are affected, if using the version out of the box with Java runtime version 14 to 8."
