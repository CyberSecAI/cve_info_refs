Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-39503:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient input sanitization in the `WriteConfig()` function within PHPMyWind v5.6. Specifically, the function fails to properly filter out characters such as `<`, `>`, `?`, `=`, and `` ` ``.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The lack of proper input filtering allows an attacker to inject arbitrary PHP code into the `/include/config.cache.php` file via the `WriteConfig()` function.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application's filtering mechanism does not block key characters required to inject PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server.
*   This could lead to a complete compromise of the application, including data theft, modification, or even control of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The primary attack vector is through the `WriteConfig()` function, which is accessed when an administrator modifies site settings.
*   Specifically, the attacker modifies the site settings via POST request to the `/admin/site_save.php` file.
*   The attacker injects malicious code in the `site_key` parameter, and this code is then written to `config.cache.php`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Access:** The attacker must be logged in as an administrator to exploit the vulnerability, as it requires access to the site settings modification feature.

**Technical Details:**

*   The attacker injects php code by appending `?>` to close the existing php syntax, and then adding new PHP code like  `<?=`$_GET[0]`?>` to create a backdoor to execute code from GET parameters.
*   The injected code is then saved to the `/include/config.cache.php` file.
*   After this, the attacker can access any `/admin/*.php` file and execute the injected code.
*   The vulnerability is present in the `site_save.php` file which calls the `WriteF()` function.

**Additional Notes:**

* The vulnerability is present in PHPMyWind v5.6.
* There's a mention of "1nv1cta team, HPT CyberSecurity Center" being associated with the discovery.
* A PoC request and response are provided demonstrating the vulnerability.
