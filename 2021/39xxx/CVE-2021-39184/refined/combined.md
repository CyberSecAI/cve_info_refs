# Sandboxed renderers can obtain thumbnails of arbitrary files through the nativeImage API

Moderate

[MarshallOfSound](/MarshallOfSound)
published
GHSA-mpjm-v997-c4h4
Oct 12, 2021

## Package

npm

electron
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>=10.1.0 <11.0.0-beta.1 || >=11.0.0-beta.1 < 11.5.0 || >=12.0.0-beta.1 < 12.1.0 || >=13.0.0-beta.1 <13.3.0 || >=14.0.0-beta.1 <14.0.0 || >=15.0.0-alpha.1 <15.0.0-alpha.10

## Patched versions

11.5.0, 12.1.0, 13.3.0, 14.0.0, 15.0.0-alpha.10

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability allows a sandboxed renderer to request a "thumbnail" image of an arbitrary file on the user's system. The thumbnail can potentially include significant parts of the original file, including textual data in many cases.

All current stable versions of Electron are affected.

### Patches

This was fixed with [#30728](https://github.com/electron/electron/pull/30728), and the following Electron versions contain the fix:

* 15.0.0-alpha.10
* 14.0.0
* 13.3.0
* 12.1.0
* 11.5.0

### Workarounds

If your app enables `contextIsolation`, this vulnerability is significantly more difficult for an attacker to exploit.

Further, if your app does not depend on the `createThumbnailFromPath` API, then you can simply disable the functionality. In the main process, before the 'ready' event:

```
delete require('electron').nativeImage.createThumbnailFromPath
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
