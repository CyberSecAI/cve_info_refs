  "CVE-2021-39149": {
    "description": "XStream is vulnerable to an Arbitrary Code Execution attack. The processed stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. XStream creates therefore new instances based on these type information. An attacker can manipulate the processed input stream and replace or inject objects, that result in execution of arbitrary code loaded from a remote server.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Arbitrary Code Execution"
    ],
    "affected_versions": [
      "All versions until and including version 1.4.17 are affected, if using the version out of the box."
    ],
     "patched_versions": [
      "1.4.18"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability may allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code only by manipulating the processed input stream.",
    "attack_vector": "The processed input stream at unmarshalling time contains type information to recreate the formerly written objects. An attacker can manipulate the input stream and inject malicious objects.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the input stream processed by XStream.",
    "workarounds": "Setup XStream's security framework with a whitelist limited to the minimal required types."
    "credits": "Lai Han of NSFOCUS security team found and reported the issue to XStream and provided the required information to reproduce it."
