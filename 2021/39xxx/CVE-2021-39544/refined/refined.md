Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `file::WavFile::writeToFile` function, specifically at `wav_file.cpp:262:32` during a `memcpy` operation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow: Writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash/termination. This is evident from the AddressSanitizer output which ends with "ABORTING".
- Potential for arbitrary code execution. The ability to overwrite heap memory could lead to the ability to control program execution if the attacker can manipulate the content being copied and/or targets specific memory locations. (Although this is not explicitly demonstrated).

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a specially crafted WAV file. The provided PoC (`heap-overflow-writeToFile-wav_file-262.zip`) is likely an example of such a crafted file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious WAV file as input to the `sela` program. This could be done in a scenario where the program parses user-provided files, or where it processes files from a potentially untrusted source.
- The attacker needs to cause the execution path to reach `wav_file.cpp:262:32` with the malicious WAV file as input.

**More details than the official CVE description:**
- The provided content contains a specific code location, a stack trace, the address sanitizer report, and a proof-of-concept file, enabling a better understanding of the vulnerability. The provided address sanitizer report includes details about the memory region, the overflow and the exact location within the code and the libraries, also providing the size of the read that triggered the overflow. This information is more detailed than a basic description of the vulnerability.
