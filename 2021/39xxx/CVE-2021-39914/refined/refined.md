{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The regular expression used to remove trailing `.`, `.git` or `.atom` from namespace paths is vulnerable to regular expression denial of service due to backtracking issues.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Regular expression denial of service (ReDoS). The regex `(/(\.atom|\.git|\.)*\z/)` suffers from excessive backtracking when given long strings of periods.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious string can cause a maxed out CPU on the server. Repeating the attack could tie up a lot of resources on the machine running GitLab, leading to denial of service.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerable regex is executed on external input when provisioning accounts. An attacker can control the input string.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker can provide a long malicious string to the namespace path, which is used when provisioning accounts."
