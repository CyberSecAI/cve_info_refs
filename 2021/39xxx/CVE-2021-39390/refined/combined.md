# PartKeepr

## Open Source Inventory Management

How often have you ordered parts you already had in stock, but couldn't find them? How often did you forget
to re-order parts because your stock went low and you didn't notice? How often have you thought: „I
just ordered at my distributor, but forgot an important part?“

##

## Blazing Fast Part Search

The search functionality of PartKeepr allows you to search for many fields in seconds - no matter how
many parts you've got. You can also search for stock levels,
order numbers, manufacturers, distributors and more.

## Your Part Data - Edit Everything

You can enter all relevant data of your part - including as many distributors, manufacturers and
attachments as you require.

It is also possible to enter any part parameters you require. You can define any unit you like, may it
Ohms, Lux, Newton or Becquerel. That data can be used in the upcoming parametric search to find similar
parts.

##

##

## Keep Track of your Stock

Any additions or removals from the stock are tracked with the amount of parts added/removed, the user,
their price and optional comments. The global stock history view allows you to review any additions or
removals from the whole inventory.

Filtering by any parts which undercut the configured minimum stock level allows you to find any parts
which need reordering.

## Usability is key

PartKeepr was developed with usability as its first priority. You can sort and filter by virtually any
field, drag and drop parts into any category, hide and show additional fields as required and customize
the layout of PartKeepr as you require.

CSV and Excel export as well as CSV import helps you to interface with external systems. Barcode Scanner support allows you to retrieve part data without touching the keyboard.
