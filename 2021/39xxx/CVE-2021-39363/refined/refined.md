Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-39363:

**1. Verification:**

   - The content directly references "Security Notification Command Injection (HDZP252DI) - January 2022 (SN\_2022-01-26-01\_CVE-2021-39363)" in the "End of Support and Security Notices" section of the first document.
   - The second document, "Security Notification SN 2022-01-26 01," is explicitly about "IP PTZ Camera HDZP252DI Command Injection Vulnerability" and includes the CVE number.
   - Thus, the content is directly related to CVE-2021-39363.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - The vulnerability stems from the use of the insecure default Onvif protocol for controlling the PTZ camera. Specifically, when Onvif is not secured with TLS, the camera is susceptible to command injection via pan, tilt and zoom functionality.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the camera via the insecure Onvif interface.
   - **Insecure Default Protocol:**  The usage of non-TLS Onvif as the default communication channel is a weakness.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - An attacker can potentially manipulate the camera's pan, tilt, and zoom functions by injecting malicious commands.
   - The specific impact of this exploitation is not detailed further in this document.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

    - **Network-based:** The attack vector is network-based, taking advantage of unencrypted Onvif communication.
  
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable camera, or have the ability to communicate to the camera on the network
   - **Knowledge of Onvif Protocol:** The attacker needs some knowledge of the Onvif protocol to craft the command injection.
    - The vulnerability is exploitable by an unauthenticated user on the network.
  
**Additional Details:**

- The document provides a link to the CVSS calculator for a more detailed breakdown of the vulnerability score.
- The document recommends updating the camera's firmware to mitigate the vulnerability. It also suggests network isolation via firewall, DMZ or VPN as further protections.

- The document provides a link to a Honeywell support site for the updated firmware.

-  The document does not specify the exact method used for the injection (i.e., http request, specific fields etc.)
