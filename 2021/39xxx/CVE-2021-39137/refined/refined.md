Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-39137

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A memory corruption bug within the Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) related to how `RETURNDATA` is handled when using `datacopy` instruction. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to how the EVM handles copying data from the return data buffer into memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Memory corruption. The vulnerability causes a consensus error due to a discrepancy in `stateRoot` calculations when processing a crafted transaction, leading to chain splits

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Consensus error causing a chain split.
- Vulnerable nodes reject the canonical chain, resulting in a minority chain split.
-  This bug was exploited on Mainnet at block 13107518, leading to a minority chain split.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A maliciously crafted transaction that triggers the vulnerable `datacopy` instruction in the EVM.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and broadcast a transaction that exploits the vulnerability in the EVM.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in all Geth versions supporting the London hard fork and predates London.
- The vulnerability was discovered during an audit of the Telos EVM.
- The fix is included in Geth version `v1.10.8`.
- No workarounds exist other than updating to the patched version.
- The specific commit fixing the issue is available [here](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23381/commits/4d4879cafd1b3c906fc184a8c4a357137465128f)
