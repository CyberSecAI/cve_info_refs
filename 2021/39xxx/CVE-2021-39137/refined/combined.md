Geth v1.10.8 is a pre-announced ***hotfix release to patch a vulnerability in the EVM*** (`CVE-2021-39137`).

The exact attack vector will be provided at a later date to give node operators and dependent downstream projects time to update their nodes and software. All Geth versions supporting the London hard fork are vulnerable (the bug is older than London), so all users should update.

Credits for the discovery go to [@guidovranken](https://github.com/guidovranken) (working for [Sentnl](https://sentnl.io/) during an audit of the [Telos EVM](https://www.telos.net/evm)) and reported via bounty@ethereum.org.

Beside the fix, we're merged in a few tiny polishes and fixes. For a rundown, please consult the Geth 1.10.8 [release milestone](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/milestone/120?closed=1).

# RETURNDATA corruption via datacopy

published
GHSA-9856-9gg9-qcmq
Aug 24, 2021

## Package

gomod

go-ethereum
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 1.10.0

## Patched versions

1.10.8

## Description

### Impact

A vulnerability in the Geth EVM could cause a node to reject the canonical chain.

### Description

A memory-corruption bug within the EVM can cause a consensus error, where vulnerable nodes obtain a different `stateRoot` when processing a maliciously crafted transaction. This, in turn, would lead to the chain being split in two forks.

All Geth versions supporting the London hard fork are vulnerable (which predates London), so all users should update.

This bug was exploited on Mainnet at block 13107518, leading to a minority chain split.

### Patches

A patch is included in the `v1.10.8` release.

The exact patch to fix the issue is contained within this [commit](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/pull/23381/commits/4d4879cafd1b3c906fc184a8c4a357137465128f)

### Workarounds

No workarounds exist, save to update and/or apply the patch commit.

### References.

Post-mortem [write-up](https://github.com/ethereum/go-ethereum/blob/master/docs/postmortems/2021-08-22-split-postmortem.md).

### Credits

The bug was found by [@guidovranken](https://github.com/guidovranken) (working for [Sentnl](https://sentnl.io/) during an audit of the [Telos EVM](https://www.telos.net/evm)) and reported via bounty@ethereum.org.
