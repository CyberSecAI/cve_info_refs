Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-39509:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of HTTP request parameters within the `/goform/form2userconfig.cgi` route of the D-Link DIR-816 router's firmware. Specifically, the `username` parameter is used to construct a command to delete a user. However, this parameter isn't properly sanitized, allowing for shell metacharacters to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. By injecting shell metacharacters into the `username` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router's operating system.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The router's firmware fails to sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `username` parameter, before using it in a system command.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands with the privileges of the web server process. This could lead to:
    *   Complete compromise of the router.
    *   Installation of malware.
    *   Data exfiltration.
    *   Denial of service.
    *   Further attacks on the network behind the router.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attack is performed by crafting a malicious HTTP POST request to the `/goform/form2userconfig.cgi` endpoint. The `username` parameter within the POST data is the injection point.
*   **Base64 Encoding:** The provided exploit uses Base64 encoding to obfuscate the injected shell commands. This is necessary as part of the specific implementation of the command execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router's web interface. This would typically be from the local network but could be exposed via port forwarding or a misconfigured firewall.
*   **Authentication (Potentially):** The attacker needs to obtain a valid `tokenid` first and include this with the malicious request. While the provided information does not clearly state if the attacker needs to be logged in,  it is suggested the attacker needs to be able to configure the router, implying the need for valid credentials.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know about the existence and functionality of the `/goform/form2userconfig.cgi` endpoint and the vulnerable parameter.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Firmware Version:** The vulnerability has been confirmed on firmware version `DIR-816A2_FWv1.10CNB05_R1B011D88210`.
*   **Vendor:** The affected vendor is D-Link.
*   **Device:** The specific router model affected is the DIR-816 750M 11ac wireless router.
*   **Proof-of-Concept (POC):**  A POC is provided including a curl command to obtain the `tokenid` and a curl command with a crafted POST request.
