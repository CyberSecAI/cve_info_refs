- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "disqualify lead" action in OroCRM does not properly check for a CSRF token.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). The application does not validate the authenticity of the request, allowing an attacker to perform actions on behalf of an authenticated user.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can disqualify any lead in the CRM, leading to potential disruption of business processes. This is considered a low impact on integrity and availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, where the attacker crafts a malicious request and tricks a logged-in user into executing it.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to craft a CSRF attack and needs a logged-in user to be tricked into executing it, this requires user interaction.
