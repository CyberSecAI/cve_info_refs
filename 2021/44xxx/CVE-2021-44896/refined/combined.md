### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v3.0.3...v3.0.4`

Thanks for tackling this one [@martaribeiro](https://github.com/martaribeiro).

I think it would good to move this into the base application\_record.rb file that all of the models inherit from. Something like:

```
class ApplicationRecord < ActiveRecord::Base

   #  other existing methods

   def sanitize_fields(*attrs)
     attrs.each do |attr|
       self.send("#{attr.to_s}=", ActionController::Base.helpers.sanitize(self.send(attr)))
     end
   end
```

Then, in the models you can do something like:

`before_save sanitize_fields(:title, :funder_name, :grant_number, :identifier, :description)`

Sorry, something went wrong.
