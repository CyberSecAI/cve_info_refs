- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not prevent untrusted HTML from reaching the `jQuery.htmlPrefilter` method of jQuery.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). Untrusted HTML is not sanitized before being processed by jQuery, leading to potential script injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: By injecting malicious HTML into fields or parameters that are processed by the vulnerable code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious HTML into the application via a user-controlled field.
