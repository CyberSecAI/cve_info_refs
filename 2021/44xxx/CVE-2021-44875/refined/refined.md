- Root cause of vulnerability: The password recovery procedure provides different messages depending on whether the user exists or not.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: User enumeration vulnerability.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker can determine valid users, which enables brute force attacks against user passwords.
- Attack vectors: Network based, through password recovery functionality.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: No special capabilities are required. The attacker only needs to use the password recovery feature.
