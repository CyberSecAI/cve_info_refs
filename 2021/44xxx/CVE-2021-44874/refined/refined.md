Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44874:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from insecure design where the Systeam ERP application's bi report module directly executes SQL commands provided in POST data, effectively turning the endpoint into a SQL prompt.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **SQL Injection:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate the user-provided SQL commands, making it vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A malicious actor can execute arbitrary SQL commands. This can lead to:
    *   **Data Breach:** Accessing, modifying, or deleting sensitive data in the database (Confidentiality, Integrity impact - High).
    *   **System Compromise:**  Potentially escalating privileges, modifying application logic, or gaining access to the underlying server (Availability impact - High).

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is via the network (AV:N).
*   The attacker sends malicious SQL commands via POST data to the bi report endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Low Privilege:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (PR:L).
*   **No User Interaction:**  No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (UI:N)
*   **Low Complexity:** The attack is relatively easy to perform (AC:L).

**Additional Information:**
*   The affected version is 2.22.8 build 1724.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under OWASP TOP 10 A04:2021-Insecure Design.
*   The CVSS score is 8.8, indicating a high severity.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Douglas Secco dos Santos of DropReal Brasil.
