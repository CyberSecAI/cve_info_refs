Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-44446:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is an out-of-bounds write vulnerability in the JTTK library when parsing specially crafted JT files. This write occurs past the end of an allocated structure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-787:** Out-of-bounds Write

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process. This could lead to a compromise of the system where the affected software is running.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted JT file. A user must be tricked into opening this malicious file using one of the vulnerable products (JT Utilities or JTTK).
- The attack is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the local file system and convince the victim to open a file using the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious JT file.
- The attacker needs to convince a user to open the malicious JT file with the vulnerable application (JT Utilities or software that uses JTTK). User interaction is required (UI:R).
- No special privileges are needed (PR:N).
