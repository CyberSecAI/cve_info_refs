      "details": "This document provides release notes for GT.M V7.0-002, detailing fixes and enhancements. Several issues related to memory management, string handling, and command processing were addressed. Specifically:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability**\n\n*   **Memory Management:** Uncontrolled memory allocation could lead to segmentation faults (SIG-11) or other memory-related errors, particularly when handling large strings or deeply nested patterns, or when a process exceeds its memory limits. Additionally there were issues with literal arguments causing numeric overflow.\n*   **String Handling:** Operations involving non-graphic character replacement with `$[Z]CHAR()` representations could cause issues if the resulting string exceeded 1MiB. The functions $FNUMBER() and $JUSTIFY() also had issues where results could cause a segmentation violation (SIG-11).\n*   **Command Processing:** Certain arguments for the `USE SOCKET` command, along with indirect arguments with missing parentheses and malformed global names could cause crashes. Additionally, some edge cases in the handling of `VIEW "NOISOLATION"` and the `ZSHOW` command could cause segmentation faults.\n*  **Pattern Matching:** Deeply nested patterns with many indefinite ranges could cause stack overflows and crashes.\n*   **CTRAP:** Incorrectly recognizing non-control characters. \n*  **Indirection:** Comments at the end of the value of the variable in indirect calls, and using empty string expressions could lead to issues.\n*   **Error Handling:** Incorrectly setting the \$ZTRAP variable, and a process handling SIGHUPs was not working as intended.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**\n\n*   **Buffer Overflow:** Operations did not always properly validate string lengths, allowing operations to pass strings to other operations that did not have provisions for longer than 1MiB strings, which could lead to buffer overflows.\n*   **Improper Input Validation:** The lack of input validation allowed malformed or excessively large arguments to cause crashes or unexpected behavior. Several functions/commands failed to handle large values appropriately, including the `SOCKET` device parameters, literal arguments that caused numeric overflow, and global names in the VIEW command.\n*   **Stack Overflow:** Deeply nested patterns could cause a stack overflow.\n*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Uncontrolled memory allocation could result in resource exhaustion and system instability.\n*   **Logic Errors:** Some operations such as the handling of literal FALSE post conditionals, the compiler dealing with argument-less BREAK and NEW commands, and the $ZTRAP variable assignment had logic errors that resulted in crashes.\n*  **Asynchronous events:** Asynchronous events like MUPIP STOP at inopportune times could cause a segmentation violation (SIG-11).\n*  **Auto-relink:** Auto-relink control structures could be corrupted leading to segmentation faults.\n\n**Impact of Exploitation**\n\n*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Crashes due to segmentation faults, stack overflows, or resource exhaustion could lead to denial of service.\n*   **Information Exposure:** In some cases, the application might expose internal memory structures which could provide attackers with information about the system.\n*   **Data Corruption:** Logic errors could lead to incorrect data handling and potential corruption.\n*   **Application Instability:**  Unstable process behavior due to unhandled errors and resource leaks.\n\n**Attack Vectors**\n\n*   **Malicious Input:** Crafted input designed to trigger vulnerabilities in string handling and command processing could be used to launch an attack.\n*   **Unusual Program Logic:** Exploiting logic errors through unusual program sequences. Malicious code may be placed within comments to trigger bugs during indirect calls\n*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Forcing a program to allocate large amounts of memory to crash it. \n*   **Asynchronous Operations:** Abusing asynchronous events such as MUPIP STOP to interrupt critical operations and cause crashes\n*   **Abuse of auto-relink:** Causing integrity errors in the auto-relink structures to crash the program.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**\n\n*   Ability to input and manipulate strings and parameters of GT.M applications.\n*   Ability to execute code within the GT.M environment.\n*   In some cases, the ability to cause specific asynchronous events through commands like MUPIP STOP.\n\n**Mitigation**\n*   Input validation, resource limits with $ZMALLOCLIM, proper string length handling, and better error handling to prevent similar vulnerabilities.\n*   The release contains several fixes addressing all the mentioned vulnerabilities, including checks to avoid recursion, stack overflows, and memory exhaustion, as well as improved command processing and input validation.",
