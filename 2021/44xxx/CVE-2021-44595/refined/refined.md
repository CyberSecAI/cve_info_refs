      "vulnerability": {
        "root_cause": "The Dr.Fone application uses a service called 'ElevationService.exe' that listens on port 12345. This service receives a path to an executable via network packets and executes it.  The path is prepended with either 'system_s' or 'elevat_s'. Furthermore, the service uses a hardcoded localhost IP address (127.0.0.1) which can be changed via hex editing to allow for remote code execution.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Insecure network communication.",
          "Lack of input validation on the executable path.",
          "Hardcoded localhost IP address.",
		  "Use of msgpack library for network communication",
          "Elevation service persists even after uninstall."

		"root_cause": "The 'InstallAssist' service listens on a random UDP port, which is stored in 'C:\\ProgramData\\Wondershare\\ModuleUpgrade\\port'. The service receives commands via network packets with the format: filePath, Parameters, Authority, and CallPid. The service uses these commands to execute a file with the given parameters and user context. This allows for arbitrary code execution.",
