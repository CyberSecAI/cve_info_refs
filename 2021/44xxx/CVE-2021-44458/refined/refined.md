- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Lack of websocket authentication in Lens application.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Lens application on Linux systems does not properly authenticate websocket connections, allowing an attacker to establish a connection to the Lens application through a malicious website.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the victim's machine with the privileges of the Lens user.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker hosts a malicious website, and the victim visits this site using their browser while having Lens running. The malicious website then makes unauthorized websocket connections to Lens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker must be able to host a malicious website.
  - The attacker needs to know the cluster ID of at least one of the victim's clusters.
  - The Lens application needs to be running on a Linux system.
  - The victim needs to visit the malicious site.
