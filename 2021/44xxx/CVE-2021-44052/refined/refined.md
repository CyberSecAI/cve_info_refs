- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper link resolution before file access ("link following")
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system does not properly validate links before accessing files, allowing for path traversal.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote attackers can traverse the file system to unintended locations and read or overwrite files.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the improper link resolution to access files outside of the intended scope.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected QNAP device.
