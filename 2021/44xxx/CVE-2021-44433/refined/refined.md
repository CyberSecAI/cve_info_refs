- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The JTTK library contains a use-after-free vulnerability. This occurs when memory is accessed after it has been freed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use-after-free (CWE-416)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious JT file. The attacker needs to be in a position to provide this file to the user.
