Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44716:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `net/http` package of the Go programming language. Specifically, it's related to uncontrolled memory consumption in the header canonicalization cache when processing HTTP/2 requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400):** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper limits on the growth of the header canonicalization cache. This can lead to excessive memory usage.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can result in a denial-of-service condition, making the affected server unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via network access using HTTP/2 requests.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Remote attacker (AV:N):** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without needing any prior access or credentials.
- **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is easy to execute.
- **No Privilege Required (PR:N):** The attacker doesn't need any specific privileges on the target system.
- **No User Interaction Required (UI:N):** The attack can be launched without any interaction from the user.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is present in Go versions before 1.16.12 and 1.17.x before 1.17.5.
- The issue is also fixed in `golang.org/x/net/http2` v0.0.0-20211209124913-491a49abca63, for users manually configuring HTTP/2.
-  A temporary workaround is to disable HTTP/2 by setting the `GODEBUG=http2server=0` environment variable.
-  The vulnerability is also identified as Go issue `go.dev/issue/50058`.
-  The Debian LTS advisory mentions that this vulnerability could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) in specific situations.
- Multiple NetApp products are affected and require patching.
