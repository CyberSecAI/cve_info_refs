Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-44108:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

1.  **Memory Corruption (Stack Overflow):** The `parse_multipart` function in `lib/sbi/message.c` doesn't properly handle a large number of parts in a multipart/related HTTP request. The `multipart_parser_data_s` structure, which stores information about each part, has a fixed size (`OGS_SBI_MAX_NUM_OF_PART` which is 8). When the number of parts in the incoming request exceeds this limit, a stack buffer overflow occurs, leading to memory corruption.
2.  **Null Pointer Dereference:** In the `amf_namf_comm_handle_n1_n2_message_transfer` function in `src/amf/namf-handler.c`, the code can reach a point where `n2InfoContent` is not initialized (when `n2_info_container` is null), leading to dereferencing a null pointer when accessing `n2InfoContent->ngap_ie_type`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The fixed-size array in `multipart_parser_data_s` creates a classic stack buffer overflow vulnerability.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** Lack of proper null checks before accessing `n2InfoContent` results in a null pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:**  A successful stack overflow can overwrite adjacent memory on the stack, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or denial of service.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  The null pointer dereference will cause the program to crash, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Multipart Request Overflow:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request with a `Content-Type: multipart/related` header and an excessive number of parts to the AMF.
*   **Missing n2\_info\_container:** Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `namf-comm/v1/ue-contexts/{imsi}/n1-n2-messages` endpoint with a JSON payload that does not contain an `n2_info_container`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the AMF service, which is typically exposed on the network.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker must be aware of the AMF API endpoints and the expected request formats.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was reported by "leommxj" from Chaitin Security Research Lab.
*   The memory corruption vulnerability is located in `lib/sbi/message.c`, specifically within the `parse_multipart` function.
*   The null pointer dereference vulnerability is located in `src/amf/namf-handler.c`, specifically in the `amf_namf_comm_handle_n1_n2_message_transfer` function.
*   The vulnerabilities were addressed in commit `d919b2744cd05abae043490f0a3dd1946c1ccb8c`.
*   The fix includes adding a check to ensure `data->num_of_part` does not exceed `OGS_SBI_MAX_NUM_OF_PART` and handling the null `n2InfoContent` case.
