- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied inputs in the login functionality. Specifically, the `username` and `Password` parameters in the `index.php` file are directly used in a SQL query without proper escaping or sanitization.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application directly incorporates user inputs into the SQL query without using functions like `mysqli_real_escape_string` which leads to SQL Injection vulnerability

- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Authentication bypass: An attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism by crafting malicious SQL injection payloads in the username or password fields. This can lead to unauthorized access to the admin panel.
  - Sensitive data manipulation: After gaining unauthorized access, the attacker can potentially destroy, change, or manipulate sensitive data within the system.

- **Attack vectors:**
  - The attack vector is through the login form, specifically the `username` and `Password` parameters of index.php.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be able to access the login form of the application, which is generally public or accessible within an organization's network. No special privileges or internal network access is required for this exploit.
