  "description": "An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists when reading a TIF file using Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2022.12. The specific issue exists after loading TIF files. An unchecked input data from a crafted TIF file leads to an out-of-bounds read. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by unchecked input data from a crafted TIF file.",
    "weakness": "Out-of-bounds Read due to improper input validation.",
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "To exploit the vulnerability, a malicious TIF file must be read using the ODA Drawings SDK.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted TIF file to the application using the vulnerable ODA Drawings SDK."
