Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by an out-of-bounds read when processing a specific project file in Delta Electronics CNCSoft software.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software fails to properly validate the data being read from a project file, leading to an out-of-bounds memory access (CWE-125).
* **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to information disclosure (reading potentially sensitive data from memory) or an application crash, which could cause a denial of service.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have access to the vulnerable software and the ability to load a specially crafted project file.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to supply the vulnerable software with a malicious project file. This means they need to have local access to the system. User interaction (opening/loading the malicious file) is also required.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects CNCSoft versions 1.01.30 and prior.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.1. The CVSS vector string is (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:L), indicating a local attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, user interaction needed, and a potential for high impact on confidentiality and low impact on availability.
*   The advisory notes that this is not exploitable remotely.
