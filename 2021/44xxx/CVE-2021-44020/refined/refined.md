Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from allowing an untrusted process to impersonate the client of a pipe within the Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security's Security Server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unnecessary Privileges:** The software grants excessive permissions, allowing a low-privileged process to impersonate another with higher privileges.
*   **Insecure Pipe Handling:** The vulnerability arises from the improper handling of inter-process communication pipes, specifically how the server allows impersonation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to gain SYSTEM-level privileges.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** With elevated privileges, the attacker can execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access Required:** The attacker must already have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
*   **Exploitation of Inter-process Communication:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by manipulating the named pipe communication between processes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs a foothold on the target system, specifically, the capability to run low-privileged code.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability, identified as CVE-2021-44020, allows a local attacker to elevate their privileges to SYSTEM by exploiting a weakness in how Trend Micro Worry-Free Business Security handles named pipe communication. This allows them to execute arbitrary code on the system. The attacker must first be able to execute low-privileged code on the system to exploit this flaw.
