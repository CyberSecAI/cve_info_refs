Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- A global buffer overflow occurs in the `jfif_encode` function within `jfif.c` due to an oversized `memcpy`. Specifically, the code attempts to copy more bytes than the buffer can hold.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Global Buffer Overflow:** The `memcpy` operation at `jfif.c:708` attempts to copy data from global variables (`STD_HUFTAB_LUMIN_AC` and `STD_HUFTAB_LUMIN_DC`) into `jfif->phcac[0]->huftab` without proper bounds checking.
- The lengths of `STD_HUFTAB_LUMIN_AC` (178 bytes) and `STD_HUFTAB_LUMIN_DC` (28 bytes) are smaller than the copied length which is `MAX_HUFFMAN_CODE_LEN + 256` (272), leading to the overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The overflow overwrites memory beyond the intended buffer. This can lead to undefined behavior, potentially crashing the application or leading to further exploitation.
- **AddressSanitizer detected a crash:**  The AddressSanitizer output shows that the overflow corrupts memory which causes a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted JPEG file using the `-e` option to encode with the `ffjpeg` tool.
- The provided PoC file `encode_poc1.zip` triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious input file to be processed by the vulnerable `ffjpeg` application.
- No special privileges are needed for exploitation, just access to the `ffjpeg` application to run it with a malicious file.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is related to CVE-2020-23705, as they are both caused by an oversized memcpy.
- The fix was introduced in PR #45.
- The incorrect buffer size is `MAX_HUFFMAN_CODE_LEN + 256`
- `memcpy(jfif->phcac[0]->huftab, STD_HUFTAB_LUMIN_AC, MAX_HUFFMAN_CODE_LEN + 256);`
- The global variables `STD_HUFTAB_LUMIN_AC` and `STD_HUFTAB_LUMIN_DC` are defined in `huffman.c`
- The affected function is `jfif_encode` at `jfif.c:708`
