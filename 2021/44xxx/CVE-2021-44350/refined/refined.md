The content is related to CVE-2021-44350.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the `parseOrder` method of the `Builder` class within the ThinkPHP framework. The method directly concatenates unfiltered data into SQL queries, resulting in a SQL injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection due to insufficient data filtering in the `parseOrder` method.
- Direct string concatenation of user-supplied input into SQL queries.
- Lack of input validation and sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- Potential for unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- Possible compromise of the database and underlying system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by manipulating the `order` parameter in HTTP requests.
- By injecting malicious SQL code through parameters such as `name[name^updatexml(1,concat(0x7,user(),0x7e),1)%23]`.
- The vulnerable code can be triggered via the `Order` method of the `Query` class, the `find` method of the `Connection` class, and finally the `Select` method of the `Builder` class.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication required to exploit.
- Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is necessary to craft malicious payloads.
- No special privileges or user interaction are required for successful exploitation.
