- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JTTK library is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read when parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a maliciously crafted JT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious JT file and trick the user into opening it with an affected product.
