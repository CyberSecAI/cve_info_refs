- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JTTK library has an out-of-bounds read vulnerability when parsing JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the JTTK library parses a specially crafted JT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious file. The attacker needs local access, user interaction and does not require any privileges.
