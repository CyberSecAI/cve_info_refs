SSA-396621: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in JTTK before
V10.8.1.1 and JT Utilities before V12.8.1.1

SUMMARY

JT Open Toolkit (JTTK) before V10.8.1.1 contains multiple vulnerabilities that could be triggered when it
reads a maliciously crafted JT ﬁle. These vulnerabilities also affects JT Utilities before V12.8.1.1. If a
user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with any of the affected products, this could lead the application to
crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest versions and to limit opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources in the affected products.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources using JTTK

• Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources using JT Utilities

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

JT is an openly published data format developed by Siemens Digital Industries Software, widely used for
communication, visualization, digital mockup and a variety of other purposes. JT has been accepted by

SSA-396621

ISO as International Standard 14306:2017. The JT Utilities provide a series of command line utilities that
can be used to support application development and JT reuse.

JT Open Toolkit (also known as JTTK) is an application programming interface (API) for developers of
JT-enabled software. The JT Open Toolkit is a read/write toolkit that enables consistent access to JT ﬁle
content.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-44449

JTTK library in affected products contains an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure
while parsing specially crafted JT ﬁles. This could allow an attacker to execute code in the context of
the current process. (ZDI-CAN-14830)

Vulnerability CVE-2021-44450

JTTK library in affected products is vulnerable to an out of bounds read past the end of an allocated
buffer when parsing JT ﬁles. An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information in the
context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-15055, ZDI-CAN-14915, ZDI-CAN-14865)
