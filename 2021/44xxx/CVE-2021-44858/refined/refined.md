Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44858:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `undo` feature (`action=edit&undo=##&undoafter=###`), as well as the `mcrundo` and `mcrrestore` actions, lacked proper permission checks. This allowed unauthorized users to view the content of arbitrary revisions, regardless of their access rights.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Permission Checks:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of adequate authorization checks within the `undo`, `mcrundo`, and `mcrrestore` actions. These actions did not verify if a user had the necessary permissions to view the content of a specific revision.
*   **Information Disclosure:** This lack of checks resulted in an information disclosure vulnerability, allowing unauthorized users to view the content of revisions they should not have access to, including private revisions on private wikis.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Private Content:**  Attackers could potentially view the contents of private pages and revisions on wikis, particularly those using `$wgWhitelistRead` or similar mechanisms that make certain pages publicly accessible, but still containing potentially sensitive content in the page history.
*   **Bypass of Access Controls:**  The vulnerability allowed users to bypass access controls that were intended to protect page content.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers could exploit this by crafting specific URLs using the `action=edit&undo=##&undoafter=###`, `action=mcrundo`, or `action=mcrrestore` parameters, targeting specific revisions they wish to view.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic User Access:** An attacker only required basic user access to the MediaWiki instance, meaning any user account could exploit this vulnerability. No administrative or elevated privileges were needed.
*   **Knowledge of Revision IDs:** The attacker would need to know the revision IDs they wanted to view. This information could potentially be obtained from public page histories or other means.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue affected all MediaWiki versions since 1.23.0 until 1.34.x, and 1.35.x, 1.36.x, 1.37.x before the fixes
*   The fix involved implementing permission checks using `RevisionLookup::getRevisionByTitle()`
*   This vulnerability is related to CVE-2021-44857, which involves bypassing edit permissions using `mcrundo` and `mcrrestore`.
