- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in Adobe Prelude.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), requiring low attack complexity (AC:L). User interaction is required (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute code locally and convince a user to perform an action. The attacker does not require privileges (PR:N).
