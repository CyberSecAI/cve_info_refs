**Found By: Tomer Peled & Netanel Cohen**

**POC:**[**https://github.com/netanelc305/WonderShell**](https://github.com/netanelc305/WonderShell)

# **Background**

A few months ago, we released two articles (shamelessly plugged here) on Listary and Plex. The articles were about security vulnerabilities in their IPC communication (among other vulnerabilities). In our next vulnerability search, we focused on the misuse of socket communication and its consequences.

Enters Dr. Fone, a seemingly benign application to transfer data between two phones. Yet, as it turns out, it can be used as a “backdoor” that will not remove itself even after uninstallation.

We managed to gain an RCE from USER to SYSTEM(!!!) In two different ways — both of them were persistent on the system after the program’s removal

# **Elevation Service:**

We started by looking for a vulnerable application that listens for connections by using the process hacker’s network tab:

![]()

Dr.Fone outgoing communication

We now know that elevation service is listening on port 12345

We also noticed through Procmon that processes are being spawned under “ElevationService.exe”

We wanted to dig deeper, so we started by using the go-to tool for language identification Detect-It-Easy and this is its output for ElevationService and Dr. Fone

![]()

Main DrFone Detect It Easy Output

![]()

Elevation Service Detect It Easy output

Furthermore looking at the Wireshark communication on port 12345, we could see a path being passed to the service:

![]()

Packet containing exploitable string

Right before the path,we saw a string that was either system\_s or elevat\_s. We correlated between the string and the programs that were executed by “ElevationService.exe” ; it was a one-to-one match. A definite lead for an RCE.

We used Dnspy to reverse the main Dr.Fone component and search for the function that sends this packet . After a few searching and cross-referencing with Wireshark, we came across this snippet::

![]()

We started checking if we missed an RPC communication from the application.

We quickly saw that this was not a classic RPC communication through WinAPIs. We did this by looking at RPCView and by looking at the import table of the DLL:

![]()

Looking at the export table we found call\_s which is being imported into the c# main application:

![]()

y looking at the function’s instructions, we found the strings system\_s and elevat\_s:

![]()

call\_s snippet

By Importing this dll and function ourselves, we were able to reach an LPE execution:

![]()

LPE Execution

We found a hardcoded localhost(127.0.0.1) that was used in the packet creation.

By changing the hardcoded IP 127.0.0.1 with a hex editor, we could also reach our coveted RCE! But since this was a somewhat ugly implementation of an RCE, we tried to break the packet structure down.

While trying to reverse the DLL, we also decided to search the web for the hex bytes of the packet and were able to find out that this entire DLL is an implementation of the “msgpack” library!

Like the ones found here:

<https://github.com/msgpack-rpc/msgpack-rpc-cpp>

<http://msgpack.org/rpc/rdoc/current/MessagePack/RPC.html>

<https://pypi.org/project/msgpack/>

We then used the python implementation and were able to create a short script that will give us an RCE from USER to SYSTEM privileges by creating and sending packets.

# **InstallAssist**

As part of dr.Fone toolkit, it is possible to install different modules to handle different tasks, such as “WhatsApp Transfer”, ”Data Recover”.

![]()

Dr. Fone GUI

When asked to install a module, Dr. Fone will first download the module, and then the InstallAssistService will perform the actual installation.

After researching InstallAssistService.exe, we found that the service is listening on a random UDP port; furthermore, the port number is saved in the location:

“C:\ProgramData\Wondershare\ModuleUpgrade\port”

The service sends a packet containing the instruction on what to execute and under which context to execute it.

After a little reversing of the InstallAssist Service we found the following code snippet

![]()

The service logs EVERYTHING…. including error codes, the reason for failure, and most importantly, the received message format.

After inspecting the log files, it was easy to figure out the expected message structure:

filePath — File to execute.

Parameters — parameters.

Authority — under what user context to execute.

CallPid — doesn’t matter. It can be a random number.

![]()

InstallAssist log snippet

Finally, we created our payload with the same format and sent it to all UDP ports (since we attack remotely and have no way to know the specific port).

The payload, of course, can be customized for an LPE attack where the port is known from the file

![]()

exploit code snipet

Executable Path — Powershell.exe

Parameters — Reverse shell

Authority — Admin.

CallPid — Just a random number

And we got a SYSTEM shell.

![]()

SYSTEM privileges gained

## FAQ

* ## What is World Accelerator?

   World Accelerator is the first ever Domain Accelerator and gives entrepreneurs the opportunity to develop a business based on prime [Internet real estate](https://www.world.com/domains/). Over the last ten years, the cost and time needed to bring exciting and disruptive businesses to market has dramatically compressed. However, building credibility with customers, partners and your brand still takes time. World Accelerator changes this paradigm, turning it upside down as companies can now start with a powerful existing brand on day one.
* ## Where is World Accelerator located?

   World Accelerator is a global platform. While we are based in midtown New York our teams and affiliated companies are headquartered all around the world. Please reach us via our [Contact Us](https://www.world.com/contact/) form.
* ## What do you look for in a World Accelerator applicant?

   We look for focus, passion, and a team’s knowledge of their market. We also look for agile development experience. You must be able to deploy value rapidly to take advantage of the growth you can see from a great brand. We want to understand what is disruptive about a team’s plan or what is their unique value proposition. We look to understand your go to market and growth strategy and revenue and margin models. We like to also go deep to understand a team’s KPI’s (Key Performance Indicators) that you will be targeting. Finally, of course the clincher is in making sure all these elements can leverage and benefit from one of the World Accelerator domain brands.
* ## How are deals on the domains structured?

   It is important that any structure reflects the effort and commitment by entrepreneurs and that there is alignment with all parties. As a development team you want control and ownership over the brands you are developing. The use of one of our domain brands takes on the form of a very attractive license to allow the entrepreneur time to use and build into the brand without burdening your growth. The brand is an enabler and will further help you accelerate your plans. As you build your business you can acquire the brand at a capped price in the future or some other payout structure. This is set upfront which means as you prove successful, you get the upside for your efforts. World gets some ownership in the venture which gives World upside. The whole program allows for the right alignment and all parties benefit from the use of the brand.
* ## I need Capital, how can World help?

   World invests in companies from time to time. We tend to invest capital to accelerate growth once a team has demonstrated product market fit. We have also participated in follow-on investments in portfolio companies as parts of larger rounds. However, that is just a small part of our funding contribution. Our team has over 50 years of combined experience raising capital from a range of sources. We are well acquainted with the community of angel investors and venture capitalists and know how to find financing through seed funding, strategic debt, M&A and IPO’s. World Accelerator also works closely with our team to ensure they have the right components and a successful plan to access capital as needed.
