| \*\*There is a logical problem with the user registration page  After clicking the register button, the user does not need to confirm the email. The system directly saves the submitted content in the database.  This leads to a problem. An attacker can register with the mailbox of any user.

| That's true, but I'm not sure now much of a problem it is. If the malicious user uses a valid email address, the activation email will be sent to the real email account holder. If the submission queue is used, the email is sent upon approval. If the user submission is rejected, the record is deleted and available for re-registration. I suppose it wouldn't hurt to send an email to the new user even if queued, saying "your account is pending approval" … On Wed, Dec 8, 2021 at 10:18 PM Topsec\_bunney \*\*\*@\*\*\*.\*\*\*> wrote: \*\*There is a logical problem with the user registration page After clicking the register button, the user does not need to confirm the email.

| That would be a good security notice to tell someone that someone else is trying to use their email address. |

| User registration only has 3 paths - user is queued - in which case the user will receive an email when the account is approved - or the user is emailed their initial password - or the user enters their own password and receives a verification email. All 3 methods require the user to receive an email to proceed. So if your email is spoofed, you will be notified.  Currently, there are user administration tools that allow a site admin to manually purge accounts that never verified, etc.  I do think implementing a automatic purge of non-verified or non-logged into accounts after a configurable time period would be of value. |

| Move to 2.1.0 milestone - add capability in glFusion's cron to automatically purge aged accounts that have never logged in or completed validation step. |
