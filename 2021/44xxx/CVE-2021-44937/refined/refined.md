Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The core issue lies in the user registration process of glFusion CMS 1.7.9. Specifically, upon clicking the "register" button, the system directly saves the submitted user information into the database **without requiring email confirmation**.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Lack of Email Verification:** The most significant weakness is the absence of mandatory email verification during user registration. This allows arbitrary user registration using any email address.
*   **Direct Database Write:** The system writes user data to the database immediately after submission without verifying email ownership.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Email Address Squatting:** An attacker can register an account using any user's email address. This prevents legitimate users from registering with their own email, as the email is already associated with the attacker's account.
*   **Denial of Service (Potential):** If an attacker were to register a large number of accounts with arbitrary email addresses, it could potentially lead to a denial of service for legitimate users attempting to sign up. Although the comments discuss that email is sent upon approval, it is clear that the registration is done upfront without any verification.
*  **Notification Spoofing:** While not a primary impact, it was mentioned that activation emails will be sent to real email address holders if a valid email is used, creating a possibility for notification spoofing, and potentially raising user security concerns even when the account is queued for approval.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Registration Page:** The vulnerability is exploited through the user registration form of glFusion CMS 1.7.9.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker would need to access the registration page over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Public Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by simply having public network access to the glFusion CMS registration page.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No authentication is required to access the user registration page, making the vulnerability easily exploitable by anyone with network access to the site.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The issue is acknowledged by project contributors as an area of concern.
*   Mitigation strategies discussed include:
    *   Sending a "pending approval" email for queued registrations
    *   Automating the purging of non-verified accounts after a configurable time.
* While a user administration tool allows manual purging, it is not considered an ideal mitigation.
