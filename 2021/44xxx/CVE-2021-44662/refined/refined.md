Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44662:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of the `link` parameter in the `print/print.php` file within the Xerte application. This parameter is directly reflected in the HTML output, allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application directly reflects user-supplied input in the `link` parameter without proper encoding or sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser, within the context of the vulnerable web application. This can be used to:
    - Steal session cookies, potentially allowing account hijacking
    - Redirect users to malicious websites
    - Deface the webpage
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user
    - Access sensitive data accessible to the user

**Attack vectors:**
- **URL manipulation:** An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a crafted `link` parameter containing the malicious script.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would then need to trick a user into clicking on the specially crafted malicious URL for the XSS attack to occur.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker doesn't require any specific privileges or authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
- The attacker must be able to deliver a malicious URL to the user.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was found in the printing functionality of Xerte, specifically when a user provides a URL to their project for printing.
- The fix included sanitizing the input in the `print/print.php` file.
- The commit [694a591b5ab7f634f036afaac10397cf3677a98c](https://github.com/thexerteproject/xerteonlinetoolkits/commit/694a591b5ab7f634f036afaac10397cf3677a98c) addresses this XSS vulnerability along with other security issues.
