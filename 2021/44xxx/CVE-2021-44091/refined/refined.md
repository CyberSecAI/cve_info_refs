Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input sanitization in the `register.php` file of the "Multi Restaurant Table Reservation System" version 1.0. Specifically, the `fullname`, `phone`, and `address` parameters are vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The application does not sanitize user-provided input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters. This injected code is then stored in the database and executed when other users view the affected data, leading to XSS.
2.  **PHPSESSID Hijacking:** The vulnerability allows the attacker to potentially hijack legitimate user's PHP session IDs. This is likely due to the stored XSS vulnerability enabling the attacker to steal session cookies and reuse them to log in as the victim.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Malicious User Account Creation:** Attackers can create numerous malicious user accounts.
*   **Session Hijacking:** Attackers can hijack legitimate user sessions to gain unauthorized access and control.
*   **Data Manipulation:** With hijacked sessions, attackers can manipulate user data and possibly perform other malicious actions.
*   **Lures and Other Malicious purposes**: Attackers can use the created accounts for quality lures and other malicious purposes.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The primary attack vector is through the `register.php` page by submitting malicious payloads in `fullname`, `phone` and `address` fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the registration page of the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not require any specific privilege, just to be able to access the register form.
