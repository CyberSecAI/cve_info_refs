  "CVE-2021-44732": {
    "Metadata": {
      "Curation": "Confirmed",
      "Source": "Multiple Sources",
      "Source URLs": [
        "https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/tag/v2.28.0",
         "https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases",

        "https://github.com/Mbed-TLS/mbedtls/releases/tag/v3.1.0"

      ]
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "The vulnerability is due to a double-free condition that occurs when mbedtls_ssl_set_session() or mbedtls_ssl_get_session() fail with MBEDTLS_ERR_SSL_ALLOC_FAILED (out of memory).",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Double-free vulnerability"
      ],
      "Impact": "A double-free vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) or potentially arbitrary code execution.",
      "Attack Vectors": "An attacker could trigger the double-free by causing an out-of-memory condition during session setting or getting, likely through repeated connections or resource exhaustion.",
      "Required Capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to trigger memory allocation failures while establishing an SSL session. This would likely require a position to initiate or intercept TLS handshakes."
    },
    "Affected Versions": [
      "mbedtls versions before 2.28.0",
      "mbedtls versions before 3.1.0",
      "mbedtls version 2.16.9"
    ],
     "Patched Versions": [
      "mbedtls version 2.28.0",
      "mbedtls version 3.1.0",
      "mbedtls version 2.16.12",
