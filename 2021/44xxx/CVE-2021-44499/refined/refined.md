        "Improper handling of large arguments in SOCKET device commands leading to segmentation faults.",
        "Potential for segmentation faults due to issues with literal FALSE post conditionals in the compiler.",

        "Malformed global names in VIEW command causing segmentation fault.",
         "Segmentation faults with ZSHOW command when output is redirected to MUMPS local variable.",
        "Issues in $FNUMBER() and $JUSTIFY() functions with long results causing segmentation faults.",
        "Improper handling of indirect arguments combined with a missing closing parenthesis in a $INCREMENT() function leading to segmentation faults.",

         "Issues in $ZTRAP assignment",
         "Race conditions during routine management leading to segmentation fault.",
          "Integrity errors in auto-relink control structures causing crashes.",
         "Inadequate handling of disconnect/hangup events.",
        "MUPIP BACKUP ignoring user-specified order of regions.",
        "MUPIP LOAD -FORMAT=BINARY including key in record length check.",
         "Replication server not deferring TLS renegotiation",

         "Proactive database block splitting can cause data density reduction."
      ],
      "impact": "Exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to denial of service through segmentation faults (SIG-11), incorrect behavior, unexpected program termination, potential data corruption, or exposure of sensitive information.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Specially crafted input to vulnerable functions or commands.",
         "Exploitation of race conditions during routine management",
         "Malformed database configuration."
