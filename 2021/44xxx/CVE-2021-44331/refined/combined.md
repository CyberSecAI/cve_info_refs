| Fails on 2.x and main (different failure modes).  The `2.x` branch is failing with an assertion in debug builds  ``` WARNING: Unable to find encoding within specified error limit  astcenc_symbolic_physical.cpp:130: void symbolic_to_physical(const block_size_descriptor &, const symbolic_compressed_block &, physical_compressed_block &): Assertion `packed_index >= 0 && packed_index < bsd.block_mode_count' failed.  ```  Looks like `main` is failing with the same root cause, but fails with some level of stack corruption before it gets as far as the assert.  Current hypothesis is that we are trying to use invalid symbolic values, which are out of range for some array accesses. |

| The bug here is that complex blocks may fail to generate a valid encoding, so the final block is actually an otherwise unpopulated symbolic block in the error state. The current `symbolic_to_physical()` function doesn't handle this.  This issue has been in the code forever, but it's more likely that valid encodings are not found due to the reduction in search space covered by the optimized compressor. |

| The temporary workaround is to replace error blocks with a constant color block, e.g. copying the origin color. We can probably do better here, but I'll raise a separate issue for this. |
