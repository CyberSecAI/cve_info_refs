Based on the provided content, here's an analysis:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a SQL injection vulnerability in the `AdvertController.class.php` file of the tuzicms application. Specifically, the `id` parameter obtained from the `GET` request is directly incorporated into a SQL query without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is the lack of input sanitization when handling the `id` parameter from the GET request. The application uses `$id=I('get.id');` to retrieve the value and directly inject it into the SQL query. This allows for arbitrary SQL code injection by a malicious user.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized database access: An attacker can use this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive data stored in the database, such as user credentials, configuration information, or other confidential records.
- Data manipulation: An attacker could use the SQL injection to modify or delete data in the database.
- Privilege escalation: In some cases, SQL injection can lead to privilege escalation allowing the attacker to perform administrative tasks on the database.
- Information disclosure: The attacker can extract user names, database details or other information.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request: The attack vector is through an HTTP GET request where the vulnerable parameter `id` is located in the URL parameters.
- Crafted SQL payload: The attacker crafts a SQL payload, for instance using `AND` and functions like `extractvalue()` or `select user()` that is passed through the `id` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the application: An attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the server hosting the vulnerable tuzicms application.
- Basic understanding of SQL: The attacker should have some knowledge of SQL syntax to craft a successful SQL injection payload.

**Technical Details:**

The specific vulnerable code snippet is:
```php
public function index() {
  //查询指定id的栏目信息
  $id=I('get.id');//类别ID
  $topnav=M('Adnav')->where("id=$id")->select();
}
```
The provided Proof of Concept (POC) is:
`<http://127.0.0.1/index.php/Advert/Index/Adnav?id=1%20and%20(extractvalue(1,concat(0x7e,(select%20user()),0x7e)))>`

This POC shows how the attacker can inject SQL code through the `id` parameter. The `extractvalue()` function is used here as a means of extracting information.
