- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The JTTK library is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write when parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening a maliciously crafted JT file using a vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious JT file.
