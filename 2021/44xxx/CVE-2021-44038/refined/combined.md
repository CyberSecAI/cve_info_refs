## Find the package that you need to work with

The build service contains many different versions of packages. Some may be
official releases and others may be under development by users in their home
projects. The easiest way to find which versions are candidates for
maintenance, use the osc maintained command. We'll use the
nfs-utils package as an example.

````
$ osc maintained nfs-utils
openSUSE:Leap:15.1:Update/nfs-utils

````
## Create a branch

The build service provides an easy way to work on packages without having to unnecessarily contaminate the original package. It allows the user to check out a private version of the package into their home project. Any changes committed to it will be stored as a set of changes to the original. This has the advantage of making the differences between the two projects obvious when the branch is eventually submitted back to the original project.

The process for creating a branch of a single package from a single project is:

````
$ osc branch -M -c openSUSE:Leap:42.3 nfs-utils
[...]

````

In this case an update for nfs-utils was released previously already. The
updated sources got stored in a different project, *openSUSE:Leap:42.3:Update*.
You don't have to bother about that detail. osc automatically does the right
thing and uses the updated sources. So just follow the instructions provided
and check out your branched copy of the package:

If you already have a branch for this package, you should remove and recreate it. A branch that is still around and you wonder why needs investigation. It may mean that a submit-request was not accepted, and thus the cleanup never triggered. Removing such a branch may destroy your previous work.

The branch point exists from the point in time that you created it. If other changes have been committed in the interim, they will be lost if you use your existing branch. You can delete the branch by deleting the package with the osc rdelete *project package* command. For our example, it would be osc rdelete home:BenniBrunner:branches:openSUSE:Leap:42.3:Update nfs-utils.openSUSE\_Leap\_42.3\_Update.

### Branching all code streams at once

Sometimes you need to update a package for all maintained code streams, e.g. for a
security fix. With the method described above you'd have to branch and check
out the package two times, once for Leap 42.2 and Leap 42.3.

The osc mbranch command will make that convenient. It can query the build service to find the list of projects where a package is flagged for maintenance.

![Icon-warning.png](/images/3/3b/Icon-warning.png)
**Warning:** This relies on correct configuration within the build service. Please consult with the maintenance team, if you suspect the list of projects used by osc mbranch is incorrect.

osc mbranch collects all copies of the package from all projects flagged for maintenance and creates branches of those packages in one project:

````
$ osc mbranch nfs-utils
Project home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils created.

````

````
$ osc co home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils
A    home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils
A    home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils/nfs-utils.openSUSE_Leap_42.2_Update
[...]
A    home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils/nfs-utils.openSUSE_Leap_42.3_Update
[...]

````
![Icon-warning.png](/images/3/3b/Icon-warning.png)
**Warning:** If you have multiple spec files in your package, please use osc ls home:*username*:branches:OBS\_Maintained:*packagename* to double-check that packages were created for all spec-files.
### Adding a new codestream

osc mbranch has no way of adding new code streams to a maintenance project. Instead, you can use osc branch's -M parameter.

````
 osc branch -M openSUSE:Leap:15.5:Update nfs-utils home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils

````

This will link the package to the Leap 15 Update repository, name the package correctly (i.e. append the name of the code stream), and add the necessary repository in the project config.

Now, you can run osc up in the maintenance project directory to check out the newly created code stream package.

### Getting the list of maintained copies manually

If still in doubt, please contact the maintenance team for the correct list.

## Make your changes

Now that you have a private copy of the package, you can make whatever changes you need to the package. The easiest way to handle updating the file list is to ensure that you don't have any temporary files still in the source package directory and use the osc addremove command.

If you add new patches, make sure to follow the [Patch tagging guidelines](/openSUSE%3APackaging_Patches_guidelines "openSUSE:Packaging Patches guidelines").

Once you've completed your changes, add an entry to the .changes files using
osc vc.

* briefly describe the problem, one line per problem
* include a reference to the bug number in the form (bnc#12345) (if you have a bug, it must be included)
* for security fixes include the CVE number if available.

Finally commit your changes to your branch with the osc commit command.

See  [HOWTO write good changes](/openSUSE%3AHowto_write_good_changes "openSUSE:Howto write good changes")

## Submit your changes

Your branch is now a separate package and will build independently in your home project. It's generally a good idea to ensure that it builds within the tight constraints of the build system and is tested properly before submitting it. The submit process is simple.

From your checked-out project directory:

````
$ osc mr
created request id 22864

````

All packages from a remote-project:

````
$ osc mr $prj
created request id 22864

````

A specific package from a remote-project:

````
$ osc mr $prj $pkg $target #(e.g. $target could be openSUSE:Leap:15.5:Update)
created request id 22864

````

A sub-set of packages from a remote-project:

````
 $osc mr $prj $list $of $packages $target
 created request id 22864

````

Osc will prompt you for a message for the submit request. Usually
you just use the same message as for the .changes file.

![Icon-warning.png](/images/3/3b/Icon-warning.png)
**Warning:** Please check the created request ID for acceptance or declines. Especially the automatic bot reviews might be buggy sometimes.

If the above doesn't work, you can try, from the checked-out package directory:

````
$ osc sr
WARNING:
WARNING: Project does not accept submit request, request to open a NEW maintenance incident instead
WARNING:
created request id Request: #180441

````
## Update the Bugzilla state

Once your submission is done and your packages build successful, please adjust the Bugzilla entry.

If the bug is security (starting with VUL- in the subject):

* reassign to security-team@suse.de once you think everything is done.

If the bug is anything else

* mark as RESOLVED/FIXED once you have submitted your fixes.

# FRRouting Project

FRRouting (FRR) is a free and open source Internet routing protocol suite for
Linux and Unix platforms. It implements BGP, OSPF, RIP, IS-IS, PIM, LDP, BFD,
Babel, PBR, OpenFabric and VRRP, with alpha support for EIGRP and NHRP.

FRR’s seamless integration with native Linux/Unix IP networking stacks makes it
a general purpose routing stack applicable to a wide variety of use cases
including connecting hosts/VMs/containers to the network, advertising network
services, LAN switching and routing, Internet access routers, and Internet
peering.

FRR has its roots in the Quagga project. In fact, it was started by many
long-time Quagga developers who combined their efforts to improve on Quagga’s
well-established foundation in order to create the best routing protocol stack
available. We invite you to participate in the FRRouting community and help
shape the future of networking.

Join the ranks of network architects using FRR for ISPs, SaaS infrastructure,
web 2.0 businesses, hyperscale services, and Fortune 500 private clouds.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1191890#c0)  Johannes Segitz   2021-10-21 08:06:14 UTC  ``` Quagga has serveral local privilege escalations (LPE) from the runtime user to root. openSUSE is affected, but package is broken so it's currently only a minor threat. SLES not affected.  Vector 1: service files run chown/chmod in user owned directory. introduced upstream with commit 9d035625fe5aa648d4bece430df24bcd2c04c2f2 e.g. isisd.service  13 ExecStartPre=-/bin/chmod -f 640 /etc/quagga/isisd.conf  14 ExecStartPre=-/bin/chown -f $QUAGGA_USER:$QUAGGA_GROUP /etc/quagga/isisd.conf  /etc/quagga belongs to $quagga_user, so usually quagga. By creating a symlink to another file (e.g. /etc/passwd) quagga can become the owner of this file. Since the openSUSE package currently is broken since the $QUAGGA_USER:$QUAGGA_GROUP is not set only the chmod works.  Vector 2: Introduced upstream with commit a5efdb60905049e1224a020b78dd9699bdd15b29, although one chown was already there before.  Doens't affect us at all since we don't have it. Here for completeness and to make the maintainer aware.  The suggested spec file has (redhat/quagga.spec.in): 386 %if 0%{?quagga_user:1} 387         chown %quagga_user:%quagga_user %{_sysconfdir}/zebra.conf* 388 %endif 389         chmod 640 %{_sysconfdir}/zebra.conf 390 fi 391 for daemon in %{all_daemons} ; do 392         if [ ! -e %{_sysconfdir}/${daemon}.conf ]; then 393                 touch %{_sysconfdir}/${daemon}.conf 394                 %if 0%{?quagga_user:1} 395                         chown %quagga_user:%quagga_user %{_sysconfdir}/${daemon}.conf* 396                 %endif 397         fi 398 done so it's vulnerable to the same issues  I'm currently trying to get in touch with upstream, but the project seems dead. I'll request a CVE for this once I clarified that with them ``` [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1191890#c1)  Johannes Segitz   2021-10-21 08:07:43 UTC  ``` This is an embargoed bug. This means that this information is not public.  Please do NOT: - talk to other people about this unless they're involved in fixing the issue - make this bug public - submit this into OBS (e.g. fix Leap/Tumbleweed) until this bug becomes public (e.g. no EMBARGOED tag on the header)  Your primary responsibility is to develop a fix for this issue. Here is some guidance on openSUSE package maintenance: - [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Package_maintenance](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3APackage_maintenance) - [https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE:Maintenance_update_process](https://en.opensuse.org/openSUSE%3AMaintenance_update_process)  You need to submit AFTER the bug became public, to the current openSUSE Leap codestreams, and to the devel project of your package.  The security team will then take the following steps: - We wait for your submission and package them into an incident for QA testing. The QA tester might reach out to you if they find issues with the update. - If QA doesn't find any issues, we publish the updates.

I'll request a CVE for this once I clarified that with them  Yes, IMO quagga is more or less dead since the frr fork/follow-up happened (quagga 1.1 -> frr 2.0) and where most of the developers moved.

We've added frr pkg to SLE-15-SP3 (<https://jira.suse.com/browse/SLE-15017>) instead to update quagga (quagga 1.2 were also marked experimental...)  Once we've addressed vector 1 in factory, maybe a drop request for factory would be an option? ``` [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=1191890#c3)  Johannes Segitz   2021-11-17 13:02:15 UTC  ``` yes, that sounds like a plan.

A brown paper release, to fix an error causing asserts in daemons. See <https://bugzilla.quagga.net/show_bug.cgi?id=975>. With thanks to Sergey Popov, Andreas Nilsson and Xiami.

Summary of changes:

lib: Fix assert in thread\_add\_unuse if thread\_execute was used lib: Avoid re-definition of IPPROTO\_IP with some versions of Linux

Full changelog:

commit [9d7a49f](https://github.com/Quagga/quagga/commit/9d7a49f6090b6106ee9ecad4687167b2e60d98c3) Author: Paul Jakma paul@jakma.org Date: Mon Feb 19 20:55:20 2018 +0000

lib: Fix assert in thread\_add\_unuse if thread\_execute was used

* thread.c: (thread\_call) thread\_execute passes in a dummy thread, on its

  stack, with a NULL thread master. Those shouldn't be added to the unuse

  list or thread\_add\_unuse rightly asserts.

  Fix this very dumb bug.

  See <https://bugzilla.quagga.net/show_bug.cgi?id=975>

  With thanks to Sergey Popov, admin@pinkbyte.ru, and Andreas Nilsson,

  andrnils@resilans.se, for help with diagnosis and testing.

  commit [fed5021](https://github.com/Quagga/quagga/commit/fed50218deeaef4d996d25c45b1aa56fe5e337c4) Author: Xiami taopy@vip.qq.com Date: Sun Feb 4 16:35:42 2018 +0000

lib: Avoid re-definition of IPPROTO\_IP with some versions of Linux

* Starting from linux-4.11 [commit

  bcb41c6bced1ee778d23c53a6b4807fb08cf5540], linux/mroute.h includes

  linux/in.h , that makes gcc roar a lot of things like "error:

  redeclaration of enumerator 'IPPROTO\_IP'" when compiling quagga-1.2.2

  lib/zebra.h includes sys/capability.h first, then includes

  netinet/in.h . In sys/capability.h, it includes linux/xattr.h, and

  that includes linux/libc-compat.h . Since at that time netinet/in.h is

  not included yet, \_NETINET\_IN\_H is not defined, causing libc-compat.h

  set \_\_UAPI\_DEF\_IN\_IPPROTO to 1. Then, a include of netinet/in.h

  defines IPPROTO\_IP. Later a include of linux/mroute.h includes

  linux/in.h. Because \_\_UAPI\_DEF\_IN\_IPPROTO is set to non zero,

  IPPROTO\_IP is redeclared.
* lib/zebra.h: Move the privs/capabilities include block to after the

  network block.

## Find the package that you need to work with

The build service contains many different versions of packages. Some may be
official releases and others may be under development by users in their home
projects. The easiest way to find which versions are candidates for
maintenance, use the osc maintained command. We'll use the
nfs-utils package as an example.

````
$ osc maintained nfs-utils
openSUSE:Leap:15.1:Update/nfs-utils

````
## Create a branch

The build service provides an easy way to work on packages without having to unnecessarily contaminate the original package. It allows the user to check out a private version of the package into their home project. Any changes committed to it will be stored as a set of changes to the original. This has the advantage of making the differences between the two projects obvious when the branch is eventually submitted back to the original project.

The process for creating a branch of a single package from a single project is:

````
$ osc branch -M -c openSUSE:Leap:42.3 nfs-utils
[...]

````

In this case an update for nfs-utils was released previously already. The
updated sources got stored in a different project, *openSUSE:Leap:42.3:Update*.
You don't have to bother about that detail. osc automatically does the right
thing and uses the updated sources. So just follow the instructions provided
and check out your branched copy of the package:

If you already have a branch for this package, you should remove and recreate it. A branch that is still around and you wonder why needs investigation. It may mean that a submit-request was not accepted, and thus the cleanup never triggered. Removing such a branch may destroy your previous work.

The branch point exists from the point in time that you created it. If other changes have been committed in the interim, they will be lost if you use your existing branch. You can delete the branch by deleting the package with the osc rdelete *project package* command. For our example, it would be osc rdelete home:BenniBrunner:branches:openSUSE:Leap:42.3:Update nfs-utils.openSUSE\_Leap\_42.3\_Update.

### Branching all code streams at once

Sometimes you need to update a package for all maintained code streams, e.g. for a
security fix. With the method described above you'd have to branch and check
out the package two times, once for Leap 42.2 and Leap 42.3.

The osc mbranch command will make that convenient. It can query the build service to find the list of projects where a package is flagged for maintenance.

![Icon-warning.png](/images/3/3b/Icon-warning.png)
**Warning:** This relies on correct configuration within the build service. Please consult with the maintenance team, if you suspect the list of projects used by osc mbranch is incorrect.

osc mbranch collects all copies of the package from all projects flagged for maintenance and creates branches of those packages in one project:

````
$ osc mbranch nfs-utils
Project home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils created.

````

````
$ osc co home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils
A    home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils
A    home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils/nfs-utils.openSUSE_Leap_42.2_Update
[...]
A    home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils/nfs-utils.openSUSE_Leap_42.3_Update
[...]

````
![Icon-warning.png](/images/3/3b/Icon-warning.png)
**Warning:** If you have multiple spec files in your package, please use osc ls home:*username*:branches:OBS\_Maintained:*packagename* to double-check that packages were created for all spec-files.
### Adding a new codestream

osc mbranch has no way of adding new code streams to a maintenance project. Instead, you can use osc branch's -M parameter.

````
 osc branch -M openSUSE:Leap:15.5:Update nfs-utils home:BenniBrunner:branches:OBS_Maintained:nfs-utils

````

This will link the package to the Leap 15 Update repository, name the package correctly (i.e. append the name of the code stream), and add the necessary repository in the project config.

Now, you can run osc up in the maintenance project directory to check out the newly created code stream package.

### Getting the list of maintained copies manually

If still in doubt, please contact the maintenance team for the correct list.

## Make your changes

Now that you have a private copy of the package, you can make whatever changes you need to the package. The easiest way to handle updating the file list is to ensure that you don't have any temporary files still in the source package directory and use the osc addremove command.

If you add new patches, make sure to follow the [Patch tagging guidelines](/openSUSE%3APackaging_Patches_guidelines "openSUSE:Packaging Patches guidelines").

Once you've completed your changes, add an entry to the .changes files using
osc vc.

* briefly describe the problem, one line per problem
* include a reference to the bug number in the form (bnc#12345) (if you have a bug, it must be included)
* for security fixes include the CVE number if available.

Finally commit your changes to your branch with the osc commit command.

See  [HOWTO write good changes](/openSUSE%3AHowto_write_good_changes "openSUSE:Howto write good changes")

## Submit your changes

Your branch is now a separate package and will build independently in your home project. It's generally a good idea to ensure that it builds within the tight constraints of the build system and is tested properly before submitting it. The submit process is simple.

From your checked-out project directory:

````
$ osc mr
created request id 22864

````

All packages from a remote-project:

````
$ osc mr $prj
created request id 22864

````

A specific package from a remote-project:

````
$ osc mr $prj $pkg $target #(e.g. $target could be openSUSE:Leap:15.5:Update)
created request id 22864

````

A sub-set of packages from a remote-project:

````
 $osc mr $prj $list $of $packages $target
 created request id 22864

````

Osc will prompt you for a message for the submit request. Usually
you just use the same message as for the .changes file.

![Icon-warning.png](/images/3/3b/Icon-warning.png)
**Warning:** Please check the created request ID for acceptance or declines. Especially the automatic bot reviews might be buggy sometimes.

If the above doesn't work, you can try, from the checked-out package directory:

````
$ osc sr
WARNING:
WARNING: Project does not accept submit request, request to open a NEW maintenance incident instead
WARNING:
created request id Request: #180441

````
## Update the Bugzilla state

Once your submission is done and your packages build successful, please adjust the Bugzilla entry.

If the bug is security (starting with VUL- in the subject):

* reassign to security-team@suse.de once you think everything is done.

If the bug is anything else

* mark as RESOLVED/FIXED once you have submitted your fixes.

1. Request 1036299

##### Overview

### Request 1036299 accepted

Quagga has not been developed further since 2018.

The last submission (https://build.opensuse.org/request/show/1035188)

fixed a security issue introduced by the factory-only 1.2 version and

contained a changes entry and an update-message to migrate to FRR:

https://frrouting.org/

FRR has its roots in the Quagga project. In fact, it was started by many

long-time Quagga developers who combined their efforts to improve on Quagga’s

well-established foundation in order to create the best routing protocol stack

available. We invite you to participate in the FRRouting community and help

shape the future of networking.

The frr package is available since SLE 15-SP3 and openSUSE Leap 15.3.

## Overview

Knowing the process behind a maintenance release allows to understand the importance of the steps of the process and should help with submitting packages that can be quickly pushed through the process.

The following flow-chart diagram illustrates the maintenance package update process. It includes several different OBS projects:
[![Maintenance update process.png](/images/4/44/Maintenance_update_process.png)](/File%3AMaintenance_update_process.png)

Let's look a bit closer at some of the steps:

## Check if a Leap package is inherited from SLE

Some packages from openSUSE Leap are shared with SLE. Those packages are automatically merged after the SLE-update is released.
To check if your package is inherited you can look in the following package:

**openSUSE Leap 15.5:**

openSUSE Leap 15.5 has 4 seperate updates sources.

* OSS repo (openSUSE:Leap:15.5:Update): largely branding and config packages only
* Non-OSS repo (openSUSE:Leap:15.5:Update:NonFree): non-free but redistributable packages like Opera
* Backports repo (openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP5:Update): all non SLE packages in openSUSE Leap 15.5
* SLE repo (via download.opensuse.org/update/leap/15.5/sle/): all SLE imported binary packages for openSUSE Leap 15.5

How to find out:

`osc sm PACKAGE`

If the package comes from openSUSE:Leap:15.5:Update or openSUSE:Backports:SLE-15-SP5:Update , submit to these ones. The openSUSE Maintenance team will process it.

If there is a SUSE:SLE-15:Update entry (or 15-SP1 , 15-SP2 or 15-SP3), submit it there. It will be mirrored into the SUSE Internal Buildservice and processed there. (NOTE: If you are a SUSE employee, please directly submit in the IBS to the listed project, this avoids the mirroring step.)

## Write a meaningful changelog-entry

For the [maintenance team](/openSUSE%3AMaintenance_team "openSUSE:Maintenance team") it's important, that a meaningful changelog-entry is provided to prepare the patch-documentation and rating. For a detailed description, please refer to the [patches guideline](/openSUSE%3APackaging_Patches_guidelines "openSUSE:Packaging Patches guidelines"), but here is a list of the most important information:

* Bug reference (boo#123456, CVE-2016-1234,...)
* short description for the fix
* Added/modified/dropped patchnames

## Open a maintenance request

After the package is ready to submit, you need to open a maintenance-request. You can achieve this with the following commands:

**One package for one openSUSE release:**

```
 $osc mr $prj $pkg $release_target

```

**Several packages for one openSUSE release:**

```
 $osc mr $prj $list $of $packages $release_target

```

**Several packages for several openSUSE releases:**

(This only works if your packages are in one project and the packages were branched with '$osc mbranch $pkg' or '$osc branch -M $prj $pkg')

```
 $osc mr $prj

```
## Maintenance team review

The [maintenance team](/openSUSE%3AMaintenance_team "openSUSE:Maintenance team") decides whether an update will be released. They authorize the initiation of the maintenance process and start the ball rolling. They interact directly with the packager to coordinate the submission of the package that contains the fix. They ensure that the bugs being fixed are what are actually being put into the maintenance update. The decision making process is outlined in more detail below.

## Source Review

The [openSUSE review team](/openSUSE%3AOpenSUSE_review_team "openSUSE:OpenSUSE review team") does a manual review of the submission following [these guidelines](/openSUSE%3AFactory_review "openSUSE:Factory review"). Those of the review team who intend to review the maintenance submissions will find the SRs in each project's "Update" sub-project. For example, to review the submissions for openSUSE Leap 15.1, the reviewer would find the submissions in the "openSUSE:Leap:15.1:Update" project. (In reference to the graph above, note the differences between the "openSUSE:Maintenance" project and the "openSUSE:Leap:15.1:Update" project. Reviewers shouldn't be looking in the "openSUSE:Maintenance" project to do their reviews.)

## QA review

openSUSE maintenance updates are tested with openQA and by our community. We are waiting around 5 days, to see if issues are reported, before we release the update.

If you want to test all pending updates, you need to register the following repository:
**openSUSE Leap 15.5:**

```
 <http://download.opensuse.org/update/leap/15.5-test/>

```

(note: this does not include the pending SLE imported updates at this time.)

## Patchinfo

From Leap 15.4 onwards, the part of Leap that comes from SUSE Linux Enterprise is using both patchinfos and dedicated channels. The *channels* are the same tools we use on SUSE Linux Enterprise for filtering and aggregating the binaries built from a source package and that we want to deliver to a specific product.

This change, better consolidated with Leap 15.5, unifies the way to delivery maintenance updates in Leap and SUSE Linux Enterprise.

IBS internal service links:

* [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:Channels/openSUSE-SLE\_15.4](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3AChannels/openSUSE-SLE_15.4)
* [https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE:Channels/openSUSE-SLE\_15.5](https://build.suse.de/package/show/SUSE%3AChannels/openSUSE-SLE_15.5)

Given that Leap is built also with sources not coming from SUSE Linux Enterprise, we have some blocklisting mechanism for filtering out binaries from SUSE Linux Enterprise that are not supposed to land on Leap (like for example branding).

The blocklist is embedded in the perl generator script for updates: (hosted on SUSE internal gitlab).
