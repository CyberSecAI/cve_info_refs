Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-44839:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access controls in the password reset functionality of DeltaRM 1.2. Specifically, the `/listes/DTsendmaildata/adm_utilisateur/send-mail.json` endpoint does not validate the current user's roles and permissions, allowing an authenticated user to request password resets for other users.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* **Broken Access Control:** The primary weakness is the failure to restrict password reset requests to only authorized users. The system allows any authenticated user to trigger password resets for arbitrary user IDs, leading to unauthorized password changes.
* **Insecure API Endpoint:** The `/listes/DTsendmaildata/adm_utilisateur/send-mail.json` endpoint is not properly secured, as it accepts an array of user IDs without any authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Unauthorized Account Access:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to reset the passwords of other user accounts, potentially gaining unauthorized access to those accounts.
* **Denial of Service:** By resetting passwords for multiple users, an attacker could effectively lock legitimate users out of their accounts, causing a denial-of-service.
* **Data Breach:** With access to other accounts, the attacker might be able to access sensitive information or resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
* **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed via a POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/listes/DTsendmaildata/adm_utilisateur/send-mail.json`.
* **JSON Payload:** The request body contains a JSON array of user IDs for whom the passwords need to be reset.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DeltaRM application. This means they must already have a valid user account within the system.
* **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the DeltaRM application server to send the crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint.

**Additional Information:**
* **Affected Product:** DeltaRM 1.2
* **Vendor:** DeltaRM
* **Severity:** High
* **Status:** Fixed
* **Fix:** The vendor implemented access control validations to ensure that users can only reset their own passwords.
* **Disclosure Timeline:** The vulnerability was disclosed to DeltaRM on 2021-10-26 and fixed on 2021-12-11.
