  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Crafted data in a DGN file and lack of proper validation for the XFAT sectors count can trigger a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Out-of-bounds Write",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "To exploit vulnerability malicious DGN file should be read using ODA Drawings SDK.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious DGN file to be opened with the vulnerable software."
