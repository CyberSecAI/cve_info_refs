```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection vulnerability in the login form, specifically within the `username` parameter. Also vulnerable are the `c`, `id`, and `q` parameters in the `/magazines/` node app.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** SQL Injection (SQLi)
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - Authentication bypass to the admin panel.
  - Ability for the attacker to potentially gain full control of the vulnerable system, including administrator and other user accounts.
  - The attacker can also potentially exfiltrate sensitive information by utilizing `load_file()`.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - HTTP POST request to `/magazines/classes/Login.php?f=login` with malicious SQL injection payload in the `username` parameter.
  - HTTP GET requests to the `/magazines/` node app with malicious SQL injection payloads in the `c`, `id`, and `q` parameters.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
    - No prior authentication is needed, since it's an authentication bypass.
