### What is Slic3r?

### The Slic3r desktop app

* Turn your 3D models into G-code
* Visual preview of toolpaths
* Advanced configuration management
* Custom G-code with conditional logic
* Print spool queue (print on multiple machines simultaneously) or send to OctoPrint
* FDM/FFF and SLA/DLP
* modifiers (distinct settings on custom regions)
* ...and much more

### The command line tool

Most features are exposed from command line, thus providing a handy tool for batch operations and custom integrations:

* Generate G-code in batch form
* Export SVG slices
* Cut, transform, repair 3D models
* Convert between 3D formats

### libslic3r

A C++ library for building custom applications on top of the Slic3r internal algorithms:

* Handle 3D models (open, repair, transform, convert)
* Slice to vector data
* Generate G-code in many flavors
* Generate infill patterns
* Send G-code over serial port
* Estimate G-code printing time

### Features

**Compatible with your printer too.**
RepRap (Prusa Mendel, MendelMax, Huxley, Tantillus...), Ultimaker, Makerbot, Lulzbot AO-100, TAZ, MakerGear M2, Rostock, Mach3, Bukobot and lots more. And even DLP printers.

**Fast G-code generation is fast.**
Don't wait hours for slicing that detailed model. Slic3r is about 100x faster than Skeinforge. It also uses multithreading for parallel computation.

**Lots of input/output formats.**
Slic3r reads STL, AMF and OBJ files while it can output G-code and SVG files.

**Do you like the graphical interface or command line?**
All the features of the user-friendly interface are also available from command line. This allows to integrate Slic3r in your custom toolchain and batch operations as you like.

**Open source, open development.**
Slic3r is open source software, licenced under the AGPLv3 license. The development is centered on GitHub and the #slic3r IRC channel on FreeNode, where the community is highly involved in testing and providing ideas and feedback.

**Dependencies? Nah.**
Slic3r is super-easy to run: download, double click and enjoy. No dependencies needed. Hassle-free. For MacOS X, Windows, Linux.

**Print with dual multiple extruders.**
Print beautiful colored objects, or use your secondary extruder to build support material. Or put a larger nozzle on it and print a faster infill.

**Use brim for the best adhesion.**
This unique feature improves built plate adhesion by generating a base flange around your objects that you can easily remove after printing.

**Microlayering: save time, increase accuracy.**
You can choose to print a thicker infill to benefit from low layer heights on perimeters and still keep your print time within a reasonable amount.

**Compose a plate but print one object at time.**
Use the built-in plating interface that allows to place objects with drag-and-drop, rotate and scale them, arrange everything as you like. The *sequential printing* feature allows to print one complete object at time in a single print job.

**Cool cooling strategies.**
A very smart cooling logic will regulate your fan speed and print speed to ensure each layer has enough time to cool down before next one is laid on it.

**Manage multiple printers, filaments and build styles.**
The configuration handling system was designed for people working with multiple machines and filaments: you can save configurations as presets for each category avoiding to multiply your saved configurations.

**Enjoy support material.**
Automatic generation of support material for overhangs.

# Slic3r libslic3r STL File GCode::extrude() out-of-bounds read vulnerability
### CVE Number
CVE-2021-44962
### Summary
An out-of-bounds read vulnerability exists in the GCode::extrude() functionality of Slic3r libslic3r 1.3.0 and Master Commit b1a5500. A specially crafted stl file could lead to information disclosure. An attacker can provide a malicious file to trigger this vulnerability.
### Tested Versions
Slic3r libslic3r 1.3.0
Slic3r libslic3r Master Commit b1a5500
### Tested Environment
Ubuntu 16.04.7 LTS (GNU/Linux 4.15.0-142-generic x86\_64)
### Product URLs
https://slic3r.org/
### Details
When reading in an `.stl` file with the `--export-gcode` argument, the `GCode::extrude()` function tries to access the second to last element of `paths.back().polyline.points` on line 430 in the file `GCode.cpp`.
```cpp=425
// make a little move inwards before leaving loop
if (paths.back().role == erExternalPerimeter && this->layer != NULL && this->config.perimeters > 1) {
// detect angle between last and first segment
// the side depends on the original winding order of the polygon (left for contours, right for holes)
Point a = paths.front().polyline.points[1]; // second point
Point b = \*(paths.back().polyline.points.end()-3); // second to last point
if (was\_clockwise) {
// swap points
Point c = a; a = b; b = c;
}
double angle = paths.front().first\_point().ccw\_angle(a, b) / 3;
// turn left if contour, turn right if hole
if (was\_clockwise) angle \*= -1;
[...]
```
Following the chain of member and element accesses, we find that `paths` is a vector of `class ExtrusionPath`, namely `std::vector<ExtrusionPath>`. Each of the vector elements has a public member `Polyline polyline`, which in turn stores a vector of `class Point`, `std::vector<Point>`.
```cpp=62
class ExtrusionPath : public ExtrusionEntity
{
public:
Polyline polyline;
ExtrusionRole role;
/// Volumetric velocity. mm^3 of plastic per mm of linear head motion
double mm3\_per\_mm;
/// Width of the extrusion.
float width;
/// Height of the extrusion.
float height;
[...]
```
Though by definition, a polyline should consist of more than 2 points, the vlnerability is triggered because for some input `.stl` files, the length of `std::vector<Point>` may be equal to or less than 2. Therefore, this vulnerability can cause an unexpected access on heap, leading to potential information leakage.
