The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44302.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `/user/ztconfig.php` file of BaiCloud-cms version 2.5.7. The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability is present in the `/user/ztconfig.php` file.
- Unsanitized user input is used in the SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL queries, which could allow them to:
    - Extract sensitive information from the database (e.g., user credentials, system configurations)
    - Modify data in the database, potentially causing data corruption or unauthorized changes.
    - Potentially gain full control of the database server or underlying operating system

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited through HTTP POST requests to `/user/ztconfig.php`.
- The attacker needs to manipulate the `tongji` and `baidu_map` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user.
- They need the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
