- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is triggered while parsing specially crafted JT files. Specifically, the JTTK library is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds read past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read vulnerability (CWE-125)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to leak information in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L). A user must be tricked into opening a malicious JT file (User interaction is required - UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a specially crafted JT file to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required (PR:N).
