Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-44049

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way CyberArk Endpoint Privilege Manager (EPM) handles the "Get Support Info" functionality, specifically when a user selects "Process Monitor recording session". The EPM agent launches the "Procmon" tool (Process Monitor) to monitor running processes.  The core issue is that `Procmon.exe` launches `Procmon64.exe` with elevated privileges from the user's temp directory, and this `Procmon64.exe` is not properly validated via a checksum.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Insecure Execution Path:** The Procmon tool (specifically `Procmon64.exe`) is launched from the user's temporary directory, a location that is user-writable. This is a security risk.
*   **Missing Integrity Check:**  The `Procmon64.exe` binary is not validated by a checksum or similar mechanism.
*   **Unnecessary Elevated Privileges:** `Procmon64.exe` runs with elevated privileges. This can result in privilege escalation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Local Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can replace the legitimate `Procmon64.exe` binary with a malicious executable (like `cmd.exe`). When the user starts a Process Monitoring session, the malicious executable will run with elevated privileges, granting the attacker system-level control.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker gains the ability to execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target system with a low-privileged user account.
*   **EPM Support Mode Enabled:** The "Support mode" needs to be enabled in EPM by an administrator, allowing the low-privileged user to initiate the process monitor without UAC prompts.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   A user with a low-privileged account on the target Windows system.
*   The user must be able to access and modify files within their temp directory.
*   EPM Support Mode must be enabled.
*   The attacker must be able to replace the `Procmon64.exe` file with a malicious binary before the "Process Monitor recording session" is started.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability affects all versions of CyberArk EPM before the fix was released.
*   The fix for the vulnerability was released on 20.12.2021.
*   Cloud customers received the fix automatically from CyberArk. On-premise customers had to manually update their software to apply the fix.
* The initial attempt to replace `Procmon.exe` failed because of a checksum validation, which lead to the attacker discovering the `Procmon64.exe` binary.
