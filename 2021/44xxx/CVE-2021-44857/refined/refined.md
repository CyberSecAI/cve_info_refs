Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44857:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The `mcrundo` and `mcrrestore` actions in MediaWiki did not properly check for editing permissions before allowing users to revert to an older revision. This allowed an attacker to take content from any arbitrary revision and save it on any page of their choosing, without needing edit rights on the target page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authorization Check:** The primary weakness was the lack of permission checks for the `mcrundo` and `mcrrestore` actions. These actions should have verified if the user had the necessary rights to edit the target page before allowing the content replacement.
*   **Bypass EditFilterMergedContent:** The vulnerability also allowed bypassing the `EditFilterMergedContent` hook, which is used to enforce edit restrictions and content filtering via extensions like AbuseFilter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Content Manipulation:** Attackers could replace the content of any page with the content of any other revision, regardless of whether they had the edit permissions for that page.
*   **Public/Private Wiki Impact:** This affected both public wikis and public pages on private wikis that used the `$wgWhitelistRead` setting to make certain pages publicly accessible.
*   **Potential for Malicious Content Injection:** While the attacker could not create new revisions without edit rights, they could inject content from existing revisions, potentially causing confusion or enabling further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Manipulation of `action` parameters:** Attackers could exploit this vulnerability by crafting URLs with `action=mcrundo` or `action=mcrrestore`, along with the necessary parameters to specify the source revision and the target page.
*   **Publicly Accessible Pages:** For private wikis, the attack was limited to pages exposed through `$wgWhitelistRead`, enabling attacks by logged-out users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Web Access:** An attacker only needed to be able to access the MediaWiki instance through a web browser. No authentication was needed to exploit this if the target page was accessible via `$wgWhitelistRead` or if the wiki was public.
*   **Knowledge of Revision IDs:** The attacker needed to know the IDs of the revisions they wanted to use as the source of the content.
*   **No Editing Permissions Needed:** The vulnerability allowed attackers to modify pages even without having editing permissions on those specific pages.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix implemented for this vulnerability involved adding checks to verify that the user has the appropriate 'edit' rights via `authorizeWrite` before allowing the `mcrundo` and `mcrrestore` actions to proceed.
*   The issue also involved another vulnerability related to the `undo` feature (`action=edit&undo=##&undoafter=###`), which also lacked a check to verify the revisions belonged to the same page, leading to unauthorized access to revisions. However, that specific issue is identified as CVE-2021-44858.
* The provided text notes this vulnerability was fixed in MediaWiki versions 1.35.5, 1.36.3, and 1.37.1.
