{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Multiple driver components within MSI Center Pro are vulnerable to privilege escalation due to insecure handling of IOCTL requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Direct interaction with physical memory via the `MmMapIoSpace` function call, allowing mapping of physical memory into user-space virtual addresses.",
      "Read/write access to Model-Specific Registers (MSRs) via the `__readmsr/__writemsr` function calls.",
      "Read/write access to IO ports using 1/2/4 byte operations."
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities to achieve local privilege escalation from low-privileged users to `NT AUTHORITY\\SYSTEM`.",
    "attack_vector": "Sending specific IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver components.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable drivers. Local access is required."
