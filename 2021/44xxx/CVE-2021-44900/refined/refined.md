Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-44900:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause lies within the `NTIOLib_X64.sys` driver component of the MSI App Player. This driver has vulnerabilities related to handling IOCTL requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The driver allows direct interaction with physical memory through the `MmMapIoSpace` function. This allows mapping of physical memory into a virtual address in user space.
- The driver permits reading and writing to Model-Specific Registers (MSRs) using the `__readmsr` and `__writemsr` functions calls.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of these vulnerabilities leads to local privilege escalation from low-privileged users to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves sending specific, crafted IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to have local access to the system where the vulnerable MSI App Player is installed.
- They require the ability to send IOCTL requests to the driver.
