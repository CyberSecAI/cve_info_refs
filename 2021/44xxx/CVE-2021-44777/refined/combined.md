How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

Hi,
I enjoyed your plugin but today Worldfence security plugin warned me about the plugin having critical security issue and advised me to remove it. I hope you can look into this matter when you have time.
Thanks very much for your work.

Really does the job well but you soon realize it is lacking two important pieces to be worth a paid product
1. Compose email has no means to target wordpress subscribers or groups. The TO: box has to be filled in with email,email,emailâ¦ Would be really nice if you could just select all regsitered wordpress users by profile (subscribers). Even better if this would integrate with UAM and other membership plugins.
2. Reporting per email batch would be nice. For example send 2 bulk emails there is no way to get sent/read stats rollups for each to see how successful each campaign was. This is really a crucial feature. At the very least a EXPORT button to able you to export the log to excel so you can do your own stats rollups would be very useful.

it is great, and the author will use other letters to replace the word âtrackâ in the recode link. so that Email receivers will not feel âah, you are watching meâ
