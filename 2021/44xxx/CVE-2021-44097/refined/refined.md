Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability present in the `addMessage.php` file of the "Contact-Form-With-Messages-Entry-Management" application. This occurs because the application doesn't properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the lack of input sanitization. Specifically, the `firstname` parameter is directly used in a database query without proper escaping or parameterization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can exploit the SQL injection to extract sensitive data from the database, including user information, personal details, financial transactions, and session tokens.
*   **Data Manipulation/Deletion:** Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
*  **Confidentiality breach**: The dumped data can further lead to tampering with the confidentiality of the users' personal, transaction details, financial information and various session tokens, etc.
*   **Financial Loss:** The exposure of sensitive data and potential disruption of services can lead to financial losses for the organization.
*   **Complete compromise of the application's database**: As indicated by the Github report, the attacker can use SQLMap to dump the entire database

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted HTTP POST request to `addMessage.php`.
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `firstname` parameter is the vulnerable injection point. By injecting malicious SQL code into the `firstname` parameter, an attacker can influence database queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the application.
*   **Knowledge of SQLi:** The attacker should have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques to craft a malicious payload.
*   **Web Application Knowledge:**  Understanding how the form parameters are used and how they're processed by the application's backend is useful.
*   **SQL Injection tools**: It's mentioned that tools like SQLmap could be used to exploit this vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided exploit uses the following payload injected into the `firstname` parameter: `'%(select*from(select(sleep(20)))a)%'`. This is used for proof-of-concept to demonstrate the ability to inject and execute SQL commands.
*   The attacker can use tools like "Sqlmap" to automate the exploitation process and extract the database information.
*   The vulnerable application is identified as "Contact-Form-With-Messages-Entry-Management" version 1.0.
* The specific vulnerable file is `addMessage.php`
