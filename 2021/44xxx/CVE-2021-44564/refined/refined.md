Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-44564:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an **unsecured communication channel** used between the Easyconnect administration tool and affected SYNC devices. This lack of security allows unauthorized access to the configuration process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure communication channel:** The primary weakness is the lack of encryption or proper authentication in the communication channel used for device configuration.
*   **Configuration Download:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to download the device's configuration file.
*  **Configuration Upload:**  The vulnerability allows an attacker to upload a modified configuration file back to the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Compromise:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 10.0, indicating a critical severity.
*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Attackers can download the configuration file, potentially exposing sensitive information.
*   **Integrity Violation:** Attackers can upload a modified configuration file which could lead to device malfunction, data manipulation or allow for further access.
*   **Availability Impact:** Modification of the configuration could disrupt the normal operation of the device leading to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable SYNC device.
*   **IP Address Knowledge:** The attacker must know the IP address of the target SYNC device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be on the same network or have access to the network where the SYNC device is located.
*   The attacker needs to know the IP address of the target device.

**Affected Products:**

*   The vulnerability affects specific subfamilies of SYNC devices running GPC version 4.15.3 and below:
    *   SYNC200 – SYNC221 M1, SYNC241 M1/M2/M4, SYNC261-M1
    *   SYNC2000 - SYNC2000-M1/M2/M4
    *  SYNC2100 - SYNC2101-M1/M2/M6/M7/M8
    *   SYNC2111 - SYNC2111-M2/M3
    *   SYNC3000 – SYNC3000-M1/M2/M3/M4/M12 (Except Device Generation "GEN_C")

**Mitigation:**

*   Kalkitech/ASE provides a patch that secures the administration channel. The patch should be installed using the Easyconnect utility.

**Additional Notes:**

* The previously available CIP DCCP patch is no longer recommended due to newly discovered vulnerabilities in the supporting libraries.
*  The vulnerability was reported through responsible disclosure and is not known to be publicly exploited as of the advisory date.
