Revision: 1.0

Date: 16-AUGUST-2021

SUMMARY

A security vulnerability originally reported in the SYNC2101 product, and applicable to specific
subfamilies of SYNC devices, allows an attacker to download the configuration file used in the device
and apply a modified configuration file back to the device. The attack requires network access to the
SYNC device and knowledge of its IP address. The attack exploits the unsecured communication
channel used between the administration tool Easyconnect and the SYNC device (in the affected
family of SYNC products)

Kalkitech/ASE provides an upgrade patch that secures the administration channel and eliminates this
vulnerability. Not all SYNC devices are vulnerable to this issue. Please see “AFFECTED PRODUCTS”
sections to verify if your SYNC installations are susceptible and require the proposed mitigations to
be applied

SEVERITY

The vulnerability has been assessed using the Common Vulnerability Scoring System v2 and has the
following characteristics CVSS Base Score: 10.0

Impact Subscore: 10.0

Exploitability Subscore: 10.0

CVSS Temporal Score: 8.3

CVSS Environmental Score: NA

Modified Impact Subscore: NA

Overall CVSS Score: 8.3

CVSS V2 Vector: (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:C/I:C/A:C/E:F/RL:OF/RC:C)

The Environmental Impact score has not been calculated since it depends on the deployment
environment. Affected users are recommended to compute the environmental impact according to
the characteristics of their deployment.

VULNERABILITY DETAILS

The vulnerability is caused due to an unsecured communication channel used to configure the
device. The exploit requires network access to the device and knowledge of its IP address.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS

Products: Following product variants running GPC version 4.15.3 and below are affected

SYNC200 – SYNC221 M1, SYNC241 M1/M2/M4, SYNC261-M1

Document: CYB/2021/33631/Advisory

Revision: 1.0

Date: 16-AUGUST-2021

SYNC2100 - SYNC2101-M1/M2/M6/M7/M8

SYNC2111 - SYNC2111-M2/M3

SYNC3000 – SYNC3000-M1/M2/M3/M4/M12– [Note: In this product range, Device Generation –
“GEN_C” specifically is not susceptible to this issue]

NOTE: These products traditionally supported an option (offered to security-sensitive installations)
called the CIP DCCP patch that served to secure the communication channel. However, this option is
NO LONGER recommended due to new vulnerabilities detected in supporting libraries.

MITIGATION OR RESOLUTION

Kalkitech/ASE provides an upgrade patch that can be installed to the affected devices using the
default Easyconnect utility. Application of this patch secures the administration channel and
eliminates this vulnerability.

The patch as well as user instructions are distributed to validated customers through their Kalki.io
accounts. Affected customers who have not activated their Kalki.io device-management account
may contact support@kalkitech.com to receive the same.
