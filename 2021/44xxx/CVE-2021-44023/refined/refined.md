Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-44023:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability exists within the Platinum Host Service of Trend Micro Maximum Security.
*   It stems from the ability to create symbolic links that can be abused by the service to overwrite files.
*   Specifically the "PC Health Checkup" feature of the product is abused to create the symlinks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Symlink Abuse:** The core weakness is the ability for a low-privileged user to create symbolic links that can be leveraged by the Platinum Host Service to perform file operations.
*   **File Overwrite:** The service is not properly validating symlink targets which allows overwriting of arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can overwrite critical files resulting in a denial-of-service condition on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-Privileged Code Execution:** An attacker must first be able to execute code with low privileges on the targeted system.
*   **Local Access:** The attack is performed locally on the machine.
