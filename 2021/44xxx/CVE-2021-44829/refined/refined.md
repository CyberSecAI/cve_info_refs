Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-44829:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled input, specifically the "ID" parameter in the index page URL. This parameter is directly rendered into the HTML login form.
*   Additionally, content retrieved from the database is also not sanitized before being presented, leading to another avenue of attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The "ID" parameter in the URL is vulnerable to reflected XSS, as the unsanitized input is directly injected into the HTML output of the page.
*  **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** User-controlled input after login and content from the database are not sanitized before presentation, leading to stored XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web application via the vulnerable parameter.
*   This can lead to various impacts such as:
    *   **Stealing Cookies:** As demonstrated in the Proof of Concept (PoC), an attacker can steal session cookies.
    *   **Redirecting Users:** Attackers can redirect users to malicious websites.
    *   **Performing Actions on Behalf of Users:**  Malicious scripts could potentially perform actions within the web application using the user's session.
    *   **Compromising User Accounts** Attackers could potentially compromise user accounts, potentially leading to data breaches and further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through a crafted URL containing malicious script in the `id` parameter.
*   Additionally, other user-controlled inputs after login and unsanitized database content can be attack vectors for stored XSS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with XSS payload.
*   No specific privileged access or prior authentication to the application is required to perform reflected XSS attack.
*   For stored XSS, attackers would need to interact with the application in a manner that stores malicious data (e.g., by inputting malicious script in forms that are later stored in database and displayed).

**Additional Information:**

*   The affected product is "WebACMS" version 2.1.0 from AFI Solutions GmbH.
*   The vulnerability is identified as Cross-Site Scripting (CWE-79).
*   The vendor has been notified and provided a solution. The vendor recommends deactivating the vulnerable component since it is not actively used anymore.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Patrick Hener and Siva Rajendran of Thinking Objects GmbH.
