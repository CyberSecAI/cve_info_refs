- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Affected applications in SiPass Integrated and Siveillance Identity insufficiently limit access to the internal user authentication service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere (CWE-668). Insufficient access control to the internal user authentication service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger actions on behalf of valid user accounts. This could lead to unauthorized modifications of the system or potentially other harmful actions, although the specific actions are not detailed.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based (remote), and no special user interaction is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the affected system. No prior authentication is needed, and the attack can be carried out remotely.
