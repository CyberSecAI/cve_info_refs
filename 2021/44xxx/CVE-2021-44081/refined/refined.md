The provided content relates to CVE-2021-44081.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack buffer overflow vulnerability in the AMF (Access and Mobility Management Function) component of Open5GS version 2.1.4. Specifically, the AMF does not properly validate the length of the MSIN (Mobile Subscriber Identification Number) part of the SUPI (Subscriber Permanent Identifier) during the initial UE registration process. The AMF allocates a fixed buffer size (OGS_MAX_IMSI_BCD_LEN, which is 15), but if the received MSIN is longer than this, a stack buffer overflow occurs.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack buffer overflow due to lack of input validation.
- Fixed-size buffer allocation without checking the incoming data length.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Stack smashing.
- Denial of AMF service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending an initial UE registration message with an MSIN exceeding the expected length (15 characters + 24 additional characters).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted registration messages to the AMF.
- The attacker needs to be able to act as a UE (User Equipment) in the 5G network.
