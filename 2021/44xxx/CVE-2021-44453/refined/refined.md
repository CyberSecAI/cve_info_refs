The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44453.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command within the affected product's debug interface, specifically within a ping utility.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The ping utility within the debug interface does not properly sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary OS commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allows a remote attacker to inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands, which could lead to complete compromise of the affected products with high impact to confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote. An attacker can exploit the vulnerable ping utility within the debug interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable debug interface remotely. No authentication or user interaction is required.
