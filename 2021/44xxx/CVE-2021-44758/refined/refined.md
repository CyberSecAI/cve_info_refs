Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-44758:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing check in the `acceptor_start()` function of the SPNEGO implementation within Heimdal. Specifically, when an initial SPNEGO token is received with no acceptable mechanisms, the code does not handle the case where `gssspnego_ctx.preferred_mech_type` is equal to `GSS_C_NO_OID`. This condition leads to a NULL dereference when `send_accept()` is called with a non-zero 'initial_response' value. This occurs because the preferred mech is not set correctly, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **NULL Pointer Dereference:** The primary vulnerability is a NULL dereference that occurs because the code fails to handle the `GSS_C_NO_OID` value for the preferred mechanism.
*   **Missing Input Validation/Handling:** The code lacks proper input validation to handle cases where no acceptable mechanisms are present in the initial SPNEGO token, thus leading to the error.
*   **Logic Error:** There was a logical error in how the `send_accept()` function was used, which resulted in using the null `preferred_mech_type`, which should have been handled by calling `send_reject()`.
*   **Opportunistic Token Handling Issues:**  The introduction of opportunistic token handling introduced two bugs: the mechToken field was used unconditionally leading to a potential segfault and a condition where `send_accept()` could be called with `initial_response` true and the preferred mech as `GSS_C_NO_OID`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to cause a denial of service by sending a crafted SPNEGO token that has no acceptable mechanism which triggers the NULL pointer dereference, causing the server application to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, meaning an attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network.
*   **Crafted SPNEGO Token:**  The attacker needs to send a specially crafted SPNEGO token that includes no acceptable mechanisms to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the vulnerable service/server.
*   **Ability to Send SPNEGO Tokens:** The attacker needs to be able to initiate an SPNEGO authentication handshake and send specially crafted SPNEGO tokens.
*   **No Privileges Required:** The attacker does not require any special privileges to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:** No user interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability has existed since the initial revision of gssapi/spnego but was not likely to be triggered until later code revisions that introduced opportunistic token handling.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involves altering `acceptor_start()` so that it calls `send_reject()` when no mechanism was selected. This prevents the NULL dereference.
* The vulnerability is rated as "Low" severity, with a CVSS score of 0.0 (which seems incorrect based on the DoS impact). The Gentoo Security Advisory labels it as "high" severity and "exploitable remote".
