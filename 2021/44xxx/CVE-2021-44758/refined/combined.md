spnego: CVE-2021-44758 send\_reject when no mech selected

[Browse files](/heimdal/heimdal/tree/f9ec7002cdd526ae84fbacbf153162e118f22580)

```
This fixes a DoS where an initial SPNEGO token that has no acceptable
mechanisms causes a NULL dereference in acceptors.

send_accept() when called with a non-zero 'initial_response' did
not handle the case of gssspnego_ctx.preferred_mech_type equal
to GSS_C_NO_OID.

The failure to handle GSS_C_NO_OID has been present since the
initial revision of gssapi/spnego,
[2baa7e7](https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/commit/2baa7e7d613c26b2b037b368931519a84baec53d) but might not have
been exercised until later revisions.

The introduction of opportunistic token handling in
gss_accept_sec_context(), [3c9d326](https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/commit/3c9d3266f47f594a29068c9d629908e7000ac663),
introduced two bugs:

 1. The optional mechToken field is used unconditionally
    possibly resulting in a segmentation fault.

 2. If use of the opportunistic token is unsuccessful and the
    mech type list length is one, send_accept() can be called
    with 'initial_response' true and preferred mech set to
    GSS_C_NO_OID.

[b53c90d](https://github.com/heimdal/heimdal/commit/b53c90da0890a9cce6f95c552f094ff6d69027bf) ("Make error reporting
somewhat more correct for SPNEGO") attempted to fix the first
issue and increased the likelihood of the second.

This change alters the behavior of acceptor_start() so it calls
send_reject() when no mechanism was selected.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
