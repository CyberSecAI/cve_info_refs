- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An invalid memory address dereference in the `dump_od_to_saf.isra()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The code attempts to dereference a memory address that is invalid, leading to a segmentation fault.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A segmentation fault occurs, resulting in an application crash.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a crafted media file (poc.zip) using the `MP4Box` tool with the `-lsr` flag.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted file to the `MP4Box` utility, which the user must execute.
