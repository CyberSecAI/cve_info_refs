Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44681:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `EVStgOfflineOpns.exe` component of Veritas Enterprise Vault. This allows for the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is the application's failure to sanitize or validate data before deserializing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects that can be executed during the deserialization process.
- **.NET Remoting Vulnerability:**  The application uses .NET Remoting which has inherent vulnerabilities if not properly configured. The application starts several services that listen on random .NET Remoting TCP ports for possible commands from client applications.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Enterprise Vault server.
- **Context of Execution:** The code executes within the context of the "Enterprise Vault Storage Service". This typically provides high privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- **.NET Remoting TCP Ports:** Attackers target the .NET remoting TCP ports that are exposed by the Enterprise Vault Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without prior authentication to the Enterprise Vault server.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the vulnerable server to send malicious data.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the EV server, EV process IDs (random), EV TCP dynamic ports (random), and EV remoteable object URIs.
- **RDP Access (Specific Scenario):** The Veritas advisory mentions that for exploitation, an attacker needs to have RDP access to at least one VM in the network, be part of the Remote Desktop Users group,  and know the EV server's IP address, process IDs, and dynamic ports. The firewall on the EV server must also be improperly configured. This condition suggests that exploitation can be achieved also by an internal malicious actor, not only externally.

**Additional Details:**
- Veritas has released updates to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Veritas by Markus Wulftange through Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
- Multiple CVEs are related to similar deserialization issues in Veritas Enterprise Vault, as listed in the Veritas advisory (CVE-2021-44677, CVE-2021-44678, CVE-2021-44679, CVE-2021-44680, CVE-2021-44682).
