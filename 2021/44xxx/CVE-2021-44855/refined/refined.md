Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the VisualEditor media dialog incorrectly handling image metadata. The HTML from the API is taken, formatting is removed, and the resulting plain text is treated as HTML. This occurs when displaying image metadata fields, specifically in the "Source & Author(s)" input form during image upload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious code (JavaScript) can be injected into the "Source & Author(s)" fields when uploading an image. This code is then stored and executed when the image is inserted into a page using the VisualEditor's image insertion tool.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that executes in the context of a user's browser when they view a page containing the manipulated image. This could lead to various actions, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Stealing cookies or other sensitive information
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
1. **Image Upload:** An attacker uploads an image to Wikimedia Commons with a malicious payload in the "Source & Author(s)" fields.
2. **Image Insertion:** A user on a different wiki inserts the uploaded image into a page using the VisualEditor.
3. **XSS Trigger:** When the page loads and the VisualEditor attempts to display image metadata, the malicious JavaScript is executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs an account on Wikimedia Commons or similar platform that uses MediaWiki.
- They need to be able to upload files and enter information in the metadata fields.
- The attacker does not need any special access or privilege other than a user account.
- The attack requires a victim to use the visual editor and insert the malicious image into a page.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in the VisualEditor's media dialog and not dependent on how the image was uploaded.
- The bug was present in the code since 2015.
- The issue was fixed by properly escaping plaintext image metadata fields in the VisualEditor.
- Patches were created and deployed to production by the Wikimedia Security Team
