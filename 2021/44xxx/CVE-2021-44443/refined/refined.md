- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The JTTK library contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability when parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** A user is tricked into opening a malicious JT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create a malicious JT file and convince a user to open it with a vulnerable application.
