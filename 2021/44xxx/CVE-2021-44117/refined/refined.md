{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application lacks proper CSRF protection, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of authenticated users.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform actions as an authenticated user, such as deleting site variables, which could lead to data loss and potential disruption of the application's functionality.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a CSRF exploit that targets a vulnerable endpoint (e.g., the delete site variable function). The victim (an authenticated user of the application) is tricked into visiting this page."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs no prior knowledge other than the vulnerable endpoint. The attacker needs to trick the victim into visiting a webpage controlled by the attacker. The victim must have an active session on the vulnerable application.",
      "more_details": "The exploit specifically targets the deletion of site variables via the /fuel/sitevariables endpoint. The attacker first generates a CSRF proof of concept (POC) by intercepting the legitimate request with a logged-in user, then uses this POC to craft the attack. The attack is done on a separate user session on the same website which deletes variables without their consent. This action then affects the first users session as well."
