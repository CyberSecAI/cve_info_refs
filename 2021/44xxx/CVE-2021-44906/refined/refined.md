  "CVE-2021-44906": {
    "analysis": "The provided content from NetApp indicates that CVE-2021-44906 is one of multiple CVEs affecting IBM Cognos Analytics, which is incorporated in some NetApp products. The vulnerability itself is not detailed in the NetApp advisory, however the snyk.io content reveals that this CVE is related to a Prototype Pollution vulnerability found in the minimist npm package.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of input in the `minimist` library, which allows an attacker to manipulate the prototype of JavaScript objects using specific payloads like `__proto__` or `constructor`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Prototype Pollution"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service (DoS), remote code execution (RCE), or property injection, depending on the application's reliance on the polluted prototype.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attack vector is network-based, where an attacker can manipulate input to the vulnerable `minimist` library.",
        "The specific attack involves providing malicious arguments (e.g.  `--__proto__.injected0 value0`) that are parsed by `minimist`, leading to modifications in the Object.prototype.",
        "The exploit can also happen by Property definition by path (e.g. `theFunction(object, path, value)`), where attacker controls `path`, and then defines `__proto__.myValue`, assigning `myValue` to the object's prototype."

      ],
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send crafted input that will be processed by the vulnerable `minimist` library. No prior authentication is needed."
    },
     "additional_notes": "The stackoverflow content, while discussing adding custom properties to javascript functions, is not relevant to the vulnerability. The github content just contains a zip file with the proof of concept, which confirms the presence of a PoC, as reported on snyk.io."
