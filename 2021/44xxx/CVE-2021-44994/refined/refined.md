Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Content from github.com_7a1dd7f9_20250115_080728.html (Issue #4895):**

*   **Root Cause:** An assertion failure occurs in `ecma-objects.c` during the execution of JavaScript code in JerryScript. The assertion `ecma_object_check_class_name_is_object (obj_p)` fails within the `ecma_object_get_class_name` function.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** This indicates an issue in how JerryScript handles objects, specifically related to class names. The test case attempts to create objects and manipulate their prototypes and constructors, exposing an underlying flaw in the engine's object model.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The immediate impact is a crash due to the assertion failure which leads to denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:**  The vulnerability is triggered by specific JavaScript code that interacts with global objects, their constructors, and prototypes. The provided test case demonstrates the necessary code to trigger the crash.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute crafted JavaScript code within an environment using the vulnerable version of JerryScript.

**2. Content from github.com_6d36970d_20250115_080726.html (Issue #4894):**

*   **Root Cause:** An assertion failure occurs in `jmem-heap.c` during the finalization of the JerryScript heap. The assertion `JERRY_CONTEXT (jmem_heap_allocated_size) == 0` within the `jmem_heap_finalize` function fails.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** This indicates a memory leak within JerryScript's memory management when `Atomics.add` is used with `SharedArrayBuffer`. The heap allocated size is not being properly cleaned up.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** The immediate impact is a crash due to the assertion failure which leads to denial of service.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by JavaScript code using `SharedArrayBuffer` and `Atomics.add`. The specific PoC provided in the issue demonstrates the necessary steps.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to execute specific javascript code that uses SharedArrayBuffer and Atomics operations.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Both issues were found in the JerryScript project, which is a lightweight JavaScript engine.
*   Issue #4894 was fixed by a patch that addresses a memory leak related to atomic operations.
*   Issue #4895 is marked as a duplicate and was closed, likely because the root cause was addressed elsewhere (possibly in the fix for #4894 or a related issue).

Based on this analysis, neither issue directly relates to CVE-2021-44994 which is a placeholder. Therefore, the appropriate response is:

**UNRELATED**
