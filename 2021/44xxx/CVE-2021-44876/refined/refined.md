- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application leaks information about user validity through different messages during tenant identification.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: User enumeration vulnerability due to inconsistent error messages revealing the existence of valid users.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can identify valid usernames through brute force attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attack, exploiting the tenant identification process.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the application's tenant identification process. No prior authentication is required.
