- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application applies security configurations via URL paths but not on the struts action of the affected endpoint. This allows bypassing mitigations applied for CVE-2021-40175.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Security misconfiguration, lack of CSRF protection on affected endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote Code Execution (RCE) by uploading a malicious file (jsp).
- **Attack vectors**: By directly accessing the struts action route of the affected endpoint `/WC/ADSPersonalize.do?mTCall=updatePersonalizeSettings` and uploading a malicious jsp file disguised as a image file via the `LOGO_PATH` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable application. No authentication is needed since CSRF protection is missing from the exploited endpoint.
