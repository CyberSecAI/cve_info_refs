PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Polarion ALM is an application lifecycle management solution that improves software development
processes with a single, uniﬁed solution for requirements, coding, testing, and release.

Polarion WebClient for SVN, one of several free Subversion tools from Polarion Software, is a SVN client
that enables Subversion users to work with SVN repositories using a web browser. (https://polarion.plm.
automation.siemens.com/products/svn/svn_webclient)

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-44478

A cross-site scripting is present due to improper neutralization of data sent to the web page through
the SVN WebClient in the affected product.

An attacker could exploit this to execute arbitrary code and extract sensitive information by sending a
specially crafted link to users with administrator privileges.
