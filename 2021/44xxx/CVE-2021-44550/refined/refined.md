```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application includes unvalidated data in HTTP response headers.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The `classifier`, `outputFormat`, and `preserveSpacing` parameters from the HTTP request are directly added to the response headers without proper validation or sanitization.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "This can enable cache-poisoning, cross-site scripting, cross-user defacement, page hijacking, cookie manipulation or open redirect.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can manipulate the `classifier` parameter in the HTTP request.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request to the vulnerable endpoint."
