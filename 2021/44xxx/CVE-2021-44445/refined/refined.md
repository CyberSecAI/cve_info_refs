- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An out-of-bounds write past a fixed-length heap-based buffer occurs while parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploiting the vulnerability requires the user to open a maliciously crafted JT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to craft a malicious JT file and trick a user into opening it with a vulnerable application.
