The provided content details a blind time-based SQL injection vulnerability in the Online Motorcycle (Bike) Rental System 1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization in the login functionality. Specifically, the email parameter in the `Login.php?f=login_user` endpoint is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Blind Time-Based SQL Injection: The application does not directly output SQL error messages, so the attacker uses time delays to infer whether the injected SQL query is true or false.
- Unauthenticated access: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database, including usernames, emails, and passwords for both users and clients.
- The vulnerability can potentially lead to complete database compromise, depending on the database user's privileges and other vulnerabilities.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests to the `/classes/Login.php?f=login_user` endpoint
- Injection of malicious SQL code into the `email` parameter in the POST request body.
- Time-based inference, where the attacker crafts SQL queries to cause a time delay on the server when true, and no delay if false. This delay is observed using the `elapsed.total_seconds` attribute of python requests library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- A basic understanding of SQL injection and blind time-based exploitation is needed.
