{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's `id` parameter in `menu1.php` is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient sanitization/validation of user input.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "SQL Injection",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to sensitive data exposure. In this case, the attacker is able to use `load_file()` to cause the server to make a request to an external server, confirming successful injection. Further exploitation could allow an attacker to retrieve sensitive information for all users.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to `/onlineenrolmentsystem/menu1.php` with the malicious SQL payload injected into the `id` parameter within the request body.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication or specific access level is mentioned as a prerequisite. The attacker can send the crafted payload in the POST request to trigger the vulnerability."
