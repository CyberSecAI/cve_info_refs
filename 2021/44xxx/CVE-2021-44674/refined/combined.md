Released 2021-12-01

Linux SHA256 - 4c27c60e1f6ea96bbdf5a7f21fbc9d80ca2e2991091215d481fc1c6c60e3fc9a

Linux MD5 - 454316502bf423faa2336f8f5ad7f133

This release of Open-AudIT was bought forward because of the disclosure of two vulnerabilities.

This release fixes these issues.

The details of each can be found at:

* [Errata - 4.2.0 and earlier Javascript vulnerability](/wiki/spaces/OA/pages/3163951814/Errata%2B-%2B4.2.0%2Band%2Bearlier%2BJavascript%2Bvulnerability)
* [Errata - 4.2.0, 3.5.0 and onwards util function vulnerability](/wiki/spaces/OA/pages/3163951810/Errata%2B-%2B4.2.0%2B3.5.0%2Band%2Bonwards%2Butil%2Bfunction%2Bvulnerability)

| Version | Type | Collection | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Professional | Bug | Integrations | When multiple integrations are configured, multiple identical attributes would appear in the integrations details on the device details page. |
| Professional | New Feature | Discoveries | Retrieve and display installed certificates on Linux. Both system wide and Apache specific. |
| Professional | New Feature | Discoveries | Retrieve and display USB connected devices (exclude bluetooth on Windows). |
| Professional | Improvement | Queries | Add Query Details button to Query Execute template. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | There was an issue with PHP's SNMPv3 implementation. This is resolved for Linux where we now use net-snmp for initial credential testing. For Windows we cannot do this so the caveat is that where SNMPv3 is used, you must ***not*** have multiple credential sets (for SNMPv3) with ***identical security names***. |
| Professional | Improvement | Licenses | Add a license expiry date to /licenses entries. |
| Professional | Improvement | Discoveries | Provide a list of discovery issues with hints to how to resolve them. |
| Professional | Bug | Discoveries | Fix Active Directory discovery type option. AD discoveries now work again. |
| Professional | Bug | Integrations | Fix integrations fields for bool\_one\_zero and bool\_y\_n always staying 'false'. |
| Professional | Improvement | Devices | Provide an indication on the Devices List screen to indicate level of audit performed. |
| Community | Bug | Util | Filter out all characters except those in the allowed list for determining number of IPs in range or subnet for util::subnet\_size. See [Errata - 4.2.0, 3.5.0 and onwards util function vulnerability](/wiki/spaces/OA/pages/3163951810/Errata%2B-%2B4.2.0%2B3.5.0%2Band%2Bonwards%2Butil%2Bfunction%2Bvulnerability) |
| Community | Bug | All | Fix link creation to exclude user input. See [Errata - 4.2.0 and earlier Javascript vulnerability](/wiki/spaces/OA/pages/3163951814/Errata%2B-%2B4.2.0%2Band%2Bearlier%2BJavascript%2Bvulnerability) |
| Community | Improvement | All | For spawning processes, no longer use the execute script with a URL, now call PHP directly. No longer a requirement for http to be available from localhost. |
| Community | Improvement | Util | Allow downloading test\_windows\_client.vbs using the web interface at util/test\_windows\_client. |
| Community | Improvement | Audit | Improvements to test\_windows\_client.vbs:   * checks for RPC and NetLogon services * OS architecture |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Fix audit\_linux.sh to allow running on BusyBox. |
| Enterprise | Improvement | Clouds | Delete the associated discovery when we delete the cloud. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Update the MAC -> Manufacturer helper with more manufacturers. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Add Fortinet Fortigate models to SNMP Model Helper. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Detect Quest InTrust Agent in audit\_linux.sh. |
| Community | Bug | Devices | Fix for image upload path traversal issue. |
| Community | Improvement | Devices | Automatically add to filter for oae\_manage if request from Open-AudIT Enterprise on devices collection. |
| Community | Bug | Devices | Fix running multiple device discoveries from the Bulk Edit screen. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | Make all command line calls from Linux (winexe, smbclient) use a credentials file, rather than put the credentials on the command line. All work in wmi\_helper. |
| Community | Improvement | All | Update JS libraries for: jQuery Tablesorter, Bootstrap Table, Bootstrap FileStyle, Chartist. |
| Community | Improvement | Discoveries | More robust scp transfer test for success in ssh\_helper. |
| Community | Improvement | Rules | Improve discovery logging in m\_rules::execute. |
| Enterprise | Improvement | Collectors | When creating a discovery on a collector, include blank command\_options and remove options so we're SQL Strict compliant. |
| Professional | Improvement | Discoveries | Ensure the discovery export function retrieves all discovery logs. |
| Professional | Bug | Devices | Fix broken edit fields for Opmantek Details on devices read template for custom fields. |
| Professional | Improvement | All | Upgrade JS libraries for dataTables and HighCharts. |
| Professional | Improvement | Devices | On device details, only show discovery issues for the latest discovery. |

![](images/icon_lightbulb.png) **Did you know**:
Open-AudIT has been translated into German, French, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese.

" Just wanted to say thanks to the developers of OpenAudit, it is pretty much doing exactly what we wanted from it out of the box."

Bloater, [Forum User](http://www.open-audit.org/phpBB3/viewtopic.php?t=1745)

" I have just downloaded latest version of open audit, I had previously been using WINventory. Big thanks to everyone involved."

## Introducing Open-AudIT

Open-AudIT is an application to tell ![](images/icon_4.png) you exactly **what** is on your network, **how** it is configured and **when** it changes. Open-AudIT will run on Windows and Linux systems. Essentially, Open-AudIT is a database of information, that can be queried via a web interface. Data about the network is inserted via a Bash Script (Linux) or VBScript (Windows). The entire application is written in php, bash and vbscript. These are all 'scripting' languages - no compiling and human readable source code. Making changes and customisations is both quick and easy.

Windows PCs can be queried for hardware, software, ![](images/icon_1.png)operating system settings, security settings, ![](images/icon_2.png) IIS settings, services, users & groups and much more. Linux systems can be queried for a similar amount of information. Network devices (printers, switches, routers, etc) can have data recorded such as IP-Address, MAC Address, open ports, serial number, etc, etc. Output is available in PDF, CSV and webpages. There are export options for Dia and Inkscape.

Open-AudIT can be configured to scan your network and devices automatically. A daily scan is recommended for systems, with network scans every couple of hours. ![](images/icon_3.png)That way, you can be assured of being notified if something changes (day to day) on a PC, or even sooner, if something "new" appears on your network.

**Can you really afford not to know what's on your network ?**
