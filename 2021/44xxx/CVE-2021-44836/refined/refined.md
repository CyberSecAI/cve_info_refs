*   **Request Parameters:** The attacker needs to provide the `risqueId` parameter to identify the risk to be reopened.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the DeltaRM 1.2 application, even with basic privileges.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the application server.

**Additional Notes:**

* The provided content suggests that the vulnerability has been fixed by the vendor.
* The content also provides remediation advice which includes generic access control hardening practices.
