Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-44705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from accessing an uninitialized pointer within the parsing of JP2 images. Specifically, the code fails to validate the existence of an object before attempting to perform operations on it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Access of Uninitialized Pointer (CWE-824):** The core issue is that a pointer is used without being properly initialized, which can lead to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution:** The primary impact is the possibility of arbitrary code execution.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The ZDI advisory describes this vulnerability as an information disclosure vulnerability. It states that the uninitialized pointer access can potentially leak sensitive information.
*   The Adobe bulletin lists "privilege escalation" as a potential impact when combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The vulnerability is triggered through a local attack vector, meaning the attacker needs to have some level of access to the system.
*   **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction. The user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page containing a specially crafted JP2 image.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to entice a user to open a malicious JP2 file or visit a malicious web page.
*   The attacker would need to craft a malicious JP2 image that triggers the use of an uninitialized pointer.

**Additional Information:**

*   The Zero Day Initiative advisory provides a more detailed description of the vulnerability, specifying the issue is related to how JP2 images are parsed and how an object is not validated before operation.
*   The CVSS score associated with the vulnerability is 3.3.
*   The vulnerability is classified as "Critical" in the Adobe bulletin, but the CVSS score suggests a lower severity vulnerability. This suggests that the vulnerability may be more impactful when combined with other vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerability was reported by StakLeader via TianfuCup and Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
