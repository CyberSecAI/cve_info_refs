# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

I'm pretty sure $common\_output is html. You will need to make any fixes in `includes/html/common/alert-log.inc.php` instead.

Thank you for your response.

I can see that $common\_output has the variable $selected\_min\_severity in [here](https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/87951d28fdd3951495f59e8cf2cec4d025973209/includes/html/common/alert-log.inc.php#L122).

Which has a source [here](https://github.com/librenms/librenms/blob/87951d28fdd3951495f59e8cf2cec4d025973209/includes/html/common/alert-log.inc.php#L72)

What do you think ?

If I understand well the cast for int is for the function array\_search. but the variable $selected\_min\_severity will keep the string value. Because there is a concat string .= in the second assign.

```
$selected_min_severity = '<option value="' . $_POST['min_severity'] . '" selected="selected">';
$selected_min_severity .= array_search((int) $_POST['min_severity'], $alert_severities) . '</option>';
```

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
