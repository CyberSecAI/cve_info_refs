The content provided describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the Logistic Hub Parcel's Management System 1.0 by (oretnom23).

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to improper sanitization of the `username` parameter in the login functionality. Specifically, the application directly uses user-supplied input in a SQL query without proper escaping or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the `username` parameter within the login form.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can potentially bypass authentication, gain access to sensitive data, modify database entries, or potentially execute arbitrary commands on the database server if the database user has sufficient privileges. The provided SQL error indicates an issue with retrieving data, suggesting an attacker could use SQL injection to manipulate the query.
- The error message indicates a potential for information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the login form of the application by manipulating the `username` parameter in a POST request to `/lhpms/Actions.php?a=login`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the web server hosting the vulnerable application and have knowledge of the parameter to manipulate.
