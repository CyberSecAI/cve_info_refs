Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-44683

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the mishandling of JavaScript's `window.open` function in the affected mobile browsers when opening a secondary window.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Address Bar Spoofing: The core weakness is the ability to manipulate the address bar in a secondary window to display a legitimate URL while the content is actually served from a malicious server. This bypasses the security checks that users rely on to verify website authenticity.
- Mishandling of JavaScript's `window.open` function: This specific function is used to open a secondary window and is vulnerable to the exploit.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Deceptive URLs:** Attackers can create malicious pages that appear to be legitimate websites (e.g., banking, social media).
- **Phishing Attacks:** Users can be tricked into entering sensitive information (usernames, passwords, personal data) on these fake pages, believing they are interacting with the real website.
- **Erosion of Trust:** The vulnerability undermines user trust in the browser's address bar as a security indicator.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack requires an attacker to create a malicious web page designed to open a secondary window using the `window.open` function in the vulnerable browser.
- Users need to be lured to this malicious web page, often via phishing or other social engineering techniques.
- Once the malicious page is loaded within the vulnerable browser, the secondary window is opened displaying the spoofed URL in the address bar.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need to be able to create and host a malicious web page.
- They need to be able to entice users into visiting that page.
- No special network position is required. The attack is a client side vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found in DuckDuckGo (iOS) and Tap Browser (iOS) for mobile browsers.
- DuckDuckGo has addressed the issue in version 7.64.18. However, Tap Browser has not been updated.
- The content references similar address bar spoofing vulnerabilities found in other browsers by the same researchers.
-  The article emphasizes the increased threat of phishing attacks in the current online landscape.
