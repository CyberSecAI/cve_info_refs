Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44521:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2021-44521. The description from openwall.com clearly states "CVE-2021-44521: Apache Cassandra: Remote code execution for scripted UDFs." The other sources confirm that this vulnerability exists within Apache Cassandra.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to execute arbitrary code on the host when Apache Cassandra is configured with specific, non-default settings relating to User-Defined Functions (UDFs). The core issue is that when  `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` is set to `false` it causes UDFs to run within the Cassandra daemon thread which has broader permissions which, combined with the ability to turn off the Security Manager (using `java.lang.System.setSecurityManager(null)`), allows an attacker to escape the UDF sandbox. Also, the class filtering mechanism, meant to restrict the access to java packages from within the UDF, can be bypassed.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insecure UDF Execution:** The ability to execute user-defined functions, especially scripted ones, without proper sandboxing when `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` is set to `false`.
    *   **Insufficient Security Manager:** The Java Security Manager is disabled by setting it to null, which allows the UDF script to perform privileged operations.
    *   **Class Filter Bypass:** The custom class filtering mechanism using a whitelist and blacklist is bypassed with a Nashorn engine instance.
    *   **Unsafe Object Deserialization:** The `cassandra-stressd` tool deserializes input data from the socket, enabling RCE through a crafted serialized object if listening on a public interface.
    *   **Lack of Granular Permissions:** Any user, including anonymous users (default setting) are able to create and execute UDFs if UDF are enabled.
    *   **Lack of proper timeout mechanism for UDF threads**: An attacker can DoS Cassandra by creating a never-ending UDF function that will not be terminated and will block the daemon thread if the `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` is set to false.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers can execute arbitrary code on the host system where Cassandra is running by abusing scripted UDFs.
    *   **Data Breaches and Manipulation:** Attackers may gain access to sensitive information stored within Cassandra or modify data.
    *   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  Attackers can crash the entire Cassandra daemon through long-running UDFs if the `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` configuration option is set to `false`, or through the use of the `cassandra-stressd` tool if listening on a public interface with a specially crafted object that triggers code execution on deserialization.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Scripted UDFs:** An attacker with privileges to create UDFs can craft a malicious function with a payload using the JavaScript engine.
    *   **`cassandra-stressd` tool:** If the tool is configured to listen to a public interface, a crafted serialized object can be sent to the server, causing it to execute arbitrary code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Create UDF privileges:** The attacker needs to have sufficient permissions to create UDFs within the Cassandra cluster. Default settings allow all users, even anonymous, to create and execute arbitrary UDFs.
    *   **Network access:** For the `cassandra-stressd` vector, the attacker needs network access to the port where the service listens.

**3. Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when `enable_user_defined_functions: true`, `enable_scripted_user_defined_functions: true` and `enable_user_defined_functions_threads: false` are set in the `cassandra.yaml` configuration. The `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` is the core vulnerability, since it causes the UDF code to run in the Cassandra daemon thread which has broad permissions and does not enforce the custom sandbox, and thus allows bypassing the security manager and the class filter.
*   The `cassandra-stressd` tool runs by default on localhost, but can be made to listen to arbitrary interfaces through the `-h` flag, which opens the tool to RCE vulnerability.
*   NetApp's advisory confirms that their products do not use the vulnerable configuration, and therefore their products are not affected.

**4. Mitigation:**

*   **Upgrade:**  Users of Apache Cassandra versions 3.0, 3.11, and 4.0 should upgrade to versions 3.0.26, 3.11.12, and 4.0.2, respectively, or later.
*  **Configuration:**  Set `enable_user_defined_functions_threads` to `true` (which is default).
*   **Disable UDFs:** If UDFs are not required, disable them by setting `enable_user_defined_functions: false`.
*   **Restrict UDF privileges:** Remove the permissions of creating, altering and executing functions for untrusted users by revoking the `ALL FUNCTIONS`, `ALL FUNCTIONS IN KEYSPACE` and `FUNCTION` for `CREATE`, `ALTER` and `EXECUTE` queries.
*   **Secure `cassandra-stressd`:**  Ensure that the `cassandra-stressd` tool is not listening on external interfaces.
