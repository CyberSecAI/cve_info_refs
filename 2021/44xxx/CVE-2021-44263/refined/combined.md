## Description

Stored Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Gurock TestRail before 7.1.2 allows an authenticated threat actors to inject arbitrary web script or HTML via the reference field in milestones or description fields in reports.

Product: [TestRail](https://www.gurock.com/testrail/)
Version: Prior v7.1.2.1044
Vendor: [Gurock](https://www.gurock.com/)

## Rating (initial, not-confirmed yet)

Severity: Medium (6.6)
CVSS v3.1 Vector: [AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N/E:P/RL:O/RC:C](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:P/RL:O/RC:C&version=3.1)
Base Score Metrics
The Base metric group represents the intrinsic characteristics of a vulnerability that are constant over time and across user environments. It is composed of two sets of metrics: the Exploitability metrics and the Impact metrics. The Exploitability metrics reflect the ease and technical means by which the vulnerability can be exploited. That is, they represent characteristics of the thing that is vulnerable, which we refer to formally as the vulnerable component. On the other hand, the Impact metrics reflect the direct consequence of a successful exploit, and represent the consequence to the thing that suffers the impact, which we refer to formally as the impacted component.

Exploitability Metrics
Attack Vector (AV): Network
Attack Complexity (AC): Low
Privileges Required (PR): Low
User Interaction (UI): Required
Scope (S): Unchanged

Impact Metrics
Confidentiality Impact (C): High
Integrity Impact (I): High
Availability Impact (A): None

## Steps to reproduce

1. Login to a TestRail application with version prior v7.1.2.1044.
2. Navigate to Milestones
3. Create new Milestone
   3.1 Provide dummy data for any other field except reference
   3.2 In Reference put `"><img src=x onerror=console.log(document.domain)>`
   3.3 Save and submit
4. You should be able to see an alert/console log entry.
5. Navigate to Reports
6. Create new Report
   6.1 Provide dummy data for any other field except description
   6.2 In Reference put `"><img src=x onerror=console.log(document.domain)>`
   3.3 Save and submit
7. You should be able to see an alert/console log entry.
