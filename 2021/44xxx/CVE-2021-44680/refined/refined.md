Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-44680

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Deserialization of untrusted data within the `EVMonitoring.exe` component of Veritas Enterprise Vault. The application fails to properly validate user-supplied data, leading to the vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core issue lies in how the application processes and deserializes incoming data, allowing an attacker to inject malicious payloads.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not adequately validate the data it receives, which enables the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected server.
*   **Execution Context:** The code executes within the context of the Enterprise Vault Admin Service.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker gains full control over the system if exploitation is successful.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable over the network.
*   **TCP Ports:** The attack targets .NET Remoting TCP ports that Enterprise Vault services use for inter-process communication.
*   **Specifically Crafted Data:** The attacker needs to send specially crafted data to a vulnerable Enterprise Vault server for successful exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** Attackers must have network access to the vulnerable Enterprise Vault server.
*   **No Authentication Required:** Authentication is not required for exploitation, as specified by ZDI advisory.
*   **RDP Access (Conditional):** While not required, having RDP access to a machine within the network makes finding the target easier, however, it is not required to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of EV Details (Conditional):** While not strictly required for exploitation, knowledge of IP addresses, process IDs, dynamic ports, and remoteable object URIs would aid an attacker.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8.
*   The issue affects all currently supported versions of Veritas Enterprise Vault.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Markus Wulftange and Reno Robert working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative (ZDI)
*   Veritas has released an update to correct this vulnerability.
