Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-44033:

**Root Cause:**
- The failed unlock attempt counter for PIN authentication in Ionic Identity Vault is stored only in memory. This means that when the application is closed or terminated, the counter is reset.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **In-Memory Counter:** The core vulnerability is the use of an in-memory counter for tracking failed PIN attempts. This allows an attacker to bypass the lockout mechanism by simply closing and reopening the app.
- **Lack of Persistent Storage:**  The counter should have been stored persistently to prevent manipulation through application restarts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the PIN lockout mechanism, enabling them to brute-force the PIN without being blocked. This allows unauthorized access to protected data stored in the vault.
- **Data Exposure:** If the vault contains sensitive information such as authentication tokens, the attacker could gain unauthorized access to user accounts or other protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Physical Access:** The primary attack vector requires physical access to the device where the vulnerable application is installed.
- **Application Manipulation:** An attacker needs to close/terminate and reopen the application to reset the failed unlock counter.
- **Automated Brute-forcing:**  The attack can be automated using tools like the Android Debug Bridge (adb).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Physical Access to the Device:** The attacker must have physical access to the device.
- **Basic Technical Skills:**  The attacker needs a basic understanding of how to close/restart mobile apps and potentially use tools like ADB for automation.
- **No Root Access Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without root access to the device. However, having root access would allow more sophisticated attacks.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects both Android and iOS versions of the Ionic Identity Vault library <= 5.0.4.
- The fix is included in Ionic Identity Vault version 5.0.5 and later, which now stores the failed attempt counter persistently.
- The CVSS v3.1 score for this vulnerability is 5.9 (Medium) with the vector: AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N
