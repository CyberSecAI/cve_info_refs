- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application is vulnerable to stored XSS attacks, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored and then executed when other users interact with the affected functionality.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, and the attacker can exploit this vulnerability without direct interaction from the victim, but requires user interaction to execute. 
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special privileges and can perform the attack over the network, requiring the user to trigger the execution of the injected script by interacting with the application.
