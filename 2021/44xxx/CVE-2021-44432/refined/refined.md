- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Stack-based buffer overflow while parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** Opening a maliciously crafted JT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** User needs to be tricked into opening a malicious JT file. Local access is sufficient (AV:L), no privileges required (PR:N), User interaction is required (UI:R).
