- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application directly incorporates user-supplied input from the `id` GET parameter into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization. Specifically, the code in `\App\Manage\Controller\DownloadController.class.php` at lines 18-21 constructs the SQL query using string concatenation, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the query via the `id` GET parameter.

- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Data Breach:** Attackers can gain access to sensitive database information, potentially including user credentials, personal data, and application data.
    - **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify or delete data within the database.
    - **Denial of Service:** Attackers might be able to disrupt the application by executing malicious queries.
    - **Server Compromise:** In some cases, an attacker may use SQL injection to gain control over the server or underlying systems.
    - **Information Disclosure**: As demonstrated in the provided POC, the user() function of the database can be extracted, disclosing potentially sensitive information.

- **Attack vectors**:
    - **HTTP GET Request:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a specifically crafted `id` parameter containing SQL injection payloads, such as: `http://127.0.0.1/index.php/Download/Index/Column?id=1%20and%20(extractvalue(1,concat(0x7e,(select%20user()),0x7e)))`.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker needs to have the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server, which is generally accessible to anyone with network access to the application.
