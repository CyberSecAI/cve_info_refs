The Open Portable Trusted Execution Environment (OP-TEE) [1] is an open sourceTrusted Execution Environment (TEE) implementing the Arm TrustZone technology.
F-Secure Foundry, in the process of developing its own TEE framework (GoTEE[2]), reviewed the existing Open Source offering and identified a vulnerabilityin OP-TEE support for the Central Security Unit (CSU) configuration on the NXPi.MX6UL System-on-Chip (SoC).
Based on this, as well as previous [7] findings, F-Secure advises OP-TEE usersto treat all OP-TEE supported platforms as insecure by default and carefullyreview and practically test their implementation before integration.
TrustZone configuration on i.MX SoCs------------------------------------
The following GoTEE tutorial [3] provides an in-depth explanation of thevarious aspects of an effective TrustZone configuration.
In a nutshell, along with standard ARM core configuration, each SoC requiresits peripherals to be assigned to either the Secure World or Normal World (akaNonSecure World), which respectively represent the privileged and unprivilegedTrustZone domains.
The Central Security Unit (CSU) is the component that enables TrustZoneperipheral configuration on the NXP i.MX family for peripherals that arenot capable of asserting TrustZone signals independently.
The CSU Config Security Level (CSL) defines restrictions for accessingindividual (or groups of) peripherals (e.g. whether a peripheral can beaccessed from NonSecure World) while the Security Access (SA) defines theaccess security policy for the peripheral (e.g. whether the peripheralmakes bus accesses as "Secure" or "NonSecure").
Vulnerability (CVE-2021-44149)------------------------------
The OP-TEE OS CSU driver [4] sets the CSU Security Access (SA) policy for theARM Cortex-A7 block (CA7) to "Secure" for its NXP i.MX6UL SoC support.
The NXP documentation on the role of the CA7 SA setting does not provide anydetails on its effects, therefore F-Secure conducted a thorough analysis of itsmanipulation, which resulted in identification of a vulnerability.
It has been verified that the OP-TEE configuration allows a processor suspendedin Normal World security state to wake up from low power mode in Secure Worldstate.
The wakeup sequence implemented in the NXP i.MX6UL boot ROM jumps, in secureprocessor state, to function pointers held in the System Reset Controller (SRC)registers. The vulnerability takes place when the Normal World OS is allowed toset the SRC wakeup pointers before going in low power mode.
For example when running Linux under OP-TEE OS the boot ROM executes a wakeuphandler previously configured by Normal World Linux, within Secure World. Thisresults in Linux re-initializing the MMU and resuming all its execution contextas Secure World.
This configuration effectively bypasses any intended TrustZone protection asthe Normal World OS is capable of transforming itself, through a low powersuspend/wakeup procedure, to a Secure one.
It should be highlighted that the boot ROM unconditionally wakes up in secureprocessor state. The CA7 SA only affects the CP15SDISABLE input signal which,when set as "NonSecure", causes a fault in the boot ROM code, even if runningin Secure World, as it becomes incapable of accessing specific secure registersneeded by its wake up flow.
Impact------
On vanilla OP-TEE OS the NXP i.MX6UL SoC has no effective TrustZone isolationas the Normal World can arbitrarily change its processor state to Secure World,resulting in a full compromise of the Trusted Execution Environment.
The same vulnerability also applies to the NXP OP-TEE fork [5].
Mitigation----------
Any suspend/wakeup functionality must be handled by the Secure World TEE as theCSU Config Security Level (CSL) must be set to protect, from Normal Worldaccess, all blocks responsible for the wakeup sequence such as the GPC and SRCblocks on the i.MX6UL SoC family.
When suspend/wakeup functionality is not required, implementers of trustedfirmware using the OP-TEE framework can re-configure the SA policy ensuringthat the CA7 value is set as "NonSecure" prior to Normal World execution.
When running Linux in Normal World this is incompatible with Linux powermanagement drivers which require SRC support on i.MX6 SoCs (example:`CONFIG\_CPU\_IDLE`).
It is emphasized that changing the CA7 SA policy bit to "NonSecure", whileeffective, represents a weaker form of mitigation as the exploitation of thevulnerability is only incidentally prevented, the proper mitigation remains theCSL protection for the responsible GPC and SRC blocks.
Please also note that such mitigations do not constitute an example of a fullysecure configuration and only focus on the specific aspects reported in thisadvisory.
Vendor response---------------
The OP-TEE project own security advisory can be found at [8].
Affected versions-----------------
The OP-TEE OS component of all OP-TEE releases supporting the NXP i.MX6UL SoCis vulnerable, this includes any fork (such as the NXP one [5]) based on themthat does not correctly prevent Normal World control of the System ResetController (SRC) wakeup execution context.
Please be advised that OP-TEE does not provide a secure CSU configuration onmultiple NXP i.MX P/Ns for reasons which go beyond this specific finding (seeCVE-2021-36133 [7]).
