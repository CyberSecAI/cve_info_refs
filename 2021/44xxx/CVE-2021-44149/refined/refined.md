Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44149:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the OP-TEE OS CSU driver incorrectly configuring the Security Access (SA) policy for the ARM Cortex-A7 (CA7) block on NXP i.MX6UL SoCs. Specifically, the CA7 SA is set to "Secure," while the NXP boot ROM unconditionally wakes up in the secure processor state. This allows the Normal World OS to set the System Reset Controller (SRC) wakeup pointers, causing the system to boot into the Secure World even if the system was in a non-secure context before sleeping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Insecure Wakeup:** The core issue is that the Normal World OS can control the wakeup pointers in the System Reset Controller (SRC), which are then used by the boot ROM.
*   **Incorrect CSU configuration:** The CSU driver sets the CA7 SA policy to "Secure", which, in combination with the secure world wakeup, allows Normal world code to execute in Secure World after wakeup.
*   **Lack of TrustZone Isolation:** The vulnerability violates the core purpose of TrustZone by allowing code that should execute in the Normal World to execute in Secure World.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **TrustZone Bypass:** An attacker who controls the Normal World OS can use the suspend/wakeup functionality to execute arbitrary code in the Secure World, fully compromising the Trusted Execution Environment (TEE).
*   **Full System Compromise:** By gaining control of the Secure World, an attacker can potentially access sensitive data and control critical system functions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Low Power State Transition:** The attack is triggered when the system transitions to and from a low power/suspend state.
*   **Manipulation of SRC Wakeup Pointers:** The Normal World OS manipulates the System Reset Controller (SRC) wakeup pointers before entering low power mode.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Control over Normal World OS:** The attacker must have the ability to execute code in the Normal World OS (e.g. Linux) to manipulate the SRC wakeup pointers.
*   **Ability to trigger suspend/wakeup:** The attacker has to be able to put the system into a low power mode to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory highlights that simply changing the CA7 SA policy to "NonSecure" is a weaker mitigation. The proper solution involves using the CSU Config Security Level (CSL) to restrict access to the GPC and SRC blocks.
* The vulnerability affects all versions of OP-TEE OS that support the NXP i.MX6UL SoC, as well as forks based on them that do not correctly prevent Normal World control of the SRC.
* The content references CVE-2021-36133, indicating this is not the only CSU related vulnerability in OP-TEE.
* The content provides more detailed technical information than the basic CVE description, specifically explaining the interaction between the CA7 SA bit, boot ROM, SRC, and the suspend/wakeup sequence.
