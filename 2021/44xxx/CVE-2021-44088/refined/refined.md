The provided content is related to a SQL Injection vulnerability but does not correspond to CVE-2021-44088.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application is vulnerable to SQL Injection due to improper sanitization of user-supplied input. Specifically, the username field in the login form is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   SQL Injection (SQLi)

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Authentication bypass: The attacker can bypass the login page and gain administrative access to the application without valid credentials.
*   Potentially full database access: The attacker may be able to retrieve, modify, or delete data from the database.

**Attack vectors:**
*   HTTP POST request to the login page `/apsystem/admin/login.php`

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   No prior authentication is needed.

**Technical Details:**
The provided python script exploits the SQL injection vulnerability by crafting a malicious payload for the `username` field. The payload uses a `UNION SELECT` statement to inject a new user record, allowing the attacker to log in with the created user. This payload is sent in the HTTP POST request to the login page (`/apsystem/admin/login.php`). The injected record uses a predefined username and a hardcoded password hash. The attacker then extracts the session cookie which is used to access the admin panel.
