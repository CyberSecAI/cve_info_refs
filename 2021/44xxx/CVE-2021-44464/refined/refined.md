Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44464:

**CVE-2021-44464: Use of Hard-coded Credentials**

*   **Root Cause:** The Vigilant MasterMed application contains service credentials that are likely to be the same across all installations.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Use of hard-coded credentials.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who obtains these hardcoded credentials can gain privileges on all installations of the software. This allows the attacker to manipulate RabbitMQ queues and messages by impersonating users.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Network-based. An attacker with network access to the application can exploit the hardcoded credentials after discovering them.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application and must be able to discover the hardcoded credentials. They also need to be able to use these credentials to authenticate to the application. The attacker needs to have at least low privileged access.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the use of hardcoded credentials within the Vigilant MasterMed application. An attacker who discovers these credentials can use them to gain unauthorized access and perform malicious actions within the system by impersonating users and manipulating message queues.
