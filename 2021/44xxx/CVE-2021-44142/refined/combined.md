MIME Encapsulation of Macintosh files - MacMIME
Status of this Memo
This document specifies an Internet standards track protocol for the
Internet community, and requests discussion and suggestions for
improvements. Please refer to the current edition of the "Internet
Official Protocol Standards" (STD 1) for the standardization state
and status of this protocol. Distribution of this memo is unlimited.
Abstract
This memo describes the format to use when sending Apple Macintosh
files via MIME [BORE93]. The format is compatible with existing
mechanisms for distributing Macintosh files, while allowing non-
Macintosh systems access to data in standardized formats.
2. Introduction
Files on the Macintosh consists of two parts, called forks:
Data fork: The actual data included in the file. The Data
fork is typically the only meaningful part of a
Macintosh file on a non-Macintosh computer system.
For example, if a Macintosh user wants to send a
file of data to a user on an IBM-PC, she would only
send the Data fork.
Resource fork: Contains a collection of arbitrary attribute/value
pairs, including program segments, icon bitmaps,
and parametric values.
Additional information regarding Macintosh files is stored by the
Finder in a hidden file, called the "Desktop Database".
Because of the complications in storing different parts of a
Macintosh file in a non-Macintosh filesystem that only handles
consecutive data in one part, it is common to convert the Macintosh
file into some other format before transferring it over the network.
Faltstrom, Crocker & Fair [Page 1]

RFC 1740 MIME-based Mac files December 1994
The two styles of use are [APPL90]:
AppleSingle: Apple's standard format for encoding Macintosh files
as one byte stream.
AppleDouble: Similar to AppleSingle except that the Data fork is
separated from the Macintosh-specific parts by the
AppleDouble encoding.
AppleDouble is the preferred format for a Macintosh file that is to
be included in an Internet mail message, because it provides
recipients with Macintosh computers the entire document, including
Icons and other Macintosh specific information, while other users
easily can extract the Data fork (the actual data) as it is separated
from the AppleDouble encoding.
2. MIME format for Apple/Macintosh-specific file information
2a. APPLICATION/APPLEFILE
MIME type-name: APPLICATION
MIME subtype name: APPLEFILE
Required parameters: none
Optional parameters: NAME, which must be a "value" as
defined in RFC-1521 [BORE93].
Encoding considerations: The presence of binary data will
typically require use of
Content-Transfer-Encoding: BASE64
Security considerations: See separate section in the document
Published specification: Apple-single & Apple-double [APPL90]
Rationale: Permits MIME-based transmission of
data with Apple/Macintosh specific
information, while allowing general
access to non-specific user data.
2b. MULTIPART/APPLEDOUBLE
MIME type-name: MULTIPART
MIME subtype name: APPLEDOUBLE
Required parameters: none
Optional parameters: NAME, which must be a "value" as
defined in RFC-1521 [BORE93].
Encoding considerations: none
Security considerations: See separate section in the document
Published specification: Apple-single & Apple-double [APPL90]
Rationale: Permits MIME-based transmission of
data with Apple/Macintosh specific
information, while allowing general
access to non-specific user data.

2c. Detail specific to MIME-based usage
Macintosh documents do not always need to be sent in a special
format. Those documents with well-known MIME types and
non-existent or trivial resource forks can be sent as regular
MIME body parts, without use of AppleSingle or AppleDouble.
Documents which lack a data fork must be sent as AppleSingle.
Unless there are strong reasons not to, all other documents
should normally be sent as AppleDouble. This includes documents
with non-trivial resource forks, and documents without
corresponding well-known MIME types.
It may be valuable in some cases to allow the user to choose one
format over another, either because he disagrees with the
implementor's definition of "trivial" resource forks, or for
reasons of his own.
3. AppleSingle
An AppleSingle, version 2 file, is sent as one consecutive stream of
bytes. The format is described in [APPL90] with a brief summary in
Appendix A. The one and only part of the file is sent in an
application/applefile message.
The first four bytes of an AppleSingle header are, in hexadecimal:
00, 05, 16, 00.
The AppleSingle file is binary data. Hence, it may be necessary to
perform a Content-Transfer-Encoding for transmission, depending on
the underlying email transport environment. The safest encoding is
Base64, since it permits transfer over the most restricted channels.
Even though an AppleSingle file includes the original Macintosh
filename, it is recommended that a name parameter be included on the
Content-Type header to give the recipient a hint as to what file is
attached. The value of the name parameter must be a "value" as
defined by RFC-1521 [BORE93]. Note that this restricts the value to
seven-bit US-ASCII characters.
3a. AppleSingle example
Content-Type: application/applefile; name="Computers-1/2-93"
[The AppleSingle file goes here]
4. AppleDouble
Faltstrom, Crocker & Fair [Page 3]

RFC 1740 MIME-based Mac files December 1994
An AppleDouble, version 2, file is divided in two parts:
Header: including the Macintosh resource fork and desktop
information and
Data fork: containing the Macintosh data fork.
The AppleDouble format is described in [APPL90] with a brief summary
in Appendix B.
The AppleDouble file itself is sent as a multipart/appledouble MIME
body-part, which may have only two sub-parts. The header is sent as
application/applefile and the data fork as whatever best describes
it. For example, is the data for is actually a GIF image, it should
be sent as image/gif. If no appropriate Content-Type has been
registered for the data type, it should be sent as an
application/octet-stream.
The first four bytes of an AppleDouble header are, in hexadecimal:
00, 05, 16, 07.
The AppleDouble header is binary data. Hence, it may be necessary to
perform a Content-Transfer-Encoding for transmission, depending on
the underlying email transport environment. The safest encoding is
Base64, since it permits transfer over the most restrictive channels.
Even though an AppleDouble file includes the original Macintosh
filename, it is recommended that a name parameter be included on the
Content-Type header of both the header and data parts of the
AppleDouble file to give the recipient a hint as to what file is
attached. The value of the name parameter must be a "value" as
defined by RFC-1521 [BORE93]. Note that this restricts the value to
seven-bit US-ASCII characters.
4a. AppleDouble example
Content-Type: multipart/appledouble; boundary=mac-part
--mac-part
Content-Type: application/applefile; name="My-new-car"
[The AppleDouble header goes here]
--mac-part
Content-Type: image/gif;
[The data fork goes here]
--mac-part--

6. Security Considerations
To the extent that application/applefile facilitates the transmission
of operating-system sensitive data, it may open a door for easier
relaxation of security rules than is intended either by the sender of
the administrator of the sender's system.

RFC 1740 MIME-based Mac files December 1994
Appendix A. The AppleSingle format
In the AppleSingle format, a file's contents and attributes are
stored in a single file in the foreign file system. For example,
both forks of a Macintosh file, the Finder information, and an
associated comment are arranged in a single file with a simple
structure.
An AppleSingle file consists of a header followed by one or more data
entries. The header consists of several fixed fields and a list of
entry descriptors, each pointing to a data entry. Each entry is
optional and may or may not appear in the file.
AppleSingle file header:
Field Length
Magic number 4 bytes
Version number 4 bytes
Filler 16 bytes
Number of entries 2 bytes
Entry descriptor for each entry:
Entry ID 4 bytes
Offset 4 bytes
Length 4 bytes
Byte ordering in the file fields follows MC68000 conventions, most
significant byte first. The fields in the header file follow the
conventions described in the following sections.
Magic number
This field, modelled after the UNIX magic number feature,
specifies the file's format. Apple has defined the magic number
for the AppleSingle format as $00051600 or 0x00051600.
Version number
This field denotes the version of AppleSingle format in the event
the format evolves (more fields may be added to the header). The
version described in this note is version $00020000 or
0x00020000.
Filler
This field is all zeros ($00 or 0x00).
Number of entries
This field specifies how many different entries are included in
Faltstrom, Crocker & Fair [Page 7]

RFC 1740 MIME-based Mac files December 1994
the file. It is an unsigned 16-bit number. If the number of
entries is any number other than 0, then that number of entry
descriptors immediately follows the number of entries field.
Entry descriptors
The entry descriptor is made up of the following three fields:
Entry ID: an unsigned 32-bit number, defines what the entry is.
Entry IDs range from 1 to $FFFFFFFF. Entry ID 0 is
invalid.
Offset: an unsigned 32-bit number, shows the offset from the
beginning of the file to the beginning of the entry's
data.
Length: an unsigned 32-bit number, shows the length of the
data in bytes. The length can be 0.
Predefined entry ID's
Apple has defined a set of entry IDs and their values as follows:
Data Fork 1 Data fork
Resource Fork 2 Resource fork
Real Name 3 File's name as created on home file
system
Comment 4 Standard Macintosh comment
Icon, B&W 5 Standard Macintosh black and white icon
Icon, Colour 6 Macintosh colour icon
File Dates Info 8 File creation date, modification date,
and so on
Finder Info 9 Standard Macintosh Finder information
Macintosh File Info 10 Macintosh file information, attributes
and so on
ProDOS File Info 11 ProDOS file information, attributes and
so on
MS-DOS File Info 12 MS-DOS file information, attributes and
so on
Short Name 13 AFP short name
AFP File Info 14 AFP file, information, attributes and so
on
Directory ID 15 AFP directory ID
Apple reserves the range of entry IDs from 1 to $7FFFFFFF. The
rest of the range is available for applications to define their
own entries. Apple does not arbitrate the use of the rest of the
range.
Appendix B. The AppleDouble format
Faltstrom, Crocker & Fair [Page 8]

RFC 1740 MIME-based Mac files December 1994
The AppleDouble format uses two files to store data, resources and
attributes. The AppleDouble Data file contains the data fork and the
AppleDouble Header file contains the resource fork.
The AppleDouble Data file contains the standard Macintosh data fork
with no additional header. The AppleDouble Header file has exactly
the same format as the AppleSingle file, except that it does not
contain a Data fork entry. The magic number in the AppleDouble
Header file differs from the magic number in the AppleSingle Header
file so that an application can tell whether it needs to look in
another file for the data fork. The magic number for the AppleDouble
format is $00051607 or 0x00051607.
The entries in the AppleDouble Header file can appear in any order;
however, since the resource fork is the entry that is most commonly
extended (after the data fork), Apple recommends that the resource
fork entry to be placed last in the file. The data fork is easily
extended because it resides by itself in the AppleDouble Data file.
Appendix C. applefile.h
This is an example of a header file for the language C which can be
used when parsing the data in either an AppleSingle file or
AppleDouble header.
The file is written by Lee Jones. Distribution is unlimited.

The following is a list of all publicly disclosed vulnerabilities discovered
by Zero Day Initiative researchers. While the affected vendor
is working on a patch for these vulnerabilities,
[Trend Micro](https://www.trendmicro.com/us/security-intelligence/research-and-analysis/digital-vaccine-labs/index.html) customers are
protected from exploitation by security filters delivered ahead of public
disclosure.

All security vulnerabilities that are acquired by the Zero Day Initiative are handled according to the [ZDI Disclosure Policy](/advisories/disclosure_policy/). Once the affected vendor patches the vulnerability, we publish an accompanying security advisory which describes the issue, including links to the vendor's fixes.

Subject: [PATCH 3/5] CVE-2021-44142: libadouble: harden ad\_unpack\_xattrs()
This ensures ad\_unpack\_xattrs() is only called for an ad\_type of ADOUBLE\_RSRC,
which is used for parsing .\_ AppleDouble sidecar files, and the buffer
ad->ad\_data is AD\_XATTR\_MAX\_HDR\_SIZE bytes large which is a prerequisite for all
buffer out-of-bounds access checks in ad\_unpack\_xattrs().

## Samba vfs\_fruit module insecurely handles extended file attributes

#### Vulnerability Note VU#119678

Original Release Date: 2022-01-31 | Last Revised: 2022-06-27

---

### Overview

The Samba [vfs\_fruit](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_fruit.8.html) module allows out-of-bounds heap read and write via extended file attributes (CVE-2021-44142). This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Description

The Samba [`vfs_fruit`](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_fruit.8.html) module uses extended file attributes (EA, xattr) to provide "...enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver." Samba with `vfs_fruit` configured allows out-of-bounds heap read and write via specially crafted extended file attributes.

For more information, see the Samba announcement for [CVE-2021-44142](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html) and bug [14914](https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14914). Also available for reference is a detailed blog post from [ZDI](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/2/1/cve-2021-44142-details-on-a-samba-code-execution-bug-demonstrated-at-pwn2own-austin).

### Impact

A remote attacker with write access to extended file attributes can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of `smbd`, typically root.

From the Samba annoucement for [CVE-2021-44142](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html):

> Access as a user that has write access to a file's extended attributes is required to exploit this vulnerability. Note that this could be a guest or unauthenticated user if such users are allowed write access to file extended attributes.

### Solution

#### Apply an update

Samba has [released](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html) versions 4.13.17, 4.14.12, and 4.15.5.

#### Disable vfs\_fruit

As a workaround, remove 'fruit' from 'vfs objects' lines in Samba configuration files (e.g., `smb.conf`).

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Orange Tsai of DEVCORE for researching and reporting this vulnerability. Thanks also to Samba, ZDI, and Western Digital for coordination efforts.

**Detail**

* CVE-2021-44142
  + Severity: Important
  + CVSS3 Base Score: 8.8
  + CVSS3 Vector: [CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.1#CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
  + The Samba vfs\_fruit module uses extended file attributes (EA, xattr) to provide "...enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver." Samba versions prior to 4.13.17, 4.14.12 and 4.15.5 with vfs\_fruit configured allow out-of-bounds heap read and write via specially crafted extended file attributes. A remote attacker with write access to extended file attributes can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of smbd, typically root.

# CVE-2021-44142: Details on a Samba Code Execution Bug Demonstrated at Pwn2Own Austin

February 01, 2022 | The ZDI Research Team

[SUBSCRIBE](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/rss/)

Recently, Samba released a patch to address an Out-of-Bounds (OOB) Heap Read/Write vulnerability found in Samba versions prior to 4.13.17. This vulnerability was disclosed at [Pwn2Own Austin 2021](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/11/1/pwn2ownaustin) by Nguyễn Hoàng Thạch  ([@hi\_im\_d4rkn3ss](https://twitter.com/hi_im_d4rkn3ss)) and Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong ([@st424204](https://twitter.com/st424204)) of STAR Labs. After the event, Lucas Leong of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative discovered additional variants of the vulnerability which were disclosed to Samba as part of this fix. This bug was also independently reported to Samba by Orange Tsai of DEVCORE.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Samba. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EA metadata in the Samba server daemon (smbd) when opening a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.

Now that the patch has been made available, let’s take a more detailed look at the bugs involved and the patch released to fix them. Much of this information was derived from the white paper submitted by STARLabs as a part of their Pwn2Own entry.

**Background**

Within Samba, the server daemon that provides the file sharing service is known as `smbd`. This analysis was conducted on `smbd` version 4.9.5, which can be downloaded [here](https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/stable/samba-4.9.5.tar.gz). While this isn’t the latest version of Samba, there are still quite a few vendors that incorporate this version or prior versions in their products. This was the case during Pwn2Own Austin 2021. Since Samba provides file sharing between devices, it is often enabled by default. The configuration of `smbd` is found in `/etc/samba/smb.conf`. Here’s a portion of an `smb.conf` file showing how Samba would be configured to support a Time Machine share for Apple devices:

In this section, you can see that `guest ok = yes` is declared, which allows guest authentication. The `vfs objects` list contains three modules: `catia`, `fruit`, and `streams_xattr`. The bugs we’re concerned with reside in the `fruit` module, which provides enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients. As stated by the vendor [advisory](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html), “The problem in `vfs_fruit` exists in the default configuration of the fruit VFS module using `fruit:metadata=netatalk` or `fruit:resource=file`. If both options are set to different settings than [sic] the default values, the system is not affected by the security issue.”

**The Vulnerability**

The `fruit` module that ships with Samba is designed to provide interoperability between Samba and [Netatalk](http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/). Netatalk is an open-source implementation of the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP). It allows Unix-like systems to serve as file servers for Apple devices. Once a session is established, `smbd` allows an unauthenticated user to set extended file attributes of a file via `SMB2_SET_INFO`. This is done by the `set_ea function` found in “source3/smbd/trans2.c”. The name of the attribute must not be within the private Samba attribute name list, which includes `user.SAMBA_PAI`, `user.DOSATTRIB`, `user.SAMBA_STREAMS`, and `security.NACL`. With the exception of these attributes, an attacker can set arbitrary extended attributes.

The `fruit` module handles requests that access a file with the stream name `:AFP_AfpInfo` or `:AFP_Resource`. If using the stream name `:AFP_AfpInfo`, an attacker can open, read, and write Netatalk metadata of a file. Netatalk metadata is stored in a `adouble` structure, which is initialized by the `ad_get`/`ad_fget` functions.

The Netatalk metadata of a file is stored in the value of the extended attribute identified by the name `org.netatalk.Metadata`. The metadata will be parsed to fill the `adouble` (AppleDouble) structure. Since `org.netatalk.Metadata` isn't in the private Samba attribute name list discussed above, an attacker can set an arbitrary value for this attribute. Therefore, it's possible for an attacker to inject malformed metadata values. This can lead to multiple out-of-bounds memory accesses when the `adouble` structure is later used.

Let’s take a more detailed look at the bugs used to exploit this vulnerability during the Pwn2Own competition.

**[ZDI-22-245](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-245/): Heap Out-Of-Bounds Read**

The `fruit_pread` function reads metadata of a file. Since our file stream is named `:AFP_AfpInfo` and the file type is `ADOUBLE_META`, the function chain `fruit_pread_meta` -> `fruit_pread_meta_adouble` will be executed.

Consider the following source code:

At line 4279, the `ad_fget` function creates an `adouble` structure containing attacker-controlled data.

At line 4285, the call to `ad_get_entry` returns the pointer to the `ADEID_FINDERI` entry. Since this is controllable by the attacker, they can make `p` point to the last byte of the `ad->data` buffer. This will cause the `memcpy` call at line 4300 to read past the end of the allocated buffer and dump up to thirty-one bytes of memory from the heap.

**[ZDI-22-246](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-246/): Heap Out-Of-Bounds Write**

The `fruit_pwrite` function is used to write metadata to a file. Since we can already control an `ADEID_FINDERI` entry, we can leverage that to control a `memcpy` call, which allows us to write up to thirty-one bytes of data to the heap.

Consider the following source code:

At line 4657, the `ad_fget` function creates the `ad` `adouble` structure from metadata. As mentioned before, an attacker could inject malformed metadata here and control the values within.

Later at line 4664, the `ad_get_entry` returns the pointer to the `ADEID_FINDERI` entry. Since this is controllable by the attacker, they can set `p` to point to the last byte of the `ad->data` buffer. This allows the `memcpy` call at line 4671 to write past the end of the `ad->ad_data` buffer. Since `ad->ad_data` is allocated from heap memory, the attacker can leverage this vulnerability to write up to 31 bytes of data past the end of the heap buffer.

**[ZDI-22-244](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-244/): Heap-based Buffer Overflow**

When analyzing the bugs used during Pwn2Own, ZDI Vulnerability Researcher Lucas Leong noticed a variant of the vulnerability used at the contest.

In the case of the bugs used during Pwn2Own, Samba fails to validate the `ADEID_FINDERI` function, which leads to an OOB read and OOB write. Further analysis from Lucas found that Samba does not validate the `ADEID_FILEDATESI` entry either. This leads to OOB read in `ad_getdate` and an OOB write in `ad_setdate`. This leads to an overflow of three bytes, as seen in the code below:

An attacker can possibly leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the `smbd` daemon.

**Patch details**

The source code of the patch for CVE-2021-44142 can be found [here](https://attachments.samba.org/attachment.cgi?id=17092). The primary change from the vendor was an update to two areas to mitigate this vulnerability.

First, Samba added the function `ad_entry_check_size()`, which validates the size of each entry when parsing the AppleDouble format.

Second, Samba added the Netatalk extended attribute `AFPINFO_EA_NETATALK` to the list of the private attribute name list. Since an attacker needs to set the malformed extended attribute on a file at the beginning stage of this exploit, this change effectively blocks any user attempting to set any Netatalk extended attribute. This is a generic mitigation for this attack vector.

**Conclusion**

Samba [patched](https://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html) this and other bugs on January 31, 2022. They assigned CVE-2021-44142 to cover the bugs discussed in this report. In addition to 4.13.17, Samba 4.14.12 and 4.15.5 have been released to address this vulnerability. The vendor does list removing the fruit VFS module from the list of configured VFS in “smb.conf” as a workaround. However, this will severely impact the functionality of any macOS systems attempting to access the Samba server. Because of this, you should focus on testing and deploying the patch to remediate this vulnerability. It’s also recommended to reach out to any third-party vendors with devices on your enterprise to ensure they have consumed the patch and provided updates to their devices as well. It is expected that many different vendors will need to update the version of Samba they ship with their devices, so expect lots of additional patches to address these bugs.

==
== CVE ID#:     CVE-2021-44142
==
== Versions:    All versions of Samba prior to 4.13.17
==
== Summary:     This vulnerability allows remote attackers to

==              installations that use the VFS module vfs_fruit.
=================================================================

===========
Description
===========

All versions of Samba prior to 4.13.17 are vulnerable to an
out-of-bounds heap read write vulnerability that allows remote
attackers to execute arbitrary code as root on affected Samba
installations that use the VFS module vfs_fruit.

The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EA metadata when
opening files in smbd. Access as a user that has write access to a
file's extended attributes is required to exploit this
vulnerability. Note that this could be a guest or unauthenticated user
if such users are allowed write access to file extended attributes.

The problem in vfs_fruit exists in the default configuration of the
fruit VFS module using fruit:metadata=netatalk or fruit:resource=file.
If both options are set to different settings than the default values,
the system is not affected by the security issue.

==================
Patch Availability
==================

Patches addressing both these issues have been posted to:

    https://www.samba.org/samba/security/

Additionally, Samba 4.13.17, 4.14.12 and 4.15.5 have been issued as
security releases to correct the defect. Samba administrators are
advised to upgrade to these releases or apply the patch as soon
as possible.

==========

As a workaround remove the "fruit" VFS module from the list of
configured VFS objects in any "vfs objects" line in the Samba
configuration smb.conf.

Note that changing the VFS module settings fruit:metadata or
fruit:resource to use the unaffected setting causes all stored
information to be inaccessible and will make it appear to macOS
clients as if the information is lost.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c0)  Ralph Böhme    2021-11-19 09:45:02 UTC  ``` Received via security@samba.org from orange@chroot.org:  Hi, I am Orange Tsai from DEVCORE Research Team, we recently found a set of vulnerabilities in the `vfs_fruit` module and would like to report to you. We have verified the behaviors on the latest version of Samba 4.15.0. We also attached the advisory and PoC. Please check them and let me know if you need any further information!  BTW, there is a vulnerability disclosure policy in our company, although it's not a hard deadline, we still hope vendors could fix bugs ASAP. Just let you know there are 90 days for you and hope you could fix that before Feb 17, 2022.  P.S. I can't find the GPG key of security@samba.org on your website so I encrypted the file with the key from <https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/samba-pubkey.asc>. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c4)  Ralph Böhme    2021-11-19 17:51:08 UTC  ``` From a quick check it seems this should be fixed by additional bound checks in ad_unpack(). I'll take a closer look next week. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c5)  Ralph Böhme    2021-11-20 15:46:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 17008](attachment.cgi?id=17008 "Possible fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17008&action=edit "Possible fix") Possible fix ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c6)  Jeremy Allison    2021-11-21 05:05:44 UTC  ``` Requested a CVE number from Red Hat product security. ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c8)  Jeremy Allison    2021-11-23 01:46:05 UTC  ``` Sorry for the delay Ralph, I'll take a look at this tomorrow. ```  [Comment 9](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c9)  Jeremy Allison    2021-11-23 18:55:12 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 17008](attachment.cgi?id=17008 "Possible fix") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17008&action=edit "Possible fix") Possible fix  Just to confirm, I've examined the fix and it looks to be correct. Check is exactly where it needs to be and should protect against any EA abuse I can see IMHO. ```  [Comment 10](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c10)  Ralph Böhme    2021-11-26 08:32:36 UTC  ``` After some more research and studying of the problematic code, I noticed that the function ad_get_entry() has a check for len == 0 and returns NULL in that case which prevents the described attack.  I wonder whether you were looking at an older Samba version that doesn't have the following commit:  3d5bf4b85f3ca120206a12b3d102aef2ead33082 vfs_fruit: replace unsafe ad_entry macro with a function   This commit is from 2017 so it's included on all currently shipping supported Samba versions 4.13, 4.14 and 4.15.  While this doesn't prevent an attack with a len value between 1 and 31, it should prevent the described attack.  Can you please check you analysis and PoC? ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c11)  Orange Tsai    2021-11-26 16:07:25 UTC  ``` Hi, I actually reproduced the bug in version 4.15.0. About the len, you can still assign the `len` to `1` and the `offset` to the `end-of-the-buffer - 1`. That also results the same OOB read/write. ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c12)  Orange Tsai    2021-11-26 16:13:41 UTC  ``` Oh, I got your point. Sorry for the inaccurate description in my advisory. It's true and the `len=0` won't work. However, my PoC use `len=1` to trigger the bug and the result is still the same OOB read/write on the latest version (4.15.0) of Samba! ```  [Comment 13](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c13)  Ralph Böhme    2021-11-26 16:30:11 UTC  ``` (In reply to Orange Tsai from [comment #12](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c12)) As said in #10 I'm aware of the fact that with eg len=1 you can bypass the len=0 check in ad_get_entry() and so mount the attack. But as the exploit description talks about len=0 and invalid reads and writes of 32 bytes in several places, I was a bit confused.  Thanks for clarifying! ```  [Comment 14](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c14)  Art Manion (dead mail address)    2021-12-09 16:21:32 UTC  ``` Hi, I'm Art Manion from the CERT/CC, and would like to discuss public disclosure plans for this vulnerability.  We understand that Samba has a disclosure process that includes notifying some Samba vendors/users and we don't want to unnecessarily interfere.  We've talked to Western Digital and ZDI, both of whom seem willing to be flexible, and DEVCORE has asked for a 2022-02-17 deadline.  CERT/CC would like to notify a broad list of vendors privately, before public disclosure.  We don't know that all of these vendors use Samba, but we consider such a broad notification to be a beneficial trade off to catch Samba vendors we were not aware of.  Again, we'd like to do this in a way/at a time that is in coordination with Samba vendor notifications.  We advertise a 45 day embargo but that does not apply here, we'll go with what the group decides and after stable patches are ready. ```  [Comment 15](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c15)  Ralph Böhme

The comment says:  +       /* +        * NB: the buffer ad->ad_data is always of size AD_XATTR_MAX_HDR_SIZE +        * bytes. If the ._ file was smaller then that the remaining data is +        * zero initialized in ad_alloc(). Therefor we don't need any buffer +        * size validation below eg before accessing the header, because in the +        * worst case we will be reading 0 bytes. +        */  Inside source3/lib/adouble.c we have:  #if AD_DATASZ_XATTR != 402 #error bad size for AD_DATASZ_XATTR #endif  #define AD_XATTR_MAX_HDR_SIZE 65536  However, if I look at ad_alloc() I see:  ------------------------------------------------------- static struct adouble *ad_alloc(TALLOC_CTX *ctx,                                 adouble_type_t type) {         int rc = 0;         size_t adsize = 0;         struct adouble *ad;          switch (type) {         case ADOUBLE_META:                 adsize = AD_DATASZ_XATTR;                 break;         case ADOUBLE_RSRC: ...                 adsize = AD_XATTR_MAX_HDR_SIZE;                 break; ...         if (adsize) {                 ad->ad_data = talloc_zero_array(ad, char, adsize); --------------------------------------------  So this looks to me that ad->ad_data can be a zero array either of size AD_DATASZ_XATTR (402) or AD_XATTR_MAX_HDR_SIZE (65536) which doesn't match the added comment.  Can you clarify the comment please ? ```  [Comment 21](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c21)  Jeremy Allison    2022-01-13 18:37:07 UTC  ``` (In reply to Jeremy Allison from [comment #20](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c20))  ad_unpack_xattrs() is called from ad_unpack() which is called from both ad_read_meta() and from ad_read_rsrc_adouble(). Either of these can be called from ad_read():  -------------------------------------------- static ssize_t ad_read_rsrc(vfs_handle_struct *handle,                             struct adouble *ad,                             const struct smb_filename *smb_fname) {         return ad_read_rsrc_adouble(handle, ad, smb_fname); }  static ssize_t ad_read(vfs_handle_struct *handle,                        struct adouble *ad,                        const struct smb_filename *smb_fname) {         switch (ad->ad_type) {         case ADOUBLE_META:                 return ad_read_meta(handle, ad, smb_fname);         case ADOUBLE_RSRC:                 return ad_read_rsrc(handle, ad, smb_fname);  --------------------------------------------  So it looks to me that ad_unpack_xattrs() can be called with ad->ad_data of size AD_DATASZ_XATTR (402) or AD_XATTR_MAX_HDR_SIZE (65536), which doesn't match the new comment.  Just trying to understand the fix, sorry :-(. ```  [Comment 22](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c22)  Jeremy Allison    2022-01-13 18:46:48 UTC  ``` The rest of the patch looks great !

Indeed, ad_unpack_xattrs() is supposed to be only called for parsing ._ AppleDouble sidecar files, but an attacked could forge an AppleDouble xattr so the current checks are not sufficient.  I've updated the patchset, replacing the problematic commit with    libadouble: harden ad_unpack_xattrs() ```  [Comment 29](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c29)  Ralph Böhme    2022-01-14 14:42:40 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 17087](attachment.cgi?id=17087 "Patch for master") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17087&action=edit "Patch for master") Patch for master ```  [Comment 30](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c30)  Ralph Böhme    2022-01-14 16:07:56 UTC  ``` Created [attachment 17088](attachment.cgi?id=17088 "CVE-2021-44142 Advisory") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17088&action=edit "CVE-2021-44142 Advisory") CVE-2021-44142 Advisory  First shot for an advisory text.

Any SMB share reachable via TCP is a vector?  I'd suggest "remote" (also in the subject, "remove code execution."  People do put their linux/netatalk NAS on the internet.  Adjust CVSS vector also, if this is not limited to adjacent.

Wrt to network-adjacent or not, well, I took this from another report on the issue we received from WD PSIRT. As SMB is typically blocked by ISPs, I guess AV:A is closer to the truth then AV:N, but I'm really by no means an expert in CVSS scoring. ```  [Comment 33](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c33)  Art Manion (dead mail address)    2022-01-14 17:43:36 UTC  ``` (In reply to Ralph Böhme from [comment #32](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c32))  I appreciate that it may be common and expected to run Samba on NAS and other "internal" systems but I'm pretty confident the CVSS spec treats this as "remote." " Adjacent" requires technical restrictions to e.g., ethernet/radio range/logical/physical proximity:  <https://www.first.org/cvss/v3.1/specification-document#2-1-1-Attack-Vector-AV>  CVSS also uses a "worst reasonable case" philosophy in general. ```  [Comment 34](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c34)  Orange Tsai    2022-01-14 17:57:12 UTC  ``` (In reply to Art Manion from [comment #31](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c31))  Yes, please use "Orange Tsai from DEVCORE" (all capitals on the company name) as the credits instead!

Inside ad_unpack_xattrs() we have (after the patch is applied):  ----------------------------------------------  803 static bool ad_unpack_xattrs(struct adouble *ad)  804 {  805         struct ad_xattr_header *h = &ad->adx_header;  806         size_t bufsize = talloc_get_size(ad->ad_data);  807         const char *p = ad->ad_data;  808         uint32_t hoff;  809         uint32_t i;  810   811         if (ad->ad_type != ADOUBLE_RSRC) {  812                 return false;  813         }  814   815         if (ad_getentrylen(ad, ADEID_FINDERI) <= ADEDLEN_FINDERI) {  816                 return true;  817         } ----------------------------------------------  The code in 815-187 is unchanged from before the patch. What does this:   815         if (ad_getentrylen(ad, ADEID_FINDERI) <= ADEDLEN_FINDERI) {  816                 return true;  817         }  do ? I don't understand why it's returning "true" if the entrylen for ADEID_FINDERI is less than or equal to ADEDLEN_FINDERI (32 bytes).  ad_unpack_xattrs() is called from ad_unpack(). ad_unpack() is called in two places.  Once here - in ad_read_rsrc_adouble()  --------------------------------------- 2386         /* Now parse entries */ 2387         ok = ad_unpack(ad, 2388                        ADEID_NUM_DOT_UND, 2389                        ad->ad_fsp->fsp_name->st.st_ex_size); 2390         if (!ok) { 2391                 DBG_ERR("invalid AppleDouble resource %s\n", 2392                         smb_fname->base_name); 2393                 errno = EINVAL; 2394                 return -1; 2395         } 2396  2397         if ((ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_FINDERI) != ADEDOFF_FINDERI_DOT_UND) 2398             || (ad_getentrylen(ad, ADEID_FINDERI) < ADEDLEN_FINDERI) 2399             || (ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_RFORK) < ADEDOFF_RFORK_DOT_UND)) 2400         { 2401                 DBG_ERR("invalid AppleDouble resource %s\n", 2402                         smb_fname->base_name); 2403                 errno = EINVAL; 2404                 return -1; 2405         } ---------------------------------------  Note here in line 2398 we check: ad_getentrylen(ad, ADEID_FINDERI) < ADEDLEN_FINDERI) and reject if so. Then why does ad_unpack_xattrs() explicitly allow (ad_getentrylen(ad, ADEID_FINDERI) <= ADEDLEN_FINDERI) ?  Second caller is in ad_read_meta():  --------------------------------------- 2179         ok = ad_unpack(ad, ADEID_NUM_XATTR, AD_DATASZ_XATTR); 2180         if (!ok) { 2181                 DEBUG(2, ("invalid AppleDouble metadata xattr\n")); 2182                 errno = EINVAL; 2183                 rc = -1; 2184                 goto exit; 2185         } 2186  2187         if (!ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_FINDERI) 2188             || !ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_COMMENT) 2189             || !ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_FILEDATESI) 2190             || !ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_AFPFILEI) 2191             || !ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_PRIVDEV) 2192             || !ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_PRIVINO) 2193             || !ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_PRIVSYN) 2194             || !ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_PRIVID)) { 2195                 DEBUG(2, ("invalid AppleDouble metadata xattr\n")); 2196                 errno = EINVAL; 2197                 rc = -1; 2198                 goto exit; 2199         } ---------------------------------------  Here we check (line 2187): if (!ad_getentryoff(ad, ADEID_FINDERI), but we don't check ad_getentrylen(ad, ADEID_FINDERI).  I guess I just don't understand these checks, or why they're different in these cases.  Sorry if I'm being really dumb, but I'd like to understand first. ```  [Comment 41](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c41)  Jeremy Allison    2022-01-14 19:31:26 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 17090](attachment.cgi?id=17090 "CVE-2021-44142 Advisory v3") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17090&action=edit "CVE-2021-44142 Advisory v3") CVE-2021-44142 Advisory v3  Sorry:  == Versions:    All versions of Samba priors to 4.13.17  needs to be:  == Versions:    All versions of Samba prior to 4.13.17  (that's why the s///g had the "g" in the regexp in the previous comment :-). ```  [Comment 42](show_bug.cgi?id=14914#c42)  Jeremy Allison    2022-01-14 19:34:19 UTC  ``` Comment on [attachment 17090](attachment.cgi?id=17090 "CVE-2021-44142 Advisory v3") [[details]](attachment.cgi?id=17090&action=edit "CVE-2021-44142 Advisory v3") CVE-2021-44142 Advisory v3  Also I'd change:  "Authentication as unprivileged user that has write access to a file's EAs is required to exploit this vulnerablity."  to:  "Access as a user that has write access to a file's extended attributes is required to exploit this vulnerability.

It's not a marshalling/security check. So if ad_getentrylen(ad, ADEID_FINDERI) is 32 or smaller we just do nothing and return success.  The sanity checks for a conforming AppleDouble data blob are now all done in ad_entry_check_size() for all AppleDouble entries, so callers can be more relaxed and just check for presence of the AppleDouble entries they expect. Iow the ad_getentrylen() check in ad_getentrylen() could in theory be removed.

## Name

vfs\_fruit — Enhanced OS X and Netatalk interoperability

## Synopsis

`vfs objects = fruit`

## DESCRIPTION

This VFS module is part of the
[samba(7)](samba.7.html) suite.

The `vfs_fruit` module provides
enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and
interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver.

The module should be stacked with
`vfs_catia` if enabling character conversion and
must be stacked with `vfs_streams_xattr`, see the
example section for the correct config.

The module enables alternate data streams (ADS) support
for a share, intercepts the OS X special streams "AFP\_AfpInfo"
and "AFP\_Resource" and handles them in a special way. All
other named streams are deferred to
`vfs_streams_xattr` which must be loaded
together with `vfs_fruit`.

Be careful when mixing shares with and without
vfs\_fruit. OS X clients negotiate SMB2 AAPL protocol
extensions on the first tcon, so mixing shares with and
without fruit will globally disable AAPL if the first tcon is
without fruit.

Having shares with ADS support enabled for OS X client
is worthwhile because it resembles the behaviour of Apple's
own SMB server implementation and it avoids certain severe
performance degradations caused by Samba's case sensitivity
semantics.

The OS X metadata and resource fork stream can be stored
in a way compatible with Netatalk 3 by setting
`fruit:resource = file` and
`fruit:metadata = netatalk`.

OS X maps NTFS illegal characters to the Unicode private
range in SMB requests. By setting `fruit:encoding =
native`, all mapped characters are converted to
native ASCII characters.

Finally, share access modes are optionally checked
against Netatalk AFP sharing modes by setting
`fruit:locking = netatalk`.

This module is not stackable other than described in
this manpage.

## GLOBAL OPTIONS

The following options must be set in the global smb.conf section
and won't take effect when set per share.

fruit:aapl = yes | no

A *global* option whether to enable Apple's SMB2+
extension codenamed AAPL. Default
*yes*. This extension enhances
several deficiencies when connecting from Macs:

* directory enumeration is enriched with
  Mac relevant filesystem metadata (UNIX mode,
  FinderInfo, resource fork size and effective
  permission), as a result the Mac client doesn't need
  to fetch this metadata individually per directory
  entry resulting in an often tremendous performance
  increase.
* The ability to query and modify the
  UNIX mode of directory entries.

There's a set of per share options that come into play when
*fruit:aapl* is enabled. These options, listed
below, can be used to disable the computation of specific Mac
metadata in the directory enumeration context, all are enabled by
default:

* readdir\_attr:aapl\_rsize = yes | no
* readdir\_attr:aapl\_finder\_info = yes | no
* readdir\_attr:aapl\_max\_access = yes | no

See below for a description of these options.

fruit:nfs\_aces = yes | no

A *global* option whether support for
querying and modifying the UNIX mode of directory entries via NFS
ACEs is enabled, default *yes*.

fruit:copyfile = yes | no

A *global* option whether to enable OS X
specific copychunk ioctl that requests a copy of a whole file
along with all attached metadata.

WARNING: the copyfile request is blocking the
client while the server does the copy.

The default is *no*.

fruit:model = MacSamba

This option defines the model string inside the AAPL
extension and will determine the appearance of the icon representing the
Samba server in the Finder window.

The default is *MacSamba*.

## OPTIONS

The following options can be set either in the global smb.conf section
or per share.

fruit:resource = [ file | xattr | stream ]

Controls where the OS X resource fork is stored.

Due to a spelling bug in all Samba versions older then
4.6.0, this option can also be given as
*fruit:ressource*, ie with two s.

Settings:

* `file (default)` - use a .\_
  AppleDouble file compatible with OS X and
  Netatalk
* `xattr` - use a
  xattr, requires a filesystem with large xattr support
  and a file IO API compatible with xattrs, this boils
  down to Solaris and derived platforms and
  ZFS
* `stream (experimental)` - pass
  the stream on to the next module in the VFS stack.
  *Warning:*  this option should not be used
  with the *streams\_xattr* module due to the
  extended attributes size limitations of most
  filesystems.
fruit:time machine = [ yes | no ]

Controls if Time Machine support via the FULLSYNC volume
capability is advertised to clients.

* `yes` - Enables Time Machine
  support for this share. Also registers the share with mDNS in
  case Samba is built with mDNS support.
* `no (default)` Disables
  advertising Time Machine support.

This option enforces the following settings per share (or
for all shares if enabled globally):

* `durable handles = yes`
* `kernel oplocks = no`
* `kernel share modes = no`
* `posix locking = no`
fruit:time machine max size = SIZE [K|M|G|T|P]

Useful for Time Machine: limits the reported disksize, thus
preventing Time Machine from using the whole real disk space for
backup. The option takes a number plus an optional unit.

*IMPORTANT*: This is an approximated
calculation that only takes into account the contents of Time
Machine sparsebundle images. Therefore you *MUST
NOT* use this volume to store other content when using
this option, because it would NOT be accounted.

The calculation works by reading the band size from the
Info.plist XML file of the sparsebundle, reading the bands/
directory counting the number of band files, and then multiplying
one with the other.

fruit:metadata = [ stream | netatalk ]

Controls where the OS X metadata stream is stored:

* `netatalk (default)` - use
  Netatalk compatible xattr
* `stream` - pass the
  stream on to the next module in the VFS
  stack
fruit:locking = [ netatalk | none ]

* `none (default)` - no
  cross protocol locking
* `netatalk` - use
  cross protocol locking with Netatalk
fruit:encoding = [ native | private ]

Controls how the set of illegal NTFS ASCII
character, commonly used by OS X clients, are stored in
the filesystem.

*Important:* this is known to not fully
work with *fruit:metadata=stream* or
*fruit:resource=stream*.

* `private (default)` -
  store characters as encoded by the OS X client: mapped
  to the Unicode private range
* `native` - store
  characters with their native ASCII
  value. *Important*: this option
  requires the use of *vfs\_catia* in
  the VFS module stack as shown in the examples
  section.
fruit:veto\_appledouble = yes | no

*Note:* this option only applies when
*`fruit:resource`* is set to
*`file`* (the default).

When *`fruit:resource`* is set to
*`file`*, vfs\_fruit may create .\_ AppleDouble
files. This options controls whether these .\_ AppleDouble files
are vetoed which prevents the client from accessing them.

Vetoing .\_ files may break some applications, e.g.
extracting Mac ZIP archives from Mac clients fails,
because they contain .\_ files. `rsync` will
also be unable to sync files beginning with underscores, as
the temporary files it uses for these will start with .\_ and
so cannot be created.

Setting this option to
false will fix this, but the abstraction leak of
exposing the internally created .\_ files may have other
unknown side effects.

The default is *yes*.

fruit:posix\_rename = yes | no

Whether to enable POSIX directory rename behaviour
for OS X clients. Without this, directories can't be
renamed if any client has any file inside it
(recursive!) open.

The default is *yes*.

readdir\_attr:aapl\_rsize = yes | no

Return resource fork size in SMB2 FIND responses.

The default is *yes*.

readdir\_attr:aapl\_finder\_info = yes | no

Return FinderInfo in SMB2 FIND responses.

The default is *yes*.

readdir\_attr:aapl\_max\_access = yes | no

Return the user's effective maximum permissions in SMB2 FIND
responses. This is an expensive computation, setting this to off
pretends the use has maximum effective permissions.

The default is *yes*.

fruit:wipe\_intentionally\_left\_blank\_rfork = yes | no

Whether to wipe Resource Fork data that matches the special
286 bytes sized placeholder blob that macOS client create on
occasion. The blob contains a string “This resource fork
intentionally left blank”, the remaining bytes being mostly
zero. There being no one use of this data, it is probably safe to
discard it. When this option is enabled, this module truncates the
Resource Fork stream to 0 bytes.

The default is *no*.

fruit:delete\_empty\_adfiles = yes | no

Whether to delete empty AppleDouble files. Empty means that
the resource fork entry in the AppleDouble files is of size 0, or
the size is exactly 286 bytes and the content matches a special
boilerplate resource fork created my macOS.

The default is *no*.

fruit:zero\_file\_id = yes | no

Whether to return zero to queries of on-disk file
identifier if the client has negotiated AAPL.

Mac applications and / or the Mac SMB client code expect the
on-disk file identifier to have the semantics of HFS+ Catalog Node
Identifier (CNID). Samba provides File-IDs based on a file's inode
number which gets recycled across file creation and deletion and
can therefor not be used for Mac client. Returning a file identifier of
zero causes the Mac client to stop using and trusting the file id
returned from the server.

The default is *yes*.

* Only [supported Samba versions](https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba_Release_Planning "Samba Release Planning") are eligible for a security release.
* Security updates, once public, are listed on [Samba Security Releases](https://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html)
* Security issues that are assigned a CVE can be found in [The Samba Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.samba.org/buglist.cgi?f1=alias&o1=regexp&order=Last%20Changed&product=PIDL&product=Samba%202.2&product=Samba%203.0&product=Samba%203.2&product=Samba%203.3&product=Samba%203.4&product=Samba%203.5&product=Samba%203.6&product=Samba%204.0&product=Samba%204.1%20and%20newer&query_format=advanced&v1=^CVE-.*). This will also include some minor issues that do not warrant a full security release.

# Reporting Security Defects in Samba

Please report all security issues or defects in Samba or concerning our infrastructure to **security@samba.org** and ***never on*** [IRC](https://www.samba.org/samba/irc.html), [public mailing lists](https://www.samba.org/samba/archives.html) or in [Bugzilla](https://bugzilla.samba.org)!

*For clarity, a Samba Team member will create the private Bugzilla issue mentioned below.*

## Some specific things not to report to Samba

* Samba is a public open source project, so we have a public gitweb instance at <https://git.samba.org>. This is intentional, please do not report this (again).
* HTTP Headers on <https://www.samba.org> and <https://download.samba.org> websites. Our main website is static, not dynamic nor a content management system.
* Directory listings on <https://ftp.samba.org> and <https://download.samba.org> are intentional.
* The private keys and network captures under <https://www.samba.org/~metze/caps>, in particular at <https://www.samba.org/~metze/caps/krb5/pkinit/manage-ca/CA-w4edom-l4.base/Private/> are intentionally public samples.

# A public security process for Samba

The following process is followed by **the [Samba Team Member](https://www.samba.org/samba/team) working on the security issue**.

We publish it as a service to the Free Software and broader software development community as a well-worked, practical process for *responsible disclosure* and to our aid our Samba community in knowing how we handle serious security issues in our code.

```
Security issues are usually reported via security@samba.org.

1.) Someone should feel responsible and make sure that it's really a
    security defect. If yes, we need one person who is responsible for
    this specific issue beyond this point. This person coordinates the
    further actions and might delegate tasks, of course.

2.) Create a bug report with limited access to "Samba core developers"
    only!  This is done by selecting 'Show advanced fields' and at the
    very bottom:

   'Only users in all of the selected groups can view this bug:

    [x] Samba Core Developers

2a.) Change the summary so that it starts with "[EMBARGOED][SECURITY]"

    For example:

    "[EMBARGOED][SECURITY] dsdb: time wrap at end of unix time

2b.) Add all information including reproducer etc. to the bug report.

3.) Write an initial advisory and attach it to the bug report. A
    template is available here:
    team-info/doc/releases/template_security_advisory.txt

3a.) Confirm with the initial reporter that they are willing to be
     publicly thanked and any affiliation they wish to have noted.

4.) Do a CVSSv3.1 calculation ([2]) and add it to the bug report and the
    advisory.

4a.) Stop and ask for advise on security@samba.org if the CVSSv3.1
     score is less than 5.0.  This is a heavy-weight process with
     costs to many parties.

4b.) Even for a CVSSv3.1 of more than 5.0 we do not do a security
     release where the impact is:

     * Only a Denial of Service (not a use after free) and the
       automated internal process restart will allow other clients to
       reconnect eventually.

       For clarity, the shared LDAP or KDC process in the AD DC will
       restart, so a simple NULL de-reference crash there would not
       trigger a release.  However a similar issue in the main smbd
       listener preventing new connections being established may
       require a release.

       This is similar to, but an extension of, our existing rule that
       crashing the smbd belonging to the connecting user is not a
       DoS.

     * Mitigated by the selection of strong passwords.

       We will not do a security release simply because weak passwords
       are permitted to be selected (eg our password policy tools fail
       to exclude all weak passwords) or a weak password can be brute
       forced online (eg avoiding a bad password lockout).

     These issues are real, important and should be backported to
     maintained releases, but do not justify the costs of coordinated
     disclosure or a seperate security release.

     However, we do:
      - ask for a CVE (step 5.)
      - place the CVE on the bug (step 5b.)
      - leave or make the bug public (step 14. and 14a.)
      - mark the commits with the CVE (step 6a.)

4c.) In general we do not take security release steps at all where the
     issue is:

     * Samba's historical acceptence of now-weak cryptography

       Unless of course a new novel attack is found, rather than just
       the slow march of time.

     * Reliant on a timing attack

       For example newer Samba versions use a constant-time memcmp()
       from GnuTLS.  The failure of this to be constant-time or the
       lack of use of constant-time methods in a particular place will
       just be fixed normally.

     * User enumeration / username discovery

       It is assumed that in our deployed environments usernames are
       available to an attacker.  In the AD DC Kerberos will readily
       confirm that a user does or does not exist.

     * Relient on offline brute force of a weak password

       The NTLM challenge response and Kerberos traffic (without FAST,
       which is rare) is well known to expose a user's password to a
       brute force attack.

     However do ask for advise on security@samba.org if you feel
     concerned that any particular issue may be an exception.

5.) Ask for a CVE (usually Red Hat Product Security
    <secalert@redhat.com> does help out on this one).

To:      Red Hat Product Security <secalert@redhat.com>
Subject: Another Samba CVE (bug XXXX)

Red Hat Product Security,

Can I please get a CVE for what will be Samba Bugzilla:
https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14706

The Samba team has evaluated this issue and determined that it will
require a CVE per our process.
https://wiki.samba.org/index.php/Samba_Security_Process

Details are confidential for now, but will be clearly marked with that
bug (so you can connect the threads once vendors are notified or the
issue is made public).

Thanks!

    If the bug is already public, remove
     "are confidential for now, but "
    and feel free to describe the issue in cleartext.

    DO NOT attach the advisory from step 3.  This avoids two issues:
     - If Red Hat gets the advisory, they need to get GDPR permission for
       the reporter name and we don't want to block on the back and forth
       for that (see 3a).
     - It keeps all vendors on the same basis.

     See [1] for GPG key etc if the circumstances require it (if for
     example you do feel the need to disclose details or seek detailed
     advice).

5b.) If for any reason Red Hat is unable to assist with obtaining a
     CVE number in time, the backup process is to fill in this form
     https://cveform.mitre.org/ (explain the situation in the
     submission)

5c.) After receiving the CVE number, please add it as an
     alias (this is a seperate bugzilla field) on the bug report
     and to the summary (title), eg:
     CVE-2038-12345 [EMBARGOED][SECURITY]...

6.) Write patches and tests and add them to the bug report.  Mark them
    WIP in the description until they are 'final'.
    (Even 'final' patches may change after being subject to review of
    course).

6a.) ALL commits in the patch should have a CVE prefix and a BUG tag eg:

  CVE-2038-12345 dsdb: time wrap at end of unix time

  At time_t rollover all AD security is lost due to integer wrap on
  32-bit systems

  BUG: https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=999999

  Signed-off-by: Time Lord <time@samba.org>

6b.) Ask for early review of your WIP and final master patches ASAP

6c.) Prepare backports for all affected and supported versions

     (1 file per version, even if identical).

     Files should be named $CVE-$DESCRIPTION-$MAJOR-$VERSION.patch

     E.g.:
     CVE-2018-14629-timewrap-4.9-01.patch

6d.) Run *private* autobuild (see doc/autobuild.txt) or *private*
     Gitlab CI for each CVE and each maintained branch.  (This allows
     the release manager to defer some patches if problems appear
     later in the process).

6e.) Mark the patch that has passed with the ci-passed flag in the
     bugzilla attachment details.

6f.) Once each CVE patch and branch has passed, ask for review ASAP.

6g.) Get one explicit review flag in Bugzilla (yours, as a team member,
     is implicit and CI passed is now a distinct flag).

7.) Once all patches and the advisory are available and reviewed, ask
    the release manager for a release date.

7a.) Between now and the release, the release manager or their
     delegate will run a *private* autobuild of the exact combination
     of patches the be released.

7b.) If multiple issues are being released in a batch, create a
     tracking bug that is blocked by the CVEs to be addressed in this
     bundle.

8.) Finish the advisory and attach it to the bug report as
    advisory-$CVE.txt.  Ask for review.  (This must be after getting
    the release date so the correct version numbers can be included).

9.) ~10 days before the release date, confirm every patch and the CVE
    text still has the correct reviews (due to additional feedback for
    example).

9a.) add samba-vendor to the CC list in the bug report,

9b.) open the bug report by checking "Core developers, and Vendors
     shipping Samba as part of their products" and removing "Samba
     Core Developers".

9c.) Add the planned release date to the bug or the tracking bug if
     that has been created.  This will be the first useful e-mail seen
     by our vendors.

10.) 7 days before the release date, send an e-mail to
     samba@lists.samba.org, samba-technical@lists.samba.org and
     samba-announce@lists.samba.org indicating there will be a security
     release and the broad component it impacts.  This is to allow
     large installations time to prepare for security patching.

     For example:

To:	 samba-announce@lists.samba.org
Cc:	 Upstream Samba Technical Mailing list <samba-technical@lists.samba.org>, samba@lists.samba.org
Subject: Heads-up: Security Releases ahead!
Hi,

this is a heads-up that there will be Samba security updates on
Tuesday, XXXXX YYth. Please make sure that your Samba
servers will be updated soon after the release!

Impacted components:
 - AD DC (CVSS 7.5, High)
 - client (CVSS 5.9, Medium)
 - file server / classic DC (CVSS 6.8 Medium)

10a.) Note that this represents the final GO/NO-GO point.  In order to
      facilitate creation of tarballs etc, after this date the patches
      and CVE text *must not change* or else the release will need to
      be publicly rescheduled, patches dropped or other appropriate
      action taken at the absolute discretion of the release manager.

11.) The release manager or their delegate will prepare the tarballs
     in the *stable* branches:
    - git fetch
    - git rebase
    - git merge -ff-only the VERSION bump commit from the corresponding test
      branch
    - apply the security patchset
    - WHATSNEW.txt: add the release notes
    - VERSION: disable GIT_SNAPSHOT
    - add an empty announce.samba-$VERSION.quotation.txt file
    - GNUPGHOME=$PATH_TO_THE_RELEASE_KEY script/release.sh samba-stable create
    DO NOT PUBLISH ANYTHING BEFORE THE END OF EMBARGO!

    On the release day:
    Upload the files and publish the announcements as described in steps
    3.) and 4.) in team-info/doc/releases/howto_releases.txt

12.) Additional steps for the release manager:
     - upload the signed security patch(es) to the ftp server:
       samba-bugs@samba.org:/home/ftp/pub/samba/patches/security/
     - push the advisory to the samba-web git repository:
       samba-web/security/
     - update samba-web/history/security.html

     Merge the tags to the test branches:
     - git fetch
     - git rebase
     - git merge $TAG
     - VERSION: bump version
     - push without autobuild:
       LC_SAMBA_AUTOBUILD_PUSH=1 git push-v4-X-test-skip-autobuild

13.) After shipping the releases, the responsible person must make
     sure that the patches find their way into the master branch and
     remove the [EMBARGOED] tag from the bug report.

14.) Mark as 'private' any sensitive comments or attachments

14a.) Then un-select the "Core developers, and Vendors shipping Samba
      as part of their products" restriction.

15.) Address any minor improvements that were suggested after the
     patches were frozen and incorporate those into commits in master.

16.) Close out bug report when patches have been pushed to *all* relevant
     branches.

17.) Now that any regressions etc will have been broadly noticed,
     remove samba-vendor from the CC list of the now public bug, ask
     that they subscribe individually if still interested.

# CVE-2021-44142: Details on a Samba Code Execution Bug Demonstrated at Pwn2Own Austin

February 01, 2022 | The ZDI Research Team

[SUBSCRIBE](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/rss/)

Recently, Samba released a patch to address an Out-of-Bounds (OOB) Heap Read/Write vulnerability found in Samba versions prior to 4.13.17. This vulnerability was disclosed at [Pwn2Own Austin 2021](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2021/11/1/pwn2ownaustin) by Nguyễn Hoàng Thạch  ([@hi\_im\_d4rkn3ss](https://twitter.com/hi_im_d4rkn3ss)) and Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong ([@st424204](https://twitter.com/st424204)) of STAR Labs. After the event, Lucas Leong of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative discovered additional variants of the vulnerability which were disclosed to Samba as part of this fix. This bug was also independently reported to Samba by Orange Tsai of DEVCORE.

This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Samba. Authentication is not required to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw exists within the parsing of EA metadata in the Samba server daemon (smbd) when opening a file. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of root.

Now that the patch has been made available, let’s take a more detailed look at the bugs involved and the patch released to fix them. Much of this information was derived from the white paper submitted by STARLabs as a part of their Pwn2Own entry.

**Background**

Within Samba, the server daemon that provides the file sharing service is known as `smbd`. This analysis was conducted on `smbd` version 4.9.5, which can be downloaded [here](https://download.samba.org/pub/samba/stable/samba-4.9.5.tar.gz). While this isn’t the latest version of Samba, there are still quite a few vendors that incorporate this version or prior versions in their products. This was the case during Pwn2Own Austin 2021. Since Samba provides file sharing between devices, it is often enabled by default. The configuration of `smbd` is found in `/etc/samba/smb.conf`. Here’s a portion of an `smb.conf` file showing how Samba would be configured to support a Time Machine share for Apple devices:

In this section, you can see that `guest ok = yes` is declared, which allows guest authentication. The `vfs objects` list contains three modules: `catia`, `fruit`, and `streams_xattr`. The bugs we’re concerned with reside in the `fruit` module, which provides enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients. As stated by the vendor [advisory](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html), “The problem in `vfs_fruit` exists in the default configuration of the fruit VFS module using `fruit:metadata=netatalk` or `fruit:resource=file`. If both options are set to different settings than [sic] the default values, the system is not affected by the security issue.”

**The Vulnerability**

The `fruit` module that ships with Samba is designed to provide interoperability between Samba and [Netatalk](http://netatalk.sourceforge.net/). Netatalk is an open-source implementation of the Apple Filing Protocol (AFP). It allows Unix-like systems to serve as file servers for Apple devices. Once a session is established, `smbd` allows an unauthenticated user to set extended file attributes of a file via `SMB2_SET_INFO`. This is done by the `set_ea function` found in “source3/smbd/trans2.c”. The name of the attribute must not be within the private Samba attribute name list, which includes `user.SAMBA_PAI`, `user.DOSATTRIB`, `user.SAMBA_STREAMS`, and `security.NACL`. With the exception of these attributes, an attacker can set arbitrary extended attributes.

The `fruit` module handles requests that access a file with the stream name `:AFP_AfpInfo` or `:AFP_Resource`. If using the stream name `:AFP_AfpInfo`, an attacker can open, read, and write Netatalk metadata of a file. Netatalk metadata is stored in a `adouble` structure, which is initialized by the `ad_get`/`ad_fget` functions.

The Netatalk metadata of a file is stored in the value of the extended attribute identified by the name `org.netatalk.Metadata`. The metadata will be parsed to fill the `adouble` (AppleDouble) structure. Since `org.netatalk.Metadata` isn't in the private Samba attribute name list discussed above, an attacker can set an arbitrary value for this attribute. Therefore, it's possible for an attacker to inject malformed metadata values. This can lead to multiple out-of-bounds memory accesses when the `adouble` structure is later used.

Let’s take a more detailed look at the bugs used to exploit this vulnerability during the Pwn2Own competition.

**[ZDI-22-245](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-245/): Heap Out-Of-Bounds Read**

The `fruit_pread` function reads metadata of a file. Since our file stream is named `:AFP_AfpInfo` and the file type is `ADOUBLE_META`, the function chain `fruit_pread_meta` -> `fruit_pread_meta_adouble` will be executed.

Consider the following source code:

At line 4279, the `ad_fget` function creates an `adouble` structure containing attacker-controlled data.

At line 4285, the call to `ad_get_entry` returns the pointer to the `ADEID_FINDERI` entry. Since this is controllable by the attacker, they can make `p` point to the last byte of the `ad->data` buffer. This will cause the `memcpy` call at line 4300 to read past the end of the allocated buffer and dump up to thirty-one bytes of memory from the heap.

**[ZDI-22-246](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-246/): Heap Out-Of-Bounds Write**

The `fruit_pwrite` function is used to write metadata to a file. Since we can already control an `ADEID_FINDERI` entry, we can leverage that to control a `memcpy` call, which allows us to write up to thirty-one bytes of data to the heap.

Consider the following source code:

At line 4657, the `ad_fget` function creates the `ad` `adouble` structure from metadata. As mentioned before, an attacker could inject malformed metadata here and control the values within.

Later at line 4664, the `ad_get_entry` returns the pointer to the `ADEID_FINDERI` entry. Since this is controllable by the attacker, they can set `p` to point to the last byte of the `ad->data` buffer. This allows the `memcpy` call at line 4671 to write past the end of the `ad->ad_data` buffer. Since `ad->ad_data` is allocated from heap memory, the attacker can leverage this vulnerability to write up to 31 bytes of data past the end of the heap buffer.

**[ZDI-22-244](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/advisories/ZDI-22-244/): Heap-based Buffer Overflow**

When analyzing the bugs used during Pwn2Own, ZDI Vulnerability Researcher Lucas Leong noticed a variant of the vulnerability used at the contest.

In the case of the bugs used during Pwn2Own, Samba fails to validate the `ADEID_FINDERI` function, which leads to an OOB read and OOB write. Further analysis from Lucas found that Samba does not validate the `ADEID_FILEDATESI` entry either. This leads to OOB read in `ad_getdate` and an OOB write in `ad_setdate`. This leads to an overflow of three bytes, as seen in the code below:

An attacker can possibly leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the `smbd` daemon.

**Patch details**

The source code of the patch for CVE-2021-44142 can be found [here](https://attachments.samba.org/attachment.cgi?id=17092). The primary change from the vendor was an update to two areas to mitigate this vulnerability.

First, Samba added the function `ad_entry_check_size()`, which validates the size of each entry when parsing the AppleDouble format.

Second, Samba added the Netatalk extended attribute `AFPINFO_EA_NETATALK` to the list of the private attribute name list. Since an attacker needs to set the malformed extended attribute on a file at the beginning stage of this exploit, this change effectively blocks any user attempting to set any Netatalk extended attribute. This is a generic mitigation for this attack vector.

**Conclusion**

Samba [patched](https://www.samba.org/samba/history/security.html) this and other bugs on January 31, 2022. They assigned CVE-2021-44142 to cover the bugs discussed in this report. In addition to 4.13.17, Samba 4.14.12 and 4.15.5 have been released to address this vulnerability. The vendor does list removing the fruit VFS module from the list of configured VFS in “smb.conf” as a workaround. However, this will severely impact the functionality of any macOS systems attempting to access the Samba server. Because of this, you should focus on testing and deploying the patch to remediate this vulnerability. It’s also recommended to reach out to any third-party vendors with devices on your enterprise to ensure they have consumed the patch and provided updates to their devices as well. It is expected that many different vendors will need to update the version of Samba they ship with their devices, so expect lots of additional patches to address these bugs.

Thanks again to Nguyễn Hoàng Thạch ([@hi\_im\_d4rkn3ss](https://twitter.com/hi_im_d4rkn3ss)) and Billy Jheng Bing-Jhong ([@st424204](https://twitter.com/st424204)) of STAR Labs for participating in Pwn2Own Austin 2021 and demonstrating this bug. At the contest, they won $45,000 from this exploit alone, and a total of $113,500 for the entire event. We certainly hope to see them at future competitions.

## Samba vfs\_fruit module insecurely handles extended file attributes

#### Vulnerability Note VU#119678

Original Release Date: 2022-01-31 | Last Revised: 2022-06-27

---

### Overview

The Samba [vfs\_fruit](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_fruit.8.html) module allows out-of-bounds heap read and write via extended file attributes (CVE-2021-44142). This vulnerability allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges.

### Description

The Samba [`vfs_fruit`](https://www.samba.org/samba/docs/current/man-html/vfs_fruit.8.html) module uses extended file attributes (EA, xattr) to provide "...enhanced compatibility with Apple SMB clients and interoperability with a Netatalk 3 AFP fileserver." Samba with `vfs_fruit` configured allows out-of-bounds heap read and write via specially crafted extended file attributes.

For more information, see the Samba announcement for [CVE-2021-44142](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html) and bug [14914](https://bugzilla.samba.org/show_bug.cgi?id=14914). Also available for reference is a detailed blog post from [ZDI](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/blog/2022/2/1/cve-2021-44142-details-on-a-samba-code-execution-bug-demonstrated-at-pwn2own-austin).

### Impact

A remote attacker with write access to extended file attributes can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of `smbd`, typically root.

From the Samba annoucement for [CVE-2021-44142](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html):

> Access as a user that has write access to a file's extended attributes is required to exploit this vulnerability. Note that this could be a guest or unauthenticated user if such users are allowed write access to file extended attributes.

### Solution

#### Apply an update

Samba has [released](https://www.samba.org/samba/security/CVE-2021-44142.html) versions 4.13.17, 4.14.12, and 4.15.5.

#### Disable vfs\_fruit

As a workaround, remove 'fruit' from 'vfs objects' lines in Samba configuration files (e.g., `smb.conf`).

### Acknowledgements

Thanks to Orange Tsai of DEVCORE for researching and reporting this vulnerability. Thanks also to Samba, ZDI, and Western Digital for coordination efforts.
