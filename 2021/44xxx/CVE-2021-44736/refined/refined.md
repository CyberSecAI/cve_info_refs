Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-44736:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The initial admin account setup wizard on Lexmark devices does not restrict access to the "out of service erase" feature. This means that during the initial setup phase of the device, the "out of service erase" functionality is accessible without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper access controls on the "out of service erase" feature during the initial device setup. This allows unauthenticated users to trigger the feature.
*   **Unprotected API:** The vulnerability exists within URL handling and stems from the lack of proper restriction to a URL which allows an attacker to bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Device Reset:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability leads to the device being reset to its factory default settings.
*   **Configuration Loss:** All configuration information, including security access controls, network settings, and user data, are wiped from the device.
*   **Denial of Service:** By resetting the device an attacker can cause a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Network Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker who has network access to the Lexmark printer.
*   **URL Manipulation:** The specific flaw is located within the handling of URLs. By manipulating the URL an attacker can bypass authentication and trigger the "out of service erase" feature.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable Lexmark printer.
*   **No Authentication:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials or user accounts to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability can be triggered without authentication.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The ZDI advisory provides more technical details stating that the vulnerability can be used to execute code in the context of root.
*   Lexmark has provided a workaround which includes steps to properly configure function access control settings on both modern and older devices to prevent unauthenticated access to the "out of service erase" feature.
