Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-44679:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `EVTaskGuardian.exe` component of Veritas Enterprise Vault. This lack of validation allows for the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is the application's failure to sanitize or validate data before deserialization. This flaw opens the door for attackers to inject malicious serialized objects.
*   **.NET Remoting Service Vulnerability:** The application uses .NET Remoting TCP ports that are vulnerable by nature. These services are used for communication between client applications and the server.
*   **Insecure Default Configurations**: The product uses random TCP ports for .NET Remoting. These are predictable and can be attacked if firewalls are not configured correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Enterprise Vault server. This code executes within the context of the "Enterprise Vault Task Controller Service".
*   **Full System Compromise:** Due to the ability to execute arbitrary code, a successful attack could result in a complete compromise of the server, leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based Attack:** The vulnerability is network accessible and does not require authentication, which allows an attacker to send malicious data to the server remotely.
*   **.NET Remoting:** The attack vector is through the .NET Remoting TCP ports used by the Enterprise Vault application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target Enterprise Vault server.
*   **Knowledge of Server Details:** The attacker needs to know the IP address of the server, process IDs, TCP ports, and the URIs of the remote objects exposed by the service.
*   **Firewall Bypass (Potentially):** The attacker needs to be able to reach the vulnerable ports if the firewall on the server is not properly configured.
*   **RDP access:** It is mentioned in the Veritas advisory that the attacker needs RDP access to one of the VMs on the network that is part of the Remote Desktop Users group, and the RDP access to the server itself is not a requirement.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in `EVTaskGuardian.exe`
*   The vulnerability does not require authentication
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 9.8 (Critical)
*   Multiple versions of the product are affected.
