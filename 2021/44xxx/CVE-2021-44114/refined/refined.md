Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-44114

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization when creating a new user, specifically within the "First name" field. The application fails to prevent the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS due to the failure to sanitize user-supplied input. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is stored in the database and executed when the affected page is rendered.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Cookie Stealing:** An attacker could steal a user's cookies, which can be used to gain unauthorized access to the victim's account.
*   **Account Takeover:** By stealing cookies, attackers can potentially hijack user sessions and take over accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User Input:** The attack vector is through the "First name" field when creating a new user in the application.
*  **Malicious Payload:** An attacker injects a malicious XSS payload (e.g., “><body/onload=alert(1)>”) into the vulnerable field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to User Creation Functionality:** The attacker needs to have the ability to access the functionality to add new users, which implies they must have admin privileges in this case.
*   **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs knowledge of XSS vulnerabilities and how to craft malicious payloads.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable version is identified as 1.0 of the "Stock Management System in PHP/OOP" available from sourcecodester.com.
*   The vulnerability is triggered when a user views the page where the malicious data is stored.
