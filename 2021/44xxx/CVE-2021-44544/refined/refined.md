This document provides information about multiple vulnerabilities in Delta Electronics' DIAEnergie software, including CVE-2021-44544.

**CVE-2021-44544 Details:**

*   **Vulnerability:** Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')
*   **CWE:** CWE-79
*   **Root Cause:** The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input to the `name` parameter of the `HandlerEnergyType.ashx` script.
*  **Weakness:** The software is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting (XSS). An attacker can inject arbitrary code via the vulnerable parameter.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network. An attacker sends a crafted request containing malicious JavaScript in the name parameter of the `/DataHandler/HandlerEnergyType.ashx` endpoint.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within a user's browser session, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the application.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated and can execute the attack remotely (no special capabilities are needed).

**Summary of other vulnerabilities mentioned in the document:**

The document details other vulnerabilities in the same product:

*   **CVE-2021-33003:** Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort. Weak hashing algorithm allows for password retrieval in clear text.
*   **CVE-2021-32967:** Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel. Allows for the addition of new admin user without authentication.
*   **CVE-2021-32955:** Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type. Allows an attacker to upload files and remotely execute code.
*   **CVE-2021-32983, CVE-2021-38390, CVE-2021-38391, CVE-2021-38393:** Multiple SQL Injection vulnerabilities in different endpoints. Allows execution of arbitrary code in the context of NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER.
*   **CVE-2021-32991:** Cross-site Request Forgery (CSRF). Allows an attacker to force a user to unintentionally carry out actions on the application.
*   **CVE-2021-23228:** Cross-site scripting vulnerability through error pages. Allows injection of arbitrary code in error pages.
*   **CVE-2021-31558, CVE-2021-44471:** Multiple stored XSS vulnerabilities, allowing injection of arbitrary code in multiple parameters of different scripts.
*    **CVE-2022-0988:** Cleartext Transmission of Sensitive Information. The web application runs on HTTP by default, which could allow eavesdropping.

**Affected Products:**

*   DIAEnergie: All versions prior to 1.9

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to version 1.9 or later.
*   Minimize network exposure.
*   Locate control system networks behind firewalls.
*   Use secure methods such as VPNs for remote access.
