- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow occurs due to a vulnerability in the `ok_png_read_data` function when handling PNG files with multiple IHDR chunks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-buffer-overflow
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability can lead to a crash (Aborted core dump) and potentially other undefined behavior.
- **Attack vectors**: By providing a specially crafted PNG file, an attacker can trigger the heap-buffer-overflow while processing the file using the vulnerable `ok_png_read` function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious PNG file to the vulnerable application.
