- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The JTTK library in affected products contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability. This occurs when parsing specially crafted JT files, which causes a write operation beyond the boundaries of an allocated structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a maliciously crafted JT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious JT file using an affected product.
