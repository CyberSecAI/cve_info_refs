The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability, which is related to CVE-2021-44567

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application insufficiently sanitizes user input, specifically HTTP POST parameter keys, before using them in SQL queries. The application sanitizes the `$_REQUEST` array but does not automatically sanitize the `$_GET` and `$_POST` arrays. Additionally, it only sanitizes parameter values, not keys.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unauthenticated SQL Injection. User-supplied data from `$_POST` keys is directly injected into SQL queries without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This can lead to:
  - Creating new tables.
  - Modifying existing data (e.g., changing administrator passwords).
  - Potentially reading sensitive data through error-based SQL injections, though this is not explicitly detailed in the proof of concept.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to `/ProgramFunctions/PortalPollsNotes.fnc.php` with a malicious payload in the key of the `votes` array.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.
