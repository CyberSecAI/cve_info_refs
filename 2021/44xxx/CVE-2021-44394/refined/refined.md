The provided content is related to **CVE-2021-44394**.

**Summary:**
Multiple denial-of-service vulnerabilities exist in the cgiserver.cgi JSON command parser functionality of Reolink RLC-410W devices. These vulnerabilities arise from improper input validation when parsing JSON commands, specifically when the `param` field within a command is not a JSON object as expected. This can lead to an assertion failure, causing the `cgiserver.cgi` process to crash and reboot the device.

**Root Cause:**
The root cause is improper input validation in the `cgiserver.cgi` process when handling JSON commands. The code assumes that the "param" field in a JSON command is always a JSON object and attempts to access it using the subscription operator. When a different type of JSON element (like a string) is provided, this assumption fails leading to an assertion failure.

**Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-20 - Improper Input Validation:** The code does not properly validate the type of JSON element received in the "param" field.
*   The code assumes the `param` element is always a JSON object, leading to an assert when it is not the case

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit results in a denial of service. The `cgiserver.cgi` process crashes due to an assertion failure which leads to device reboot. This disrupts the camera's functionality and potentially affects surveillance capabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP POST request with a JSON body to the `/cgi-bin/api.cgi` endpoint. The JSON body contains a command with the "param" field set to a non-object value, like an empty string `""`. This triggers the improper input validation and causes the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the camera.
*   For most of the listed vulnerabilities, the attacker needs to be authenticated, but it's possible to use a different vulnerability (TALOS-2021-1420) to bypass the authentication.
*   Specifically, for CVE-2021-44354, no authentication is needed.

**Specific Details for CVE-2021-44394:**
*   **Vulnerability Name:** GetOsd param is not object
*   The `GetOsd` command's JSON parameter parser assumes the "param" field is an object. When it receives a string (e.g., ""), it causes a crash in the `cgiserver.cgi` process and reboots the device.

**Example Exploit (for CVE-2021-44394):**

```
curl --request POST \
     --data "[{\"cmd\": \"GetOsd\",\"action\": 0,\"param\":  \"\"}]" \
     http://<CAMERA_IP>/cgi-bin/api.cgi\?cmd\=GetOsd&token\=<SESSION_TOKEN>
```
