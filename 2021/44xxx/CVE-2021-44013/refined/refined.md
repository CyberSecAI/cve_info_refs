Based on the provided documents, here's the relevant information regarding CVE-2021-44013:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of JT files within the `DL180pdfl.dll` component. Specifically, crafted data within a JT file can trigger a write past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability (CWE-787). The vulnerability occurs because the software writes data beyond the allocated buffer, corrupting memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Siemens JT2Go.
- The vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- The application may crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a maliciously crafted JT file. An attacker must trick a user into opening such a file using the vulnerable application.
- User interaction is required. The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Attackers need the ability to create a malicious JT file.
- Attackers require the user to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page hosting the exploit via the application.
