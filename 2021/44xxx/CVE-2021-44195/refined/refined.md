The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44195.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read, which can occur when the software attempts to access a memory location outside the boundaries of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation, which in this case is considered "moderate" in terms of severity. However, the CVSS score of 3.3 indicates a low impact in confidentiality, integrity, and availability, according to the specified vector (CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N)

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning an attacker needs to have local access to the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable machine. No privileges are required (PR:N), but user interaction is required (UI:R), as the user would need to open a malformed file in After Effects to trigger the vulnerability. The scope is unchanged (S:U).
