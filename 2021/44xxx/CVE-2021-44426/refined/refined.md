The provided content discusses CVE-2021-44426.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability arises from a flaw in AnyDesk's file transfer mechanism when multiple users are connected to the same remote session. Specifically, when one user copies a file from the remote machine to their local machine, this file is also copied to the other users' local machines without their explicit consent.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unintended file duplication: Files copied by one user in a shared AnyDesk session are automatically copied to other users' devices.
- Lack of user notification/approval: The file transfer to the secondary users' machines occurs silently, without any prompt or request for approval from them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Malicious file planting: An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to plant malicious files on a victim's computer without the victim's awareness or consent.
- Subsequent compromise: The planted malicious files can be used to compromise the victim's machine through subsequent attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- Shared remote session: The attack requires the presence of at least two users in the same AnyDesk remote session.
- File transfer: The attacker initiates a file transfer from the remote machine to their local machine.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a shared AnyDesk session with at least one other victim.
- The attacker needs access to a remote system that contains the malicious file.
- The attacker needs to initiate the file copy operation within the shared session.
