Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44029:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a deserialization exploitation within the `RadAsyncUpload` function of ASP.NET AJAX.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The `RadAsyncUpload` function is vulnerable to deserialization attacks. This means that an attacker can potentially inject malicious serialized data, which, when deserialized by the application, can lead to code execution.
*   **Dependency on known encryption keys**: The exploit relies on the attacker knowing the encryption keys used by the application

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker can send crafted requests containing malicious serialized data to the vulnerable `RadAsyncUpload` function via HTTP.
*   **Exploitation of Known Keys:** Requires knowledge of the application's encryption keys, this may be achieved through other vulnerabilities (CVE-2017-11317, CVE-2017-11357).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server hosting the vulnerable application.
*   **Knowledge of Encryption Keys:** The attacker must know the encryption keys to successfully exploit this vulnerability. This knowledge can be gained through other exploits.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability exists in versions of Quest Desktop Authority prior to 11.2.
*   The vulnerability is related to the `RadAsyncUpload` functionality in ASP.NET AJAX.
*   Modern versions of ASP.NET AJAX have a type whitelisting feature that mitigates this issue by default.
*   The provided content also lists other vulnerabilities affecting the same product: CVE-2021-44028, CVE-2021-44030, and CVE-2021-44031.
