Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44145:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `TransformXML` processor's ability to process XSLT files. If an XSLT file contains malicious external entity calls, it can lead to information disclosure. The vulnerability lies in the lack of secure processing of the XSLT file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is the susceptibility to XXE attacks. By crafting malicious XSLT files with external entity references, attackers can potentially access sensitive information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the disclosure of sensitive information through the resolution of external entities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious XSLT File:** An attacker crafts a malicious XSLT file containing external entity references.
*   **Configuration:** An authenticated user configures the `TransformXML` processor to use the malicious XSLT file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to configure the `TransformXML` processor.
*   **Ability to Configure XSLT:** The attacker needs the capability to specify the XSLT file used by the `TransformXML` processor.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix involves applying the "Secure processing property" to the configured XSLT file, preventing external entity resolution.
*   The vulnerability is present in Apache NiFi versions 0.1.0 to 1.15.0, and it is fixed in version 1.15.1.
