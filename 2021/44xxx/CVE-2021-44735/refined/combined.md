# Lexmark Security Advisories

## Security advisories for Lexmark devices

Lexmarkâs ultimate goal is to produce software and hardware that is free from security-related vulnerabilities, however, the sheer complexity of the code in the products results in the need to be able to address security-related issues in released products. Lexmarkâs software and hardware products contain hundreds of files, thousands of objects, and tens of millions of lines of code and a product that was released with no known vulnerabilities may indeed have new vulnerabilities identified over time. This can be due to a previously unidentified vulnerability found in custom code written by Lexmark, in a common shared system library, or in a third-party library integrated into the Lexmark software or firmware. Lexmarkâs security staff and experts monitor multiple channels for the identification of new security vulnerabilities including: internal review, customer service, security-focused press, security-related academic research, and technical alerts from organizations like NIST-National Vulnerability Database and US-Computer Emergency Readiness Team (US-CERT). Additionally, Lexmark uses scanning tools during the implementation phase that scan source code for out-of-date or vulnerable shared libraries.

Registration

Sign up [here](https://www.lexmark.com/en_us/GlobalPreferenceCenter.html "here") for the latest security alerts.

Identification Process

When new vulnerabilities are identified which might affect Lexmarkâs products, they are addressed via the following process:

1. The vulnerability is analyzed to determine if it affects the product. (Vulnerabilities found in shared system or third-party code libraries may not apply, depending on the way the code is used in the system).

2. Lexmarkâs security staff determines if the exploit mechanism for the vulnerability is possible in Lexmarkâs implementation.

3. If yes, then the security bug is scored using industry standard Common Vulnerability Scoring Systems (CVSS). Note: The severity score published in a technical alert may score differently in specific implementations.

4. Internal processes are initiated to log, track, patch, and test the bug fix, and updated code is provided via a patch process.

5. If the CVSS score warrants, Lexmark will issue a security advisory for the products affected.

Additional details can be found in our Secure Software Development Lifecycle (SSDL) [Whitepaper](/content/dam/lexmark/documents/white-paper/y2024/NA-SSDL-Overview_082224.pdf "Whitepaper").

Submitting an issue

For product security vulnerabilities affecting Lexmark printers, send an e-mail to securityalerts@lexmark.com.

You may use Lexmark's PGP key to encrypt sensitive information (Click [here](/content/dam/lexmark/documents/filedownloads/y2023/Lexmark-PGP-Public-Key.pem "here") to download our PGP public key).   Please also include your PGP key so we may communicate with you on sensitive issues.

# Advisory Details

February 15th, 2022
## (Pwn2Own) Lexmark MC3224i setuid Local Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-329ZDI-CAN-15895

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-44735](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44735) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Lexmark |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | MC3224i |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of Lexmark MC3224i printers. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the permissions set on root-owned service files. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of root. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Lexmark has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
| DISCLOSURE TIMELINE | * 2021-12-30 - Vulnerability reported to vendor * 2022-02-15 - Coordinated public release of advisory |

## (Pwn2Own) Lexmark MC3224i Command Injection Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-330ZDI-CAN-15894

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-44735](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-44735) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 5.5, [AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Lexmark |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | MC3224i |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Lexmark MC3224i printers. Although authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of packet captures. When parsing the filter property, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the www-data user. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Lexmark has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
