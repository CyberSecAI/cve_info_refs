Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44735:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw within the embedded web server of various Lexmark devices.
*   Specifically, the issue arises during the processing of packet captures, where user-supplied input for the "filter" property is not properly validated before being used in a system call.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands into the system via the web server. This is caused by improper handling of the filter property when parsing packet captures, and a system call is made without validating user input.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** While the advisory initially mentions that authentication is required, it also notes that the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed, therefore, an attacker can exploit the command injection vulnerability without authentication.
*   **setuid Permissions:** In one instance the vulnerability is described as being due to the permissions set on root-owned service files, allowing a local attacker to escalate their privileges by leveraging these incorrectly set permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device, granting them a significant level of control. This code execution can occur in the context of the `www-data` user or in the context of root depending on the specific vulnerability.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** In the case of the local privilege escalation vulnerability, an attacker can escalate privileges to root, gaining complete control over the device.
*   **Compromised Device:**  A compromised device can be used for further malicious activities, such as data exfiltration, denial of service, or as a foothold for attacks on the broader network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Adjacent Attack:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability from a network-adjacent position, requiring access to the same network segment as the vulnerable printer.
*   **Local Attack:** A local attacker, who has already obtained low-privileged code execution capabilities on the target system, can also exploit the vulnerability to elevate privileges to root.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** For the remote command injection, the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the targeted Lexmark printer.
*   **Low-Privileged Code Execution:** For the local privilege escalation, the attacker needs to first obtain the ability to execute code with low privileges on the target system.
*   **Ability to Bypass Authentication:**  The attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism to trigger the command injection.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to be able to access the vulnerable endpoint on the printer's webserver in order to execute the command injection.

**Additional Notes:**
*   There are multiple variants of this vulnerability that have been identified that all have the same CVE ID, but different attack vectors and contexts.
*   The vulnerability affects a range of Lexmark printer models.
*   Lexmark has released firmware updates to address the vulnerability.
*   The advisory recommends that users update to the fixed releases, if their device has one of the affected firmware versions.

In summary, CVE-2021-44735 describes a command injection vulnerability in Lexmark printers, allowing for remote or local arbitrary code execution due to insufficient input validation and improper file permissions, which can result in complete compromise of the affected device.
