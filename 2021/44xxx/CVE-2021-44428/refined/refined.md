{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's TFTP server implementation does not properly handle a long filename in a read request, leading to a buffer overflow.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of Service (DoS). The overflow crashes the TFTP server.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a crafted TFTP read request to the vulnerable server via UDP.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to send UDP packets to the target machine on port 69, typically from a remote machine on the same network or accessible via routing."
