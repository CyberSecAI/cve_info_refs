DIR-882 & DIR-882-US :: H/W Rev. Ax :: F/W v1.30B06\_Hotfix\_02 :: CVE-2021-44880, CVE-2021-44881, & CVE-2021-45998 :: Multiple Vulnerabilities

**Overview**

On January 6, 2021, a 3rd party security researcher reported the D-Link DIR-882 hardware revision Ax with firmware version v1.30B06\_Hotfix\_02 with a number of potential vulnerabilities.

As soon as D-Link was made aware of the reported security issues, we had promptly started our investigation and began developing security patches. The 3rd party publically disclosed the issue prior to the patches being available on our standard 90 day security patch release schedule. We do not recommend security researches act in this manner as they expose end-users to further risks without patches being available from the manufacture.

D-Link takes the issues of network security and user privacy very seriously. We have a dedicated task force and product management team on call to address evolving security issues and implement appropriate security measures.

**Report information**

         - CVE-2021-44880 :: LAN-Side - command injection vulnerability in the system function via a crafted HNAP1 POST request
