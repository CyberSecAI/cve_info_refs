Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44466:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Improper access controls in the Bitmask Riseup VPN installer when a non-default installation directory (outside of the system root) is used.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   The installer fails to set appropriate Access Control Lists (ACLs) on the installation directory when a custom install path is selected.
*   This allows lower-privileged users to modify or replace the VPN executable file.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   Local Privilege Escalation: A low-privileged user can replace the original VPN executable with a malicious one. When a higher-privileged user (e.g., an administrator) launches the modified executable, the attacker can gain administrator privileges.

**Attack vectors:**

*   Local attack: The attacker must have local access to the system with low-privilege credentials.
*   The attacker needs to replace the legitimate VPN executable with a malicious one.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   Local user account with low privileges on the target system.
*   Ability to write to the installation directory of Bitmask Riseup VPN when installed in a non-default location.
*   Requires a higher-privileged user to execute the replaced malicious executable.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Bitmask Riseup VPN version 0.21.6 and earlier.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 0.21.11 and later.
*   The advisory timeline shows that Tenable disclosed the vulnerability to the vendor on October 18, 2021, and the vendor provided a fix on December 17, 2021.
