Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a combination of two critical issues:

1.  **Broken Access Control:** The application lacks proper session management and access control checks. This allows unauthenticated users to directly access and execute PHP files (specifically `/Side.php`) without any authorization.
2.  **SQL Injection:** User-supplied input, specifically the `syear` parameter, is directly incorporated into an SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The application does not verify user sessions, allowing any user to trigger the vulnerable code path.
*   **SQL Injection:** The `syear` parameter is directly inserted into an SQL query, making the application vulnerable to SQL injection attacks.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** User-provided data is not properly validated or sanitized, which allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Direct Exposure of Conditional Statements:** Conditional statements directly use user-supplied inputs, which allows an attacker to control the execution flow by supplying specific parameter values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Full Database Control:** A successful SQL injection attack grants an attacker the ability to execute arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to data exfiltration, data modification, and data deletion.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Due to the severity of the SQL injection, an attacker can potentially take complete control of the database server and the entire application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated:** The attack can be performed remotely by any user without prior authentication.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack is performed through crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/Side.php` endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable application.
*   **HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of HTTP requests and how to craft them to include malicious SQL payloads in the `syear` parameter.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable code is found within the `/Side.php`, `/Warehouse.php`, `/functions/Current.php`, and `/functions/GetMP.php` files of the RosarioSIS application.
*   The SQL injection vulnerability is exploitable in multiple ways:
    *   **Time-based blind SQL injection:** Can be triggered by injecting time-delaying functions in the `syear` parameter.
    *   **Error-based SQL injection:** The injected SQL query and related error messages are displayed directly on the page.
    *   **Boolean-based blind SQL injection:** Can be triggered by injecting conditional statements in the `syear` parameter.
*   The content provides a complete proof of concept (PoC) demonstrating the vulnerability using sqlmap.
