Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-44519:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal flaw in a specific function of the Citrix XenMobile Server REST API. This allows an attacker to manipulate file paths.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Directory Traversal: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, specifically within a file path parameter, enabling attackers to navigate outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: By exploiting the directory traversal, an attacker can upload arbitrary files to the server. This can lead to the execution of malicious code on the server, potentially giving the attacker complete control over the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
- Authenticated: The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network access to the vulnerable XenMobile Server
- Valid user credentials that allow interaction with the vulnerable REST API.

**Additional details:**
- The provided content indicates that this vulnerability was discovered by CHT Security (specifically TsungShu Chiu).
- The vulnerability is present in:
    - XenMobile Server Version 10.14.0 before rolling patch 4
    - XenMobile Server Version 10.13.0 before rolling patch 7
-  A GitHub gist also corroborates this information, stating: "Citrix XenMobile Server 10.12 RP9 and before, there is an Authenticated Directory Traversal vulnerability, leading to remote code execution"
