The provided content contains detailed information about CVE-2021-44255.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the insecure deserialization of a Python pickle file. Specifically, the MotionEye application allows an authenticated user to upload a backup file that includes a `tasks.pickle` file. This pickle file is then deserialized by the application, which can lead to arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
1. **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes the `tasks.pickle` file without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious code.
2. **Default Credentials:** The default username ("admin") and blank password for the admin account make it easy for attackers to gain access.
3. **Lack of Rate Limiting:** There is no rate limiting on login attempts, which allows brute-force attacks against the login page.
4. **Exposed configuration files:** The `/config/list` endpoint can expose configuration files with sensitive information like email passwords.
5. **Command injection via motion detection:** The application allows an admin to configure a system command to be run when motion is detected.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can achieve remote code execution (RCE) on the underlying system. This can lead to complete system compromise, data breaches, and botnet inclusion. The attacker gains the ability to run arbitrary code, potentially compromising other devices on the network as well.

**Attack vectors:**
1. **Malicious `tasks.pickle` file:** The attacker creates a malicious `tasks.pickle` file containing arbitrary code, then uploads it to the server via a crafted backup file through the web interface.
2. **Motion Detection Command Injection:** The attacker configures the motion detection to run arbitrary system commands via the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
1.  **Authentication:** The attacker needs to authenticate to the web interface of MotionEye using default credentials or previously obtained valid credentials.
2. **Network access:** The attacker must have network access to the MotionEye instance. This often includes publicly exposed instances.

**Additional Details:**
The content provides additional details, including:
*   Shodan search script to identify publicly exposed MotionEye instances.
*   Python scripts to test for public camera feeds.
*   Python script to automate the RCE exploit, including login, config download, pickle creation, backup modification, and restore.
*   Details of the `tasks.pickle` file structure within the backup archive.
*   Description of how to exploit the motion detection functionality.
*   A detailed analysis of exposed configuration files, including sensitive information.
