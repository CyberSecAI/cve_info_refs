## Vulnerability Information for CVE-2021-44568

**Root cause of vulnerability**:
The vulnerability stems from two heap-buffer-overflow issues within the `resolve_dependencies` function of the `libsolv` library. These overflows are caused by unsafe access to the `decisionmap` array due to insufficient bounds checking. Specifically:
    1. At `src/solver.c: line 1940`: An out-of-bounds read occurs due to the use of `-r->p` as an index into the `decisionmap` array, where `-r->p` can be a negative value beyond the array's bounds.
    2. At `src/solver.c: line 1995`: An out-of-bounds read occurs due to the use of `p` as an index into the `decisionmap` array, where the value of `p` depends on `pool->whatprovidesdata + r->d`, which can lead to a value of `p` beyond the allocated size of the `decisionmap`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
- Heap-based buffer overflows in the `resolve_dependencies` function.
- Lack of proper bounds checking when accessing the `decisionmap` array.
- Use of potentially negative index `-r->p` without validation.
- Use of an index `p` derived from `pool->whatprovidesdata + r->d`, which can become out of bounds.

**Impact of exploitation**:
- Denial of Service (DoS): The heap-buffer-overflow can cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.
- Potential for further exploitation: While the immediate impact is DoS, heap overflows can potentially be leveraged for more severe exploits, such as arbitrary code execution, though this is not explicitly demonstrated in the provided information.

**Attack vectors**:
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting specific input to the `resolve_dependencies` function, which can be achieved through crafted package dependency data.
- Attackers can provide a specially crafted PoC using tools like `testsolv` to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position**:
- Ability to provide input to `libsolv` that can control the values of `r->p`, `pool->whatprovidesdata`, and `r->d`.
- An attacker can trigger the vulnerabilities if they can control the package dependency data that `libsolv` processes.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information includes AddressSanitizer (ASAN) outputs, which clearly show the heap buffer overflows at the specified source code lines.
- The fix for this issue is referenced as commit `0077ef2`
- The issue was initially reported on December 13, 2020, and assigned CVE-2021-44568 on February 22, 2022.
