      "root_cause": "The JDBC Appender in Apache Log4j2 does not properly restrict JNDI data source names, allowing an attacker to use a JNDI URI to execute remote code when the logging configuration file can be modified.",

        "Insufficient validation of JNDI data source names in JDBC Appender",
        "Inadequate protection against attacker-controlled JNDI endpoints"
