- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A null pointer dereference occurs within the `gf_isom_parse_movie_boxes_internal()` function when parsing a crafted MP4 file. The code attempts to dereference a null pointer, leading to a segmentation fault and application crash.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Null pointer dereference. The function `gf_isom_parse_movie_boxes_internal()` attempts to access memory through a pointer that is null, leading to the crash. Specifically, the crash occurs when `mov eax, dword ptr [rsi]` is executed, where `rsi` is NULL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploitation will result in a segmentation fault, causing the application to crash. This can lead to denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a maliciously crafted MP4 file. In the provided example, the command ` ./MP4Box -lsr poc_1` demonstrates the exploit.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide the crafted MP4 file to the application (`MP4Box` in this case). No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.
