  "CVE-2021-44132": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is an OS command injection in C-DATA ONU4FERW devices. By exploiting a flaw in the 'formImportOMCIShell' function, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The web server (boa) directly passes user-provided input from the 'omcishell' file as a parameter to the `system` function, which leads to OS command injection.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "OS Command Injection",
         "Improper input validation"
      ],
      "impact": "Remote code execution on the device. An attacker can gain a reverse shell and execute arbitrary commands, potentially leading to full device compromise.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "HTTP POST request to the '/boaform/formImportOMCIShell' endpoint."
      ],
       "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the device's web interface, and needs to have access to the debugging user 'e8c' or 'adminisp'. "
