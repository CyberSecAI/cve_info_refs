- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The affected devices do not correctly process certain specially crafted packets sent to port 102/tcp.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper validation of the syntactic correctness of input (CWE-1286).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) in the device.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted packets to port 102/tcp.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges to send the malicious packets.
