{
  "CVE-2021-44981": {
    "root_cause": "The config.php file has a variable which takes a GET parameter value and parses it into a `shell_exec('');` function without proper sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
      "Remote Code Execution",
      "Privilege Escalation"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution, potentially leading to full system compromise due to the media server running as root, which allows for privilege escalation using the `sudo` command within the `shell_exec` function.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET request",
      "Network"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to send a crafted HTTP GET request with a malicious payload within a specific parameter. Low privileges are required."
