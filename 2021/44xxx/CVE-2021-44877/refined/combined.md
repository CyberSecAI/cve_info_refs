Title: Broken Access Control on Systeam ERP
CVE: CVE-2021-44877
Description:
The Systeam application is an ERP system that uses a mixed architecture based on SaaS tenant and user management, and on-premise database and web application counterparts.
A broken access control vulnerability has been found while using a temporary generated token in order to consume api resources.
The vulnerability allows an unauthenticated attacker to use an api endpoint to generate a temporary JWT token that is designed to reference the correct tenant prior to authentication, to request system configuration parameters using direct api requests.
The correct exploitation of this vulnerability causes sensitive information exposure. In case the tenant has an smtp credential set, the full credential information is disclosed.
Affected version:
VersÃ£o 2.22.8 build 1724
Fix:
An updated version has been issued.
OWASP TOP 10:
A01:2021 â Broken Access Control
