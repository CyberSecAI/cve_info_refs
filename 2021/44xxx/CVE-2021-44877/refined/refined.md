- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application uses a temporary JWT token, intended to reference the correct tenant before authentication, improperly allowing an unauthenticated user to access API resources.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control. An unauthenticated attacker can generate a temporary JWT token to access system configuration parameters using a specific API endpoint.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive information exposure. If the tenant has SMTP credentials set, the full credential information is disclosed.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based, exploiting an API endpoint to generate temporary JWT tokens.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be unauthenticated and able to access the vulnerable API endpoint.
