Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   **Broken Access Controls:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control enforcement within the DeltaRM 1.2 application. The application allows unprivileged users to perform actions that should be restricted to privileged accounts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR):** Unprivileged users can manipulate parameters like `tableUid` and `datas[query]` to directly access and modify resources (risk labels) they should not have permission to.
*   **Missing Authorization Checks:** The application fails to properly validate the user's role and permissions before executing actions on risk labels.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not properly validate the input data in the request body, allowing unprivileged users to create, edit, and delete labels by injecting malicious payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Modification of Risk Labels:** Attackers can create, edit, and delete risk labels like Criticality and Priority Indication, potentially disrupting the system and manipulating risk assessments.
*   **Data Manipulation:** By manipulating these labels, attackers could impact the accuracy and integrity of risk data within the application.
*   **Potential for System Instability:** Deleting essential labels could destabilize the application's risk management functionality.
*   **Unauthorized Export of Data:** Unprivileged users can export Criticality labels, potentially leading to data leaks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by crafting specific POST requests to the `/core/table/query` and `/risque/administration/parametrage/ajax-create-criticite-type` endpoints.
*   **Manipulated parameters:** Attackers manipulate parameters like `tableUid`, `datas[query]`, and form data to perform unauthorized actions.
*   **Exploitation of missing authorization:** The attacker does not need elevated privileges, only an authenticated user session, to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account within the DeltaRM 1.2 application, even with unprivileged access.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the affected server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content includes proof-of-concept requests demonstrating how to exploit the vulnerability to delete, create, and export risk labels.
*   The vulnerability has been fixed in a later version of DeltaRM, with a patch released on 11-12-2021.
*   The vendor was notified on 26-10-2021, acknowledged the report on 28-10-2021, and released a fix on 11-12-2021.
*   The gist includes recommendations for preventing similar vulnerabilities, including implementing default deny policies, logging access control failures, rate limiting API access, and using JWT tokens.
