- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JTTK library is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write when parsing specially crafted JT files. Specifically, the write occurs past the end of an allocated structure.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a maliciously crafted JT file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious JT file with an affected product. The attacker does not need any special privileges or network access to exploit the vulnerability. The attack vector is local and requires user interaction (UI:R).
