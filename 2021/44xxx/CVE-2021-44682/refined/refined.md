Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44682:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `EVStorageQueueBroker.exe` component of Veritas Enterprise Vault. This lack of validation leads to the deserialization of untrusted data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core weakness is the application's failure to sanitize or validate data before deserializing it. This allows an attacker to inject malicious serialized objects that, when deserialized, execute arbitrary code.
- **.NET Remoting Vulnerabilities:** The Enterprise Vault application uses .NET Remoting TCP ports for communication which are vulnerable and can be exploited.
- **Lack of Authentication:** Authentication is not required to exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected Enterprise Vault server.
- **Context of Execution:** The code is executed within the context of the Enterprise Vault Storage Service.
- **Complete Compromise:** The vulnerability could potentially allow a complete compromise of the affected system due to the ability to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The vulnerability is exposed through network services, which allows remote exploitation.
- **.NET Remoting Ports:** Attackers can target the .NET Remoting TCP ports used by Enterprise Vault.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable Enterprise Vault server.
- **RDP access (Conditional):** While the primary attack vector is over the network, having RDP access on the network, knowing the IP address of the EV server, EV process IDs, EV TCP dynamic ports, and EV remoteable object URIs can also be used to exploit the vulnerability if the firewall is not properly configured.
- **Knowledge of Target:** The attacker needs knowledge of the specific ports, process IDs and object URIs to interact with the vulnerable services.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in `EVStorageQueueBroker.exe`.
- The vulnerability is classified as critical with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- All currently supported versions of Enterprise Vault are affected
- Veritas has issued an update to correct this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported through Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative (ZDI).
