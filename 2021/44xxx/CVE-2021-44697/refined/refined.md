Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing MOV files in Adobe Audition. This leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125): The software reads data beyond the allocated buffer while parsing MOV files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Disclosure: An attacker can potentially read sensitive information from the application's memory.
- Privilege Escalation: The advisory mentions the possibility of privilege escalation. However, this seems to be a general statement about the impact of out of bounds reads in the advisory rather than a specific vulnerability present in this particular instance.
- Arbitrary Code Execution:  It is stated that an attacker could leverage this vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious MOV File: An attacker can craft a malicious MOV file designed to trigger the out-of-bounds read when opened in Adobe Audition.
- Malicious Web Page:  The attacker can also host a malicious web page that causes a victim to load the crafted MOV file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- User Interaction: The attack requires user interaction, meaning the user must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.
- No special privileges are required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Mat Powell of Trend Micro Zero Day Initiative.
- Adobe has released updates to address this vulnerability.
- The advisory also includes two other out-of-bounds read vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-44698 and CVE-2021-44699) that share the same impact, attack vector and root cause.
