- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds read
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The software is vulnerable to out-of-bounds read (CWE-125). This vulnerability allows an attacker to read memory outside of the intended buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to privilege escalation, potentially allowing an attacker to gain elevated privileges within the system.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the system and needs user interaction (UI:R) to trigger the vulnerability. The user must be tricked into opening a specially crafted file. No privileges are needed to trigger this vulnerability (PR:N).
