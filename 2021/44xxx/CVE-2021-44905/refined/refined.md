The provided content describes a vulnerability in the Fortessa FTBTLD Smart Lock.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the BLE (Bluetooth Low Energy) service that allows reading and writing to the device name without requiring authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unauthenticated Configuration Modification:** The device's BLE service allows unauthenticated users to write to characteristics, specifically the lock's name. This is due to the characteristic being set to READ WRITE.
*   **Denial of Service:** Modifying the device name causes the official app to fail to connect to the lock until power is cycled by removing the batteries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can prevent the authorized user from controlling the lock via the app. This is because the app will refuse to connect after the device name has been modified, requiring physical access to reset the lock.
*   **Physical Access Requirement**: If the user is locked out, they cannot use the app to gain entry until the lock is physically reset.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE):** Attackers use BLE to connect to the device and modify its name via the vulnerable service.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Proximity:** The attacker must be within Bluetooth range of the smart lock to perform the attack.
*   **Basic Tools:** The attacker needs tools to interact with BLE devices. This could include a mobile app (e.g., nRF Connect) or specialized software like HomePwn.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require prior knowledge of device credentials or any authentication to carry out the attack.
