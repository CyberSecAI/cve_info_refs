| there is a remote command execution vulnerability at the upload avatar function on the background.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24983597/141939276-609ba696-f974-470f-8c2e-2e1cf67e98c6.png)  upload pictures, then intercept data package, like this  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24983597/141939544-fd00c64c-76dc-4003-b81f-5c07038a1628.png)  then modify the file name to `jsp`, you can bypass the limit that cannot be uploaded by JSP files.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24983597/141939799-531e3f1d-cd91-4e74-9908-fc87bfe5b76d.png)  although JSP files have been uploaded, because of the existence of global interceptors, we cannot execute commands.  it would return 500  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24983597/141940263-627894b2-c89f-4ccf-9735-262d6ecbe303.png)  however, through my research, I found that the upload directory can be traversed.  just modify the parameter `dir`, like this  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/24983597/141940558-b033151a-9d6b-4371-8833-277efaed8a51.png)  then the file will be saved to the corresponding directory.
