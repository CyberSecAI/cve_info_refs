The provided content is related to CVE-2021-44584.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper sanitization of the `$_GET['s']` parameter in the `admin/globals.php` file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The code was using `addslashes()` to sanitize the input which is insufficient to prevent XSS attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts that would be executed in the victim's browser. This could lead to cookie theft, session hijacking, and other malicious actions.
**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `$_GET['s']` parameter. An attacker can craft a malicious URL with a payload in this parameter.
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft URLs with arbitrary content in the `s` parameter.

**More details:**
The provided content shows the fix for the vulnerability. The commit `3f89610f721120ded3ff491cb9cd99d9927c7582` replaces the original line:
```php
$admin_path_code = isset($_GET['s']) ? addslashes($_GET['s']) : '';
```
with
```php
$admin_path_code = isset($_GET['s']) ? addslashes(htmlClean($_GET['s'])) : '';
```
This change introduces the `htmlClean()` function to properly sanitize the input and prevent XSS attacks, in addition to the `addslashes()` function call. The commit message "fix:fix xss #113" also indicates that this change was specifically to address XSS vulnerability.
The second piece of content confirms that issue #113, which is linked to the commit, has been deleted.
