Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified SQL injection vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause:**
- The primary root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or filtering of user-supplied input parameters within the admin center pages of bloofoxCMS. This allows attackers to inject malicious SQL code into database queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Multiple SQL Injection Vulnerabilities:** The system is susceptible to various forms of SQL injection, including:
    - **Boolean-based blind SQL Injection:** Attackers can infer information by observing the application's behavior based on true/false conditions injected into SQL queries.
    - **Error-based SQL Injection:** Attackers can leverage database errors triggered by their injected SQL code to extract data.
    - **Time-based blind SQL Injection:** Attackers can exploit time delays caused by the injected code (e.g., using `SLEEP()`) to extract information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can gain unauthorized access to sensitive database information.
- Attackers could potentially modify or delete data within the database.
- Full compromise of the application and possibly the underlying server could occur.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerabilities are located within the admin center page of bloofoxCMS, specifically:
    - `/admin/index.php?mode=settings&page=projects&action=new`
    - `/admin/index.php?mode=settings`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable admin pages.
- Attacker requires knowledge or discovery of the vulnerable parameters within the POST requests.
-  The attacker needs access to the admin interface which might imply they already have some form of access or have bypassed authentication.

**Vulnerable Parameters Identified:**
- In `/admin/index.php?mode=settings&page=projects&action=new`:
  - `tmpl_id`
  - `mod_rewrite`
  - `urls`
  - Other parameters like `eta_doctype`, `lang_id`, `meta_charset`, `default_group`, `page`
- In `/admin/index.php?mode=settings`:
  - `u30`
  - Other parameters like `u1`, `u2`, `u6`, `u7`, `u4`, `u40`, `u8`, `u10`, `u12`, `u3`, `u5`, `u9`, `u20`, `sid`

**Additional Details:**
- The provided content includes examples of `sqlmap` payloads demonstrating the exploitability of these vulnerabilities.
- Specific injection techniques such as `RLIKE`, `FLOOR` based error injection, and `SLEEP()` are shown to be effective.
- The report explicitly states that "bloofoxCMS-0.5.2.1 have no security filtering of user input parameters in the admin center page."
-The attacker demonstrates the ability to extract database user information using `updatexml`.
