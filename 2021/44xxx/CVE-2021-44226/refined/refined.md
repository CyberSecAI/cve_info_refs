{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Razer Synapse service loads DLL files from a user-writable directory, `C:\\ProgramData\\Razer\\Synapse3\\Service\\bin`. While the installation process attempts to secure this directory, it can be circumvented by creating the directory beforehand, allowing an attacker to control its permissions and inject malicious DLLs. This also includes a time-of-check time-of-use race condition.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Privilege Management (CWE-269)",
      "Time-of-check Time-of-use Race Condition (CWE-367)",
	  "Unsafe installation path"
    ],
    "impact": "Local privilege escalation, allowing an unprivileged user to execute code with administrative privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": "Local access to the machine, exploitation of the Razer Synapse Service, DLL hijacking.",
    "required_capabilities": "Physical access to the target machine, ability to create directories and modify permissions, ability to trigger the Razer Synapse installation by plugging in a Razer device (or a device pretending to be one).",
	"description": "Razer Synapse is vulnerable to local privilege escalation via DLL hijacking. An attacker can create the service's DLL directory before installation, set permissions to prevent the system user from modifying it, and inject malicious DLLs. This exploits the Razer Synapse Service, which runs with elevated privileges, and also a time-of-check time-of-use race condition."
