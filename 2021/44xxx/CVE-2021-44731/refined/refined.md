{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A race condition in snapd's snap-confine binary, specifically in the `setup_private_mount()` function, allowed a local attacker to manipulate directory mounts.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Race condition in the creation and setup of temporary directories for snap sandboxes. The `setup_private_mount()` function used `mkdir` and `open`, followed by `fchmod` and `fchown`. An attacker could replace the directory after the open but before ownership change by another directory containing a symbolic link named `tmp`. This would cause the bind mount to follow the attacker controlled symlink. The patch introduced a `must_mkdir_and_open_with_perms()` function, which still had a vulnerability, specifically with the `rename()` call if the directory exists and doesn't belong to root.  If the group of the directory is not root, then `rename()` is called, allowing an attacker to rename a directory they don't own.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Local privilege escalation to root. By exploiting the race condition and a symlink, an attacker could control the mount point and then execute arbitrary code with root privileges by using a bind mount to gain access to a writable /tmp directory inside the snap sandbox, combined with an AppArmor bypass via multipathd.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local access, exploiting a race condition when setting up mount namespaces for snap applications.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Local user account with the ability to execute code. The attacker needs to be able to create and manipulate files and directories, and needs to exploit a race condition which requires precise timing to win it.  Additionally, multipathd vulnerabilities (CVE-2022-41974 and CVE-2022-41973) need to be exploited for AppArmor bypass."
