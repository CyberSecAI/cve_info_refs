Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44593:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content, specifically from `github.com_0fd7e6ab_20250115_083937.html`, `github.com_cd12c5c5_20250115_214648.html` and `www.nu11secur1ty.com_577bf165_20250115_214626.html`, directly references CVE-2021-44593 and describes a vulnerability in "Simple College Website". The description, vulnerable component, and steps to reproduce all align, therefore this content is considered relevant to the CVE.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is caused by an unauthenticated, union-based SQL injection flaw in the `username` parameter of the `/admin/login.php` page of Simple College Website v1.0.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the presence of a SQL injection vulnerability that allows arbitrary SQL queries to be executed. Specifically, this is a union-based SQL injection where the attacker can use `UNION SELECT` to inject data into the query results.
    *   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, as the vulnerable login page is accessible to anyone.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary File Upload:** Successful exploitation of the SQL injection allows the attacker to write data to the filesystem using `INTO OUTFILE`. This is then used to upload a PHP webshell.
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  By uploading a malicious PHP file, an attacker can gain remote code execution on the server, allowing arbitrary commands to be run.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through an HTTP POST request to `/admin/login.php`.
    *   The vulnerable `username` parameter is exploited by injecting malicious SQL code.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the web server.
    *   The attacker needs knowledge of the webserver's document root.
    *   The MySQL daemon needs to have write permissions to the webserver's document root.

*   **Technical Details:**
    *   The injected SQL payload is included within the POST parameter "username":
        ```sql
        ' union select null, null, ("<?php system($_GET['cmd']);?>"), null, null INTO OUTFILE '/var/www/html/testing.php'; -- -
        ```
    *   This payload injects a PHP webshell into the filesystem.
    *   The attacker can then trigger command execution by browsing to `/testing.php?cmd=<command>`. Example: `/testing.php?cmd=id`.

*   **Additional Information:**
    *   The vulnerability resides in the `login()` function within the `admin_class.php` file.
    *   The exploit requires knowledge of the web server root directory and potentially the document root, if they are different.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The content from `www.nu11secur1ty.com_8642bc23_20250115_214624.html` references the same vulnerability and provides a link to the exploit description. The blog post provides the same information in a summarised format, and is also relevant to this CVE.

*   The content from `github.com_cd12c5c5_20250115_214648.html` provides the vulnerable parameter list as `contact`, `email`, and `id`. This is further clarified by the payloads shown in the same file, which use time-based blind SQLi and `load_file()` in the same parameters. The github repo itself links to the PoC described in the nu11secur1ty blog.

*   The `www.sourcecodester.com` content is also relevant since it provides context about the vulnerable application and the developer who appears to have created it.

The rest of the provided content is unrelated to this CVE.
