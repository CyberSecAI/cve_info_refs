Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to the reported Stored XSS vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is the lack of sanitization of user-provided Markdown text before it is stored and displayed. This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts within the markdown content.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The application stores unsanitized user input (Markdown text) which is later rendered in a web page. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary Javascript in the victim's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    - Stealing cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Defacing the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through user-provided markdown text. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code disguised as markdown text. This is then stored in the system and is executed when another user views the malicious markdown content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to input/store markdown text into the system. The exact location where the vulnerable markdown input occurs is not clear from the given content.

**Additional details:**
- The provided commit message `Fix [#259](/francoisjacquet/rosariosis/-/issues/259 "Stored XSS Vulnerability") Prevent XSS: Sanitize the newly created MarkDown text` indicates that the vulnerability was addressed by sanitizing markdown text.
- The issue report also contains the following details:
    - RosarioSIS version: latest one at the time (commit `6549919d`)
    - PHP version: 7.2.13
    - PostgreSQL version: 10.6
    - Server: Apache 2.4.29 (Ubuntu)
    - Browser: Mozilla Firefox 64.0 (Ubuntu)

This information provides more context and confirms the existence of a stored XSS vulnerability due to unsanitized markdown input, which was subsequently addressed in a later commit.
