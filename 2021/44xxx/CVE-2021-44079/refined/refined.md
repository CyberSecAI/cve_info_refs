Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44079:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw in the Wazuh active response script `wazuh-slack`. The script constructs a `curl` command by embedding alert JSON data, which includes raw log lines, into the shell command line as the POST body. The issue is that single quotes within the JSON data are not escaped, allowing an attacker to truncate the command and inject arbitrary shell code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is that attacker-controlled data (raw log lines) within the JSON payload is inserted into a shell command without proper sanitization. Specifically, the lack of escaping single quotes allows for premature termination of the `-d` argument, enabling injection of arbitrary shell commands.
*   **Use of `system()`:** The use of the `system()` function in the active response scripts executes commands through a shell, which is vulnerable to command injection if user input is not carefully sanitized.

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to arbitrary code execution on the Wazuh manager/agent server. An attacker can leverage this to gain complete control over the affected system, leading to data breaches, system compromise, denial of service, and other severe impacts.

**Attack vectors:**

*   An attacker can trigger a Wazuh alert where the log line contains a single quote.
*   The active response script, specifically `wazuh-slack`, constructs a `curl` command with the unescaped log data as part of the JSON payload.
*   The unescaped single quote in the log data terminates the intended string, allowing the attacker to inject arbitrary shell commands.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to generate or influence log data that would trigger a Wazuh alert.
*   The attacker does not require prior authentication. The vulnerability is triggered via a crafted log message.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the active response configuration to determine the URL that the script will send the malicious POST request to.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability affects Wazuh versions 4.2.0 to 4.2.4.
*   The fix involves two key strategies:
    1.  Replacing the vulnerable `system()` function calls in active response scripts with `wpopenv()`, which avoids using a shell for executing subprocesses.
    2.  Sanitizing the active response payload on the manager side by escaping special characters such as `!`, `$`, `'`, and `` ` `` with their hexadecimal notation (`\x21`, `\x24`, `\x27`, and `\x60`, respectively) to prevent command injection.
*   The affected active response tools include `disable-account` (UNIX), `firewalld-drop` (Linux), `netsh` (Windows), `route-null` (Windows), and `wazuh-slack` (UNIX).
*   The fix is implemented in pull request [#10809](https://github.com/wazuh/wazuh/pull/10809) and was merged into version 4.2 of Wazuh.

This analysis provides more detail than the placeholder CVE description, particularly around the specifics of the vulnerability (command injection via unescaped single quotes), the attack vector (malicious log data triggering an alert), and the fix implemented (using `wpopenv` and sanitizing the payload).
