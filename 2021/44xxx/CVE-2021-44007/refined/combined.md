SSA-595101: Multiple File Parsing Vulnerabilities in JT2Go and
Teamcenter Visualization before V13.2.0.5

SUMMARY

Siemens has released version V13.2.0.5 for JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization to ﬁx multiple vulnera-
bilities that could be triggered when the products read maliciously crafted ﬁles in different ﬁle formats
(PDF, JT, TIFF, CGM and TIF). If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with any of the affected products,
this could lead the application to crash or potentially lead to arbitrary code execution.

Siemens recommends to update to the latest versions and to limit opening of untrusted ﬁles from unknown
sources in the affected products.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources in JT2Go and Teamcenter Visualization

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
