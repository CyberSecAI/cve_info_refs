- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Tiff_Loader.dll` contains an off-by-one error in the heap while parsing specially crafted TIFF files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Off-by-one error (CWE-193) in heap memory.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could cause a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a specially crafted TIFF file with an affected version of JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious TIFF file. The attacker also needs to be in a position to provide the crafted file (e.g. through phishing or other social engineering vectors).
