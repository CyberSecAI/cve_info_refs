- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Tiff_Loader.dll` contains an out-of-bounds write vulnerability while parsing specially crafted TIFF files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a specially crafted TIFF file with the affected software (JT2Go or Teamcenter Visualization).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious TIFF file, and the user needs to be tricked into opening it with the vulnerable software.
