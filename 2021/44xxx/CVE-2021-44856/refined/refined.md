Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The `EditFilterMergedContent` hook in the `ContentModelChange` class of MediaWiki did not properly handle the return value from the AbuseFilter extension. Specifically, the hook was not checking for a `false` return, which is intended to signal that an edit action should be interrupted.
*   The AbuseFilter's handling function in `ContentModelChange` doesn't have a return value and thus doesn't interrupt the action when it should.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inconsistent Hook Handling:** The `ContentModelChange` class handles the `EditFilterMergedContent` hook differently compared to the `EditFilterMergedContentHookConstraint` class. The former doesn't respect the `false` return value meant to interrupt the edit, while the later does.
*   **Bypass of AbuseFilter:** Due to the mishandling of the hook's return value, a title blocked by the AbuseFilter could still be created when using `Special:ChangeContentModel`, effectively bypassing the intended restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could create titles that should be blocked by the AbuseFilter.
*   This could lead to the creation of undesirable content or actions that the AbuseFilter was designed to prevent.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is exploited through the `Special:ChangeContentModel` page in MediaWiki.
*   An attacker would attempt to use `Special:ChangeContentModel` to create a page with a title that is blocked by the AbuseFilter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to access the `Special:ChangeContentModel` page.
*   The attacker needs knowledge of the titles or patterns blocked by the AbuseFilter.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The fix involves modifying the `ContentModelChange` class to properly check the return value of the `EditFilterMergedContent` hook, making it consistent with the `EditFilterMergedContentHookConstraint` class.
*   The fix has been backported to several MediaWiki branches.
*   The vulnerability is rated as low severity.
