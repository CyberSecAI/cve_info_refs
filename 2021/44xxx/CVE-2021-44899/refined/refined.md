The provided content relates to CVE-2021-44899.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Multiple vulnerable driver components within MSI Center allow for privilege escalation through specific IOCTL requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Direct interaction with physical memory via the `MmMapIoSpace` function call, mapping physical memory into a virtual address user-space.
- Read/write Model-Specific Registers (MSRs) via the `__readmsr/__writemsr` functions calls.
- Read/write 1/2/4 bytes to or from an IO port.

The vulnerable driver components are:
- `atidgllk.sys`
- `atillk64.sys`
- `MODAPI.sys/WinRing0x64.sys`
- `NTIOLib.sys` (multiple instances with different SHA-1 hashes)
- `NTIOLib_X64.sys` (multiple instances with different SHA-1 hashes)
- `WinRing0.sys`

**Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can achieve local privilege escalation from low-privileged users to `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`.

**Attack vectors:** Sending specific IOCTL requests to the vulnerable drivers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** Local access to a system with the vulnerable MSI Center version installed, and the ability to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable drivers.
