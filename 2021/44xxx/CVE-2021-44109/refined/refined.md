Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-44109:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** The `parse_multipart` function in `lib/sbi/message.c` has a fixed-size buffer (`multipart_parser_data_s`) with a maximum of 8 parts (`OGS_SBI_MAX_NUM_OF_PART`). When parsing a multipart message with more than 8 parts, the function overflows this buffer, leading to memory corruption on the stack.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The `amf_namf_comm_handle_n1_n2_message_transfer` function in `src/amf/namf-handler.c` can receive a request without `n2_info_container`. In such cases, the `n2InfoContent` variable is not set, but later, the code attempts to dereference `n2InfoContent->ngap_ie_type`, causing a null pointer dereference and a crash.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The fixed-size buffer in `parse_multipart` is a classic buffer overflow vulnerability. Inputting more parts than the buffer can handle leads to out-of-bounds write, which could overwrite other data in memory.
*   **Null Pointer Dereference:** The missing check for a null `n2InfoContent` before accessing its members allows an attacker to trigger a null pointer dereference, resulting in a crash and potentially other undefined behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Memory Corruption:** Overwriting data on the stack can lead to unpredictable program behavior, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The null pointer dereference leads to a crash of the AMF daemon (amfd), causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Multipart Message Overflow:** An attacker can send an HTTP2 request with `Content-Type: multipart/related` that contains more than 8 parts. This triggers the buffer overflow in `parse_multipart`.
*   **Missing n2_info_container:** An attacker can send a `n1-n2-messages` request without the `n2_info_container` field. This triggers the null pointer dereference in `amf_namf_comm_handle_n1_n2_message_transfer`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP2 requests to the vulnerable service. In the provided examples, this means targeting the AMF daemon (amfd) which listens on `127.0.0.5:7777`.
* For the null pointer dereference, a live UE context is required (i.e. a UE must be registered to trigger the vulnerability).

**Additional details:**

* The provided content includes Proof of Concept (PoC) attack requests for both vulnerabilities.
*   The memory corruption vulnerability is located in `lib/sbi/message.c` in the function `parse_multipart`.
*   The null pointer dereference vulnerability is located in `src/amf/namf-handler.c` in the function `amf_namf_comm_handle_n1_n2_message_transfer`.
* A fix for these vulnerabilities was implemented in commit `d919b2744cd05abae043490f0a3dd1946c1ccb8c`, as indicated in the provided content.

The commit message confirms the two vulnerabilities:
```
1. memory corruption
 - Overflow num_of_part in SBI message
2. null pointer dereference
 - n2InfoContent->ngap_ie_type
```
The fix addresses both issues by adding checks to prevent the buffer overflow and null pointer dereference.
