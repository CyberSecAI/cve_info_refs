  "CVE-2021-44269": {
    "description": "A heap out-of-bounds read flaw was found in WavPacks' WavpackPackSamples() function of src/pack_utils.c and only affects the command-line program of WavPack (not libwavpack). This flaw allows an attacker to exploit this flaw for a website that uses the WavPack command-line program on user-provided files, causing a denial of service.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an out-of-bounds read in the `WavpackPackSamples` function within `src/pack_utils.c` of the Wavpack command-line tool.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Heap out-of-bounds read"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful exploit leads to a denial-of-service (DoS).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted WAV file to the WavPack command-line program."
       ],
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious WAV file as input to the vulnerable `wavpack` command-line tool. If a webserver uses the vulnerable tool to process user-uploaded files, this is exploitable remotely."
