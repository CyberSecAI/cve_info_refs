Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-44095

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw present in the login page of the ProjectWorlds Hospital Management System in PHP version 1.0.
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection through the `lemail` parameter on the login page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Breach:** An attacker can use SQL injection to bypass authentication and extract sensitive data from the database.
- **Data Tampering:** Attackers could modify or delete data in the database, leading to potential data loss or manipulation.
- **Financial Loss:**  Compromised data, such as user's personal, transaction details, and financial information, could be publicly disclosed or used for competitive gains, leading to financial loss for the organization.
- **Session Hijacking:** Session tokens can be obtained, allowing the attacker to impersonate legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed through a crafted HTTP POST request to the login page (`index.php`).
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `lemail`.
- **Payload Injection:** By injecting malicious SQL code into the `lemail` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web application.
- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** Knowledge of HTTP request structure is needed to send the malicious requests
- **SQL Injection Knowledge:** Requires knowledge of SQL syntax to construct malicious SQL payloads
- **Automated Tools:** The attacker can use tools like SQLmap to automate the process of exploiting the SQL injection and dumping the database.

**Technical Details:**

- The provided exploit code injects a `sleep(20)` command into the SQL query via the `lemail` parameter. If the database pauses for 20 seconds, it indicates that the application executes the injected SQL.
- The vulnerable code does not use parameterized queries or proper input validation, which is the root cause of the SQL injection vulnerability.
- The provided content also suggests that user input is not being sanitized.

**Vulnerable Parameter:**
- "lemail="
