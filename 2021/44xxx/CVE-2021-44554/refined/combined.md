| Dear Cybele Software,  My name is Daniel Morales, from the IT Security Team of ARHS Spikeseed.  I recently found a vulnerability in Thinfinity VirtualUI that allows a malicious actor to enumerate users registered in the OS (Windows) through /changePassword  **How it works** By accessing the vector, an attacker can determine if a username exists thanks to the message returned; it can be presented in different languages according to the configuration of VirtualUI. Common users are administrator, admin, guest and krgtbt  **Payload** The vulnerable vector is "<https://example.com/changePassword?username=USERNAME>" where "USERNAME" need to be brute-forced.  **Vulnerable versions** It has been tested in VirtualUI version 2.1.37.2, 2.1.42.2, 2.5.0.0, 2.5.36.1, 2.5.36.2 and 2.5.41.0. |

| Hi Daniel,  Thanks for pointing that out. The versions you have listed are quite old, and, fortunately, this vulnerability was fixed in v3.0.  Please, let me know if you find anything else ! |
