- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). The attack requires a low level of complexity (AC:L), no privileges are required (PR:N), and user interaction is required (UI:R).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to inject malicious script that is stored and executed in a victim's browser when they access a certain page. The attacker does not require any special privileges but needs to somehow inject the script and make sure a user visits the affected page.
