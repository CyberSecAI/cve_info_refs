Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `create_url` function within the `output_helper.php` file of Open-AudIT Community. This function was not properly sanitizing user-supplied input passed through the URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Sanitization:** The `create_url` function did not adequately sanitize URL parameters, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected through the URL.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** By injecting malicious JavaScript into the URL, an attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser session when they visit a crafted link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to various malicious actions such as:
    - Session hijacking/stealing cookies
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    - Modifying the content of the page
    - Performing actions on behalf of the logged-in user

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL containing the JavaScript payload and trick a logged-in user into clicking it.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would need to use some form of social engineering to get a logged in user to click the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft Malicious URLs:** The attacker needs the ability to create malicious URLs containing JavaScript payloads.
- **Social Engineering Skills:** The attacker needs to convince a logged-in Open-AudIT user to click the crafted URL.
- **No authentication bypass**: The attacker can not directly exploit this vulnerability without an authenticated user clicking the crafted link.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects all versions of Open-AudIT Community prior to the release of v4.3.0.
- A patch was released in Open-AudIT v4.3.0, which addressed this issue by sanitizing user input in the `create_url` function.
- Workarounds included manually replacing the affected file `output_helper.php` with a patched version.
