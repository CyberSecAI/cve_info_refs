* [Errata - 4.2.0, 3.5.0 and onwards util function vulnerability](/wiki/spaces/OA/pages/3163951810/Errata%2B-%2B4.2.0%2B3.5.0%2Band%2Bonwards%2Butil%2Bfunction%2Bvulnerability)

See [Errata - 4.2.0, 3.5.0 and onwards util function vulnerability](/wiki/spaces/OA/pages/3163951810/Errata%2B-%2B4.2.0%2B3.5.0%2Band%2Bonwards%2Butil%2Bfunction%2Bvulnerability) |
