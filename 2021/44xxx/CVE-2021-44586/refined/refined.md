Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the security issue reported:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a path traversal vulnerability in the `/images;/../backup/download` endpoint. The application doesn't properly sanitize the `fileName` parameter, allowing an attacker to use `..` sequences to navigate to parent directories and access arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal flaw, also known as directory traversal.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input, specifically the `fileName` parameter.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited without authentication, meaning anyone can download arbitrary files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Download:** An attacker can download any file on the server that the web application has access to. This can include sensitive configuration files (e.g., `/etc/passwd`), source code, database credentials, and other confidential information. This is further emphasized by the example provided by the reporter showing the download of the `/etc/passwd` file.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive information can be exposed, potentially leading to further attacks, like privilege escalation and unauthorized access.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is an HTTP GET request to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   **Manipulated URL Parameter:** The `fileName` parameter in the query string is manipulated to include path traversal sequences (e.g., `../../../../../../../../etc/passwd`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to craft HTTP requests and manipulate URL parameters.
*   **No Authentication Needed:** The attacker does not need valid credentials as the vulnerability is unauthenticated.

The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, as it includes:
    *   A specific vulnerable URL path (`/images;/../backup/download`).
    *   The vulnerable parameter (`fileName`).
    *   A working Proof of Concept (PoC) showing how to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   A specific example using `/etc/passwd`.
    *   The fact that the vulnerability is unauthenticated.

This level of detail allows for a clear understanding of the vulnerability and its impact.
