- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A null pointer dereference exists in the `gf_sg_vrml_mf_alloc()` function.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Null pointer dereference. The code attempts to dereference a null pointer, leading to a crash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability causes a segmentation fault and application crash.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when processing a crafted MP4 file. Specifically, the issue arises during scene parsing when using the `MP4Box -lsr` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted MP4 file to the `MP4Box` tool.
