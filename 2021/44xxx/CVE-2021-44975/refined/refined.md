Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44975:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a heap buffer overflow in the `objc_build_refs` function within the `radare2` reverse engineering framework, specifically when parsing Mach-O files. The function allocates a buffer based on a sanitized maximum size, but subsequently uses unsanitized values when reading data into the buffer which can lead to an overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Heap Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is the heap buffer overflow. The `objc_build_refs` function calculates `maxsize` by sanitizing input sizes `ss_selrefs` and `ss_const`, but the `r_io_read_at` function uses `ss_selrefs` and `ss_const` directly, resulting in potential overflows if these values exceed `maxsize`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service:** A successful exploit can lead to a crash of the `radare2` application due to memory corruption.
- **Potential Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, heap buffer overflows can, in some cases, be leveraged for arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Binary:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted Mach-O binary file.
- **Local File Analysis:**  An attacker needs to provide the crafted binary to radare2 for analysis.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to provide a crafted binary:** The attacker must be able to provide a malicious Mach-O file to the user of radare2.
- **Local execution of radare2:** The user must use radare2 to analyze the provided file.

**Technical Details:**

The `objc_build_refs` function calculates a maximum size (`maxsize`) for a buffer based on the sizes of the selrefs and const sections of a Mach-O file:
```c
size_t ss_selrefs = objc->_selrefs->vsize;
size_t ss_const = objc->_const->vsize;
size_t maxsize = R_MAX (ss_const, ss_selrefs);
maxsize = R_MIN (maxsize, objc->file_size);
ut8 *buf = calloc (1, maxsize);
```
However, when reading data into the buffer, it uses the original unsanitized sizes:
```c
if (!r_io_read_at (objc->core->io, va_selrefs, buf, ss_selrefs)) { ... }
...
if (!r_io_read_at (objc->core->io, objc->_const->vaddr, buf, ss_const)) { ... }
```
This discrepancy allows an attacker to craft a Mach-O file where `ss_selrefs` or `ss_const` is greater than the allocated `maxsize`, resulting in a heap buffer overflow when `r_io_read_at` is called.

**Mitigation:**

The issue was addressed in radare2 version 5.6.0 by using the `maxsize` variable in the `r_io_read_at` calls, ensuring that the read operation does not exceed the allocated buffer size.
```c
 if (!r_io_read_at (objc->core->io, va_selrefs, buf, maxsize)) { ... }
    ...
  if (!r_io_read_at (objc->core->io, objc->_const->vaddr, buf, maxsize)) { ... }
```

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by Angelos T. Kalaitzidis of CENSUS.
- The fix was included in version 5.6.0 of radare2, released in February 2022.
- The advisory also mentions that similar issue was found in the handling of the const section, which was fixed in the same commit.
- The vulnerability is triggered during the analysis phase of a Mach-O binary by using the `aao` command in radare2.

This detailed analysis should give a good understanding of the vulnerability and its impact.
