Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the Nacos application when handling the `pageNo` and `pageSize` parameters in the `/nacos/v1/auth/users` endpoint. Specifically, the application does not sanitize or encode user-supplied values before rendering them in the response, allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks, where user-provided input is directly included in the HTTP response without proper sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the page, which will execute within the context of the victim's browser when they access the crafted URL.
- **Session hijacking:** This can lead to session hijacking, allowing an attacker to steal user cookies and potentially gain unauthorized access to the application.
- **Data theft:** Attackers can use the JavaScript to steal user data and sensitive information.
- **Defacement:** Attackers could modify the appearance of the web page.
- **Phishing:** Attackers might inject a phishing login prompt to capture user credentials.

**Attack vectors:**
- **HTTP GET request with malicious query parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered when an attacker crafts a URL with malicious JavaScript code injected into the `pageNo` or `pageSize` parameters of the `/nacos/v1/auth/users` endpoint.
- **User interaction:** An attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on or visiting the malicious URL to execute the XSS payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to craft URLs:** The attacker needs to be able to create URLs with malicious JavaScript within the query parameters.
- **Social engineering:** The attacker needs to convince or trick a victim into accessing the specially crafted malicious URL.

**Additional Details:**
- The reported vulnerability is present in Nacos version 2.0.3
- The vulnerability does not require any authentication.
- The provided content includes two example payloads:
  - `/nacos/v1/auth/users?pageNo=1&pageSize=<script>alert(1)</script>`
  - `/nacos/v1/auth/users?pageNo=<script>alert(1)</script>&pageSize=1`
- The reported issue has been labeled as a duplicate, which suggests that this vulnerability has been reported before.
