Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in the `profile_action.php` script of the User-Registration-and-Login-System-With-Admin-Panel, specifically when handling the `fullname` parameter during a user update action.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is susceptible to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. The `fullname` parameter in the `update_user` action is directly concatenated into the SQL query, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker can leverage SQL injection to dump the entire database, potentially exposing sensitive user information, transaction details, financial information, and session tokens.
*   **Data Tampering:** The attacker may modify or delete data in the database, leading to permanent alterations of the application's content or behavior.
*   **Unauthorized Access:**  By extracting user credentials, an attacker may gain unauthorized access to the application and user accounts.
*   **Financial Loss:**  Compromised data can be publicly disclosed, or used for competitive gain, resulting in financial loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP POST request to `profile_action.php`, targeting the `update_user` action.
*  **Vulnerable Parameter:** The `fullname` parameter within the POST request is the entry point for the SQL injection attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the application to send HTTP requests.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:**  The attacker needs basic knowledge of web requests, HTTP methods, and how to craft URL-encoded parameters to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **SQL Knowledge:** Knowledge of SQL is required to craft malicious SQL injection payloads.  Tools like SQLMAP can automate the exploitation.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerable parameter is `fullname`.
*   The vulnerable page is `profile_action.php` with `action=update_user` parameter
*   The vulnerable request is POST request.
*   The provided exploit uses `fullname=test2'%2b(select*from(select(sleep(20)))a)%2b'`  to confirm the injection exists by causing a time delay, demonstrating a successful SQL injection.
*   The attacker can use SQLMap to fully exploit the vulnerability to dump the database.
