## The Pentest Approach

### True cybersecurity assurance doesn’t come from a one size fits all solution.

### It comes from a robust approach that’s been developed over 20 years delivering cybersecurity testing.

#### 1. Understanding your test requirements

No two organisations, or projects, are the same. We work closely with you to gain an in-depth knowledge of your needs and a detailed understanding of the environment under investigation, before putting forward a bespoke proposal of work.

#### 2. Expert led, manual testing

Our test services are conducted manually by our expert cybersecurity consultants & are designed to challenge your current cybersecurity measures. All our consultants are directly employed by us, meaning we ensure the highest quality of work.

#### 3. Reporting, tailored to your needs

Reporting isn’t just a piece of paper, it’s an ongoing process. Our reporting process can be tailored to suit your needs, providing you with timely, relevant, and detailed information, not just on our findings but also our expert remediation advice.

#### 4. Post-test support & documentation

Our job doesn't finish on the delivery of a test report. We make our cybersecurity consultants available after the test to provide remediation support and can provide fix checks, as well as additional documentation where necessary.

My post is really to remind myself that this exists. The hard work was done on labofapenetrationtester.com back in 2015. I found that this worked for me well.

I moved house a while back and the place came with one of those Air BnB style key boxes on the front made by Master Lock. There was nothing in the handover about it and it was likely that it had belonged to the previous previous owners as it looked unloved for a long time.…

In this post I present a short piece of PowerShell that helped me find missing patches in a .net application. The target was a thick client where source code was not provided. Almost everything has outdated dependencies and the goal for me is to see if any of them will provide an obvious way to…

# Leveraging XSS to get RCE in Textpattern 4.8.7

## Researchers:

## Paul Ritchie

As part of our ongoing commitment to Open-Source security, Pentest Ltd conducted a research project into Textpattern version 4.8.7.

Textpattern is a free and open-source content management system for PHP and MySQL. According to builtwith.com it was publicly in use on over two-thousand websites.

In this instance an unauthenticated attacker could craft an attack resulting in Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend server. To achieve this the victim must click on a maliciously generated link which embedded HTML tags and JavaScript commands. If the victim had sufficient privileges and an established authentication session, then the application would be exploited after that single click.

## **Finding the Vulnerability**

The post preview function was vulnerable to XSS through the “Body” parameter. This exploit can be used to steal the CSRF token to enable arbitrary code execution through the plugin upload functionality.

The following shows the HTTP request used to confirm the preview was vulnerable:

```

GET
/textpattern/index.php?Body=A+test+article.+%0D%0A%0D%0A%3Cimg+src%3Dx+onerror%3Dalert(1)%3E&app_mode=async&view=preview HTTP/1.1
Host: 192.168.127.128
Cookie: [...] Valid Cookie is Added By the Victim’s Browser [...]
Connection: close

```

By default, the application submitted the preview request over HTTP POST. No distinction was made between data in the POST body or within a GET URL making it possible to exploit this via a link.

When decoded, the HTML payload was as shown below:

```

![](x)

```

This included a new “img” tag which executed a popup message when viewed in a browser:

![Leveraging XSS to get RCE in Textpattern 4.8.7 - popup message](data:image/png;base64...)

An unauthenticated attacker with knowledge of this issue could create a URL for any installation of textpattern. The attacker did not require authenticated access to the target installation of textpattern. The victim must interact with the payload at a time when they are authenticated.

If the victim has access to the “plugins” functionality the attacker could gain Remote Code Execution (RCE) by uploading a PHP file to the server. The plugin upload functionality required a valid “\_txp\_token” which acted as a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) defence. The CSRF token was static for the duration of a user’s session. It was accessible easily in the DOM in locations such as the following:

```

```

To exploit this the attacker would need to use JavaScript to request the “/textpattern/index.php” URL and extract the “\_txp\_token” from the location highlighted above. The following JavaScript was used to steal the token, and then to upload a PHP webshell:

```

```

The above payload could be delivered using a link with the techniques demonstrated below:

```

/textpattern/index.php?Body=![](x)'))>&app_mode=async&view=preview

```

The “eval” function executed the payload which is Base64 decoded using “atob”. To exploit this the full JavaScript payload must be Base64 and then URL encoded, before being pasted over the “<PAYLOAD>” marker above.

After exploitation a new “csrfshell.php” script was accessible which executed OS commands supplied in the “cmd” parameter:

![Leveraging XSS to get RCE in Textpattern 4.8.7 - confirmed exploitation](data:image/png;base64...)

This confirmed that exploitation had occurred.

## **Risk Analysis**

 **Risk Category:** High
**CVSS:** 9.6/Critical – AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
 **Explanation:** In this instance an unauthenticated attacker could craft an attack resulting in Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the backend server. To achieve this the victim must click on a maliciously generated link which embedded HTML tags and JavaScript commands. If the victim had sufficient privileges and an established authentication session, then they would be exploited after that single click.

## **Recommendation**

To protect your Textpattern installations update to 4.8.8 as soon as possible. Find out more [here](https://textpattern.com/weblog/textpattern-488-released-php-81-support-security-fix-and-more).

## **Affected Item(s)**

Textpattern version 4.8.7
