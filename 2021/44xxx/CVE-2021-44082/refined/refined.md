  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The post preview function was vulnerable to XSS through the “Body” parameter, which could be exploited via a GET request due to no distinction between POST and GET data. This XSS vulnerability is then leveraged to steal the CSRF token.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the post preview function.",
      "Lack of distinction between POST and GET request data handling.",
      "Insufficient CSRF protection (static token easily accessible in the DOM)."
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution (RCE). An attacker can upload a malicious PHP webshell and execute arbitrary OS commands on the backend server.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafting a malicious link with embedded HTML tags and JavaScript commands.",
      "Exploiting the XSS vulnerability via a GET request to inject malicious JavaScript.",
      "Stealing the CSRF token through JavaScript and using it to upload a malicious PHP plugin."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious link and convince a logged-in user with sufficient privileges to click it. The attacker does not need prior authentication to the application. The user must be logged in with sufficient privileges for the exploit to be successful."
