- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JTTK library in affected products is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure while parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a specially crafted JT file. The attack vector is local, requiring user interaction to open the malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious JT file using affected software.
