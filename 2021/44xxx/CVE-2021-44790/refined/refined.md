```
Root cause of vulnerability:
A carefully crafted request body can cause a buffer overflow in the mod_lua multipart parser (r:parsebody() called from Lua scripts).

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Buffer Overflow

Impact of exploitation:
- Denial of service.
- Potential arbitrary code execution.

Attack vectors:
- Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious body to a server using mod_lua.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- Ability to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable server.
- No authentication required.
