Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44207:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Acclaim USAHERDS web application versions 7.4.0.1 and earlier, used static `ValidationKey` and `DecryptionKey` values.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials:** The application uses hardcoded encryption keys instead of generating unique ones.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker with knowledge of the static keys can craft malicious ViewState data which, when deserialized by the server, leads to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through crafted ViewState data.
- The attacker needs to know the hardcoded `ValidationKey` and `DecryptionKey` values to create a valid, malicious ViewState.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain the `ValidationKey` and `DecryptionKey` values through another vulnerability or channel. The vulnerability is not exploitable without access to these hardcoded keys.
-  An attacker with access to the hardcoded keys can then perform the exploitation from a remote location by sending malicious ViewState data to the server.

**Additional details:**
- The keys are used to secure the application's ViewState, which is used for managing the state of web page elements.
- The vulnerability has been patched in a release after November 2021.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Douglas Bienstock from Mandiant.
