Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-44245:

**Vulnerability:** SQL Injection (Second-Order)

**Root Cause:**
The `username` and `contactno` parameters in the "COVID 19 Testing Management System (CTMS) 1.0" are vulnerable to SQL injection. The application unsafely incorporates user-supplied input into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- SQL Injection:  The application is susceptible to SQL injection attacks due to lack of input validation and sanitization.
- Second-Order SQL Injection: The vulnerability is described as "second-order," suggesting that the injected SQL might not execute immediately, but rather be stored and triggered later during a subsequent query. This means the injected payload is stored, and then later retrieved and executed when the application fetches the stored data for use in a database query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Remote Code Injection: A successful attack can lead to Remote Code Injection. This would allow an attacker to execute arbitrary SQL queries which could potentially grant the attacker the ability to:
  - Bypass authentication
  - Override admin password
  - Access or modify sensitive data in the database
- Complete compromise of the application and the database.
- Privilege escalation to admin by changing the admin password.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP requests to the application using the vulnerable `username` and `contactno` parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. They don't need prior access. This implies the attack can be performed remotely via broadcast networks.
- The attacker must be able to craft SQL injection payloads.

**Technical Details:**
- Vulnerable parameters: `username`, `contactno`
- Affected product: COVID 19 Testing Management System (CTMS) 1.0
- Example payloads: `27325265' or 8079=8079--` and `35638130' or 9157=9162--`

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is described as "Critical and awful."
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) and further details are available on the nu11secur1ty blog, the provided links for github and the blog are included.
