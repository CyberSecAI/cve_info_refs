MING THE MODULE

[![CI](https://github.com/libming/libming/workflows/CI/badge.svg)](https://github.com/libming/libming/workflows/CI/badge.svg)

Last updated 22nd July 2020.

Ming is a Flash (SWF) output library. It can be used from PHP, Perl,
Ruby, Python, C, C++, Java, and probably more on the way.

It comprises a lot of Flash functionality, including features of Flash 8.

Specifically, it lets you create: shapes (including morphs), text, sprites
(aka movie clips), buttons, and actions in flash movies, plus more.

The goal for Ming is to abstract away all of the mundane specifics of the
SWF file format.

Ming also includes a PHP wrapper which wraps Ming objects in PHP objects.
Pretty cool.

The Python wrapper has been updated to mirror the functionality of the PHP
interface, so you should be able to use the PHP documentation without
getting terribly confused now.

There's a Perl wrapper now, feedback about it (and enhancements) are most
welcome.

The C++ wrapper is just one big header file. But it seems to work pretty
well. Check the examples directory.

Ming is released under the `LGPL`. See file `LICENSE` for the gory details.
The command-line actionscript compiler is released under the `GPL`. See
file `LICENSE_GPL2` for details.

For installation instructions, see the `INSTALL` text file.
