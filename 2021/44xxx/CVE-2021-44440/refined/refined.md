- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory corruption due to improper handling of specially crafted JT files during parsing by the JTTK library.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Memory corruption (CWE-119).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a maliciously crafted JT file with an affected product (JT Utilities or software using JTTK).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted JT file to a user of an affected product, and trick them into opening it. This likely requires social engineering, but no specific privileges are needed (PR:N, User Interaction Required)
