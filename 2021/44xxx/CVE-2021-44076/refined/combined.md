CRUSHFTP
IS A ROBUST FILE TRANSFER SERVER THAT MAKES IT EASY TO SETUP
SECURE CONNECTIONS WITH YOUR USERS.

'Crush' comes from the built-in zip methods in CrushFTP. They
allow for downloading files in compressed formats in-stream,
or even automatically expanding zip files as they are received
in-stream. This is called ZipStreaming and can greatly
accelerate the transfer of many types of files.

Secure management is web based allowing you the ability to
manage and monitor the server from anywhere, or with almost
any device. Easy in place server upgrades without complicated
installers. Runs as a daemon, or Windows service with no need
for a local GUI.

CrushFTP is watching out for you by detecting common hack
attempts and robots which scan for weak passwords. It will
automatically protect you against DDoS attacks. No need for you
to do anything as CrushFTP will automatically ban these IPs to
prevent wasted logging and CPU usage. This keeps your server
secure from unwanted abuse.

User management includes inheritance, groups, and virtual file
systems. If you want simple user management, it can be as easy
as just making a folder with a specific name and nothing else.
Think about how easily you can delegate user administration with
CrushFTP's role based adminstration and event configuration.

# CVE-2021-44076: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in CrushFTP

Stavros Manis

14 Sep 2022

During the course of our work, LRQA have identified a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability within the CrushFTP web interface.

[CrushFTP](https://www.crushftp.com/index.html) is a file transfer server which supports multiple file transfer protocols, and provides a web interface for users to manage their files, as well as for administrators to manage and monitor the service.

## Background

Within the `/WebInterface/UserManager` page of the web interface, there is an option to create a new user. Although client-side sanitization of input prevents the creation of a user whose username contains special characters, the same is not true for the server-side validation of the given data. An attacker who intercepts and modifies the traffic before the username is added to the application’s backend can create a user that contains JavaScript or HTML within the username property.

As shown below, there is a list of the most visited users displayed at the top of the page.

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/graphical-user-interface-application-description.png)

The list consists of `<a>` HTML tags that contain each username. The double-quote character is not properly sanitized inside the `<a>` tag allowing the insertion of JavaScript or HTML payloads within a username field, leading to [cross-site scripting](https://labs.nettitude.com/blog/more-xss-shenanigans/). In addition to this, the payload would also be executed when an attempt is made to delete the user. This is because the pop-up message that appears for confirmation does not encode usernames upon output, thus allowing crafted JavaScript or HTML payloads to be executed within the web browser.

## Exploitation

CrushFTP stores the details of registered users within the filesystem in the `users/MainUsers` directory. The contents of this directory are shown below, with the users `crushadmin`, `default`, and `TempAccount` each having their own directory.

![Text Description automatically generated](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/text-description-automatically-generated.png)

The user’s directory contains a file called `user.XML`, which contains the data associated with the account. This is where information such as the username, password, etc, is stored in XML format.

![Text Description automatically generated](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/text-description-automatically-generated-1.png)

When attempting to create a user, after a request to check if the username already exists, the application performs a POST request towards the `/WebInterface/function/` endpoint. The command used within the request is `setUserItem` which creates the user folder in the application’s backend containing the given information.

![Text Description automatically generated](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/text-description-automatically-generated-2.png)

The text highlighted below in red is the name of the directory that will be created for the user, while the text highlighted in blue is the username that will be saved within their `user.XML` file. LRQA modified this request, placing the value `random_user1` within the username POST parameter and `random_user2` within the username parameter in the XML data.

![Text Description automatically generated](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/text-description-automatically-generated-3.png)

The new user then appeared within the users panel on the left hand side of the page.

![](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/word-image-15535-6.png)

From this, it was clear that the web application indexes the username by the name of the directory created for the user, and not by the username that is added in the `user.XML` file. LRQA reproduced the previous steps, but this time replacing the username parameter with `random_user"<img+src%3d1+onerror%3d"alert(1)">`. This payload is designed to display a JavaScript alert when rendered within a web browser.

![Text Description automatically generated](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/text-description-automatically-generated-4.png)

The application failed to validate the integrity of the data server-side, and the user’s folder was created with the payload included, as shown below.

![Text Description automatically generated](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/text-description-automatically-generated-5.png)

After the operation was completed, the newly created user appeared within the users panel.

![A picture containing table Description automatically generated](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/a-picture-containing-table-description-automatica.png)

The `mostVisitedLinks` list was also populated with the most visited users’ profiles.

![](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/word-image-15535-10.png)

Since the username had been tampered with and no output encoding was performed prior to adding the username to the user attribute of the `<a>` object, the double-quote of the user attribute was escaped, and the `<img>` tag that was injected in the username was rendered within the page.

![](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/word-image-15535-11.png)

Given that an invalid image source was used within the payload, this meant that the `onerror` JavaScript event was triggered and the script executed.

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/graphical-user-interface-application-description-1.png)

If an attempt was made to delete the user, the payload would fire again in the pop-up window that appears.

![Graphical user interface, application Description automatically generated](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/graphical-user-interface-application-description-2.png)

The impact of a cross-site scripting attack can vary depending on the [payload](https://labs.nettitude.com/blog/cross-site-scripting-xss-payload-generator/) used, but it can usually be exploited for theft of information such as session cookies or other sensitive data, or to conduct unauthorised actions on behalf of an affected user. In this instance it may be exploited for privilege escalation or account takeover.

## Conclusion

This vulnerability affected CrushFTP prior to version 9.4.0\_15. Any later versions are no longer affected by this vulnerability, as the vendor was informed and performed the necessary actions to remediate the issue.

Multiple parts of the source code contribute to the payload’s execution in various fields, but the main reason behind the vulnerability is the incorrect sanitization of the username as it is processed within the backend. This, can be found in the `setUserItem` function inside the `crushftp/server/AdminControls.class` file.

![Graphical user interface Description automatically generated with medium confidence](/globalassets/cyber-labs/cve-2021-44076-cross-site-scripting-xss-in-crushftp/graphical-user-interface-description-automaticall.png)

No input filtering was performed on the username, so special characters entered in the username field are not removed or sanitized in any way. In addition to this, no output encoding was performed when the data was displayed within the affected page itself. Proper output encoding, in combination with a [strong content security policy](https://csp-evaluator.withgoogle.com/), should always be used to mitigate the risk of cross-site scripting.
