- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The JTTK library contains an out-of-bounds write past a fixed-length heap-based buffer while parsing specially crafted JT files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a maliciously crafted JT file with an affected product.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious JT file and trick a user into opening it with a vulnerable application. This does not require any special privileges, but does require user interaction.
