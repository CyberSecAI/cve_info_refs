- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `ok_png_transform_scanline` function of the `ok_png.c` file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-buffer-overflow due to improper bounds checking when processing image data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can lead to a crash, denial of service, and potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited. ASAN reports a write of size 1 at an address outside allocated memory. 
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted PNG file. The provided PoC file `heap-buffer-overflow-5.png` triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide a crafted PNG file as input to the vulnerable application, specifically to the `ok_png_read` function, which leads to the vulnerable `ok_png_transform_scanline` function.
