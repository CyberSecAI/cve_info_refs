  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the `loadActionModules()` function in `controller/load-action-modules.js` not properly sanitizing or validating the `filePath` variable when loading action modules. The object assignment on line 163 (`sails.config.blueprints._controllers[identity.toLowerCase()] = action;`) can be exploited to pollute the prototype if the `filePath` variable is dynamically controlled by an attacker and includes a malicious payload.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Prototype Pollution (CWE-1321): The application is susceptible to prototype pollution due to the insecure handling of the `filePath` variable in `loadActionModules()` leading to arbitrary property injection.",
        "Lack of Input Validation: The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `filePath` input before using it in object property assignments, which allows an attacker to inject malicious payloads.",
        "Dynamic Control of `filePath`: When the application allows dynamic control over the `filePath` variable, it can be manipulated by attackers, thereby creating an avenue for property injection."
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject arbitrary properties into the prototype, leading to:\n  * Denial of Service (DoS) by modifying critical application properties and potentially crashing the application.\n  * Arbitrary Code Execution by injecting or modifying sensitive properties or functionalities within the application.\n  * Data Corruption or Manipulation by altering the behavior of application by injecting malicious properties.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by manipulating the `filePath` variable in `loadActionModules()` function of sails.js.  This can be achieved through:\n  * Manipulating input parameters (e.g. request parameters) that eventually control the `filePath` variable.\n  * If a developer incorrectly uses the `reloadActions()` API with unsanitized inputs that are used to determine the files to be loaded, a malicious `filePath` can be provided.",
      "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the following to exploit the vulnerability:\n * Ability to control input that affects the `filePath` variable.\n * Ability to trigger the `loadActionModules()` function either directly or through the application's control flow.\n * Knowledge of SailsJS internals, specifically the action loading mechanism."
    },
    "additional_details": "The provided content gives more details than the official CVE description by specifying the vulnerable code location (`lib/app/private/controller/load-action-modules.js`) and the specific function (`loadActionModules`). It also elaborates on how an attacker might control the `filePath` variable and the impact of successful exploitation. Additionally, the provided github issue discussion ([https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/7209](https://github.com/balderdashy/sails/issues/7209)) confirms that the `reloadActions()` API should never be used with untrusted data."
