Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The root cause is improper sanitization of user-controlled data, specifically within the `search` and `search_params` session variables related to contact searches in Roundcube. This lack of sanitization allows for SQL injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a SQL injection flaw. It arises from not properly sanitizing the `search` or `search_params` session variables before using them in database queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **SQL Injection:**  An attacker can potentially execute arbitrary SQL queries on the underlying database, potentially leading to:
  - Data exfiltration (reading sensitive data from the database)
  - Data modification (altering or deleting data)
  - Privilege escalation (gaining unauthorized access to the system)
  - Denial of Service

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector involves manipulating the `search` and/or `search_params` session variables during a contact search to inject malicious SQL code.
- This can be done through crafted requests to the Roundcube application that alter the session data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Roundcube application and be able to make requests that can manipulate the session data.
- The attacker would likely need to be an authenticated user of the Roundcube application to have a valid session.
- No specific system privileges are required besides being a user with the ability to perform actions that trigger the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Roundcube versions prior to 1.3.17 and 1.4.12.
- The fix involves renaming the session variables to avoid conflicts, ensuring that data related to contact searches does not interfere with other search-related functionalities.
- Patches for the vulnerability were released in Roundcube versions 1.3.17 and 1.4.12.
- The vulnerability is assigned CVE-2021-44026.
