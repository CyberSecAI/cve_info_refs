- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The underlying MQTT service of affected systems does not perform authentication in the default configuration.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Missing authentication for critical function (CWE-306).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can send arbitrary messages to the service and thereby issue arbitrary requests in the affected system, leading to potential unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Unauthenticated remote attacker with network access to the affected system.
