|  | CWE-697: Incorrect Comparison |
|  |  |
|  | [Vendor of Product] |
|  | unicorn-engine |
|  |  |
|  | [Affected Product Code Base] |
|  | unicorn engine - <=2.0.0 |
|  |  |
|  | [Affected Component] |
|  | uc.c, split\_region |
|  |  |
|  | [Attack Type] |
|  | Local |
|  |  |
|  | [Impact Code execution] |
|  | true |
|  |  |
|  | [Attack Vectors] |
|  | run specially crafted code withing unicorn with uc\_mem\_map\_ptr() and uc\_mem\_unmap() supported |
|  |  |
|  | [Description] |
|  | An issue was discovered in split\_region in uc.c in Unicorn Engine through 1.0.3 and 2.x through 2.0.0-rc4. |
|  | It allows local attackers to escape the sandbox. |
|  | An attacker must first |
|  | obtain the ability to execute crafted code in the target |
|  | sandbox in order to exploit this vulnerability. The specific flaw |
|  | exists within the virtual memory manager. The issue results from the |
|  | faulty comparison of GVA and GPA while calling uc\_mem\_map\_ptr to free |
|  | part of a claimed memory block. An attacker can leverage this |
|  | vulnerability to escape the sandbox and execute arbitrary code on the host |
|  | machine. |
