The provided content relates to CVE-2021-44557.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `lxml.etree.XMLParser` in the `ocr_to_dict` function within the `ner.py` file, which parses XML data retrieved from a user-supplied URL. The XML parser is not configured to disable external entity loading, making it vulnerable to XML External Entity (XXE) attacks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **XXE (XML External Entity) Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper configuration of the XML parser, which allows it to load external entities.
- **User-Controlled URL:** The application uses a URL provided by the user to fetch XML data, which opens up the attack vector.
- **Vulnerable Parser:** The usage of `lxml.etree.XMLParser` with default settings (i.e. not disabling external entities) makes the application vulnerable to XXE attacks.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read local files on the server by injecting malicious XML content that includes references to external entities (e.g., file:///etc/passwd).
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker could cause a denial of service by including malicious XML that leads to excessive resource consumption during parsing.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Malicious URL:** An attacker provides a malicious URL as input to the application. This URL would resolve to an XML document with malicious external entity declarations.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application and control the 'url' parameter, thereby being able to inject a malicious URL.
