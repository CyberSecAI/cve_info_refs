  "vulnerability_details": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-44044",
    "description": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists when reading a JPG file using Open Design Alliance Drawings SDK before 2022.11. The specific issue exists with parsing JPG files. Crafted data in a JPG (4 extraneous bytes before the marker 0xca) can trigger a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by crafted data in a JPG file (specifically, 4 extraneous bytes before the marker 0xca) that triggers a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Out-of-bounds Write",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.",
    "attack_vector": "To exploit the vulnerability, a malicious JPG file should be read using ODA Drawings SDK.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious JPG file with 4 extraneous bytes before the marker 0xca."
