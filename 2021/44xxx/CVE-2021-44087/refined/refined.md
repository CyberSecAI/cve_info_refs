{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application allows unauthenticated users to upload arbitrary PHP files via the `employee_edit_photo.php` endpoint, due to insufficient validation of the uploaded file.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Unrestricted file upload",
    "Remote code execution"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to full system compromise.",
  "Attack vectors": "HTTP POST request to the `/apsystem/admin/employee_edit_photo.php` endpoint with a malicious PHP file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is needed."
