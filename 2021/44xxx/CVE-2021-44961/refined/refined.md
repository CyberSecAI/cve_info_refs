{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `PerimeterGenerator` class in Slic3r libslic3r does not have a proper destructor, leading to memory leaks. The default destructor only destroys the pointers, but not the memory they point to.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Memory leak due to improper resource management within the `PerimeterGenerator` class.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A specially crafted STL file can exhaust available memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "By providing a malicious STL file to Slic3r with the `--export-gcode` argument.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted STL file to the vulnerable application."
