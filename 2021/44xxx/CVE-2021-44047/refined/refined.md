Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-44047:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a use-after-free issue that occurs during the parsing of DWF/DWFX files. The vulnerability is triggered due to a lack of proper validation of input data. Specifically, the issue arises from the lack of validating the existence of an object before operations are performed on that object. This can cause a write operation past the end of an allocated buffer when crafted data is present in the file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability
- Improper input validation
- Potential for out-of-bounds write

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- Potential for a denial-of-service (crash).

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious DWF/DWFX file needs to be read using ODA Drawings SDK.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to create a specially crafted DWF/DWFX file.
- The attacker must be able to get a user or system to open the malicious file with the vulnerable ODA Drawings SDK.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided text offers more detail than the typical CVE description, specifically regarding the root cause (lack of validation of object existence) and the specific file types affected.
