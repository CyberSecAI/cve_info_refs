Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by an **Out-of-bounds Read** error.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-125: Out-of-bounds Read:** The software reads data past the end, or before the beginning, of the intended buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to privilege escalation. The user context of the application is not specified.
*   **Information Disclosure**: Although not explicitly mentioned, an out-of-bounds read can lead to disclosure of sensitive information if the attacker can read memory outside the intended buffer. The CVSS vector includes "C:L" indicating low confidentiality impact.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack Vector:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction (UI:R). It is likely the vulnerability would be triggered when the user opens a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick a user into performing an action to trigger the vulnerability, such as opening a specially crafted file.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attack can be carried out without special privileges (PR:N).

**Additional Notes**
*   The CVSS score is 3.3 which is considered a Moderate severity.
*   The vulnerability affects Adobe After Effects versions 22.0 and earlier, and 18.4.2 and earlier on both Windows and macOS.
*   The issue is addressed in versions 22.1.1 and 18.4.3 of Adobe After Effects.
