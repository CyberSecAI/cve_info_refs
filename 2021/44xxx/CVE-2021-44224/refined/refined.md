Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-44224:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided documents explicitly mention `CVE-2021-44224` in the context of an Apache HTTP Server vulnerability, confirming relevance to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

   - **CVE-2021-44224**: A crafted URI sent to `httpd` configured as a forward proxy (ProxyRequests on) can cause a NULL pointer dereference or server-side request forgery (SSRF). This happens because the server does not properly handle the URI, leading to a crash or allowing requests to be directed to a Unix Domain Socket endpoint.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **NULL pointer dereference**: Improper handling of a crafted URI can cause the server to try to access memory via a NULL pointer, which causes a crash.
   - **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: Incorrect configurations, specifically those combining forward and reverse proxy declarations, can allow a malicious request to be redirected to an arbitrary Unix Domain Socket endpoint.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Denial of Service (DoS)**: The NULL pointer dereference leads to a crash, causing the service to be unavailable.
   - **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**: With a malicious request, an attacker could cause the proxy to forward to arbitrary destinations potentially exposing internal systems, leaking data or enabling further attacks.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - A crafted URI is sent to an Apache HTTP Server.
   - The server must be configured as a forward proxy (`ProxyRequests On`).
   - Configurations combining forward and reverse proxy declarations may allow an attacker to redirect requests to a declared Unix Domain Socket endpoint.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted HTTP request.
   - The attacker must be able to connect to the vulnerable Apache server.
   - No authentication is required, the vulnerability can be triggered by sending a request that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

   - The vulnerability is present in Apache HTTP Server versions 2.4.7 up to 2.4.51 (inclusive).
   - Fix is to update Apache HTTP Server to 2.4.52 or later, where the URI parsing logic is fixed.
   - The vulnerability is listed as high severity by Tenable with a CVSS v3 score of 8.2, and a CVSS v2 score of 6.4.
   - The vulnerability is also described as moderate by Openwall.
   - Several documents mention that this vulnerability has been fixed in different products by updating apache version to 2.4.53
