| dear all,  we've found bug in our revive about ck.php (oadest)  <https://revive.com/www/delivery/ck.php?oadest=https://evil.com> -> it will be redirect to url destination  we read this url <https://packetstormsecurity.com/files/152671/REVIVE-SA-2019-001.txt> that we should upgrade version, but this bug (as we think is a bug) still can open redirect  this is issue will harm our site and the victims could be redirect to phissing website  could you guide us what we should do again, even after upgrade version 4.2.1 still can open redirect |

### **[erikgeurts](/erikgeurts)** commented [Jun 24, 2019](#issuecomment-504880544)

| Thanks for your report. The behavior you noticed is there by design. I'll explain below.  One of the core requirements of an adserver is to not only redirect users to the destination when they click on a banner, but to also track that the click has happened. To do this successfully, click actions on banners need to firstly come to Revive Adserver, to record the click, and then redirect the user.  One solution to ensure that arbitrary URL redirection behavior ("Open Redirects") is prevented would be to record the destination URL for each banner in the database, and to then redirect based on the banner that was clicked.  However, this would require that Revive Adserver knows the destination URL for every banner, which would then mean that external banners from other networks could not be used.  As a result, we typically do not treat Open Redirects as a security vulnerability, as most users of the software actually require the ability to redirect to supplied, non-verified URLs from the software. Changing the software to prevent Open Redirects would effectively prevent users from doing what they actually want the software to do. |

| For actual vulnerability reports, we strongly recommend you first study <https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/> and then use <https://hackerone.com/revive_adserver> to report them. Posting a vulnerability publicly on Github is **never** a good idea, for any project. |

# Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2021-001

* Advisory ID: REVIVE-SA-2021-001
* CVE-IDs:¬†CVE-2021-22871,¬†CVE-2021-22872,¬†CVE-2021-22873
* Date: 2021-01-19
* Risk Level: Low
* Applications affected: Revive Adserver
* Versions affected: <= 5.0.5
* Versions not affected: >= 5.1.0
* Website: <https://www.revive-adserver.com/>

## Vulnerability 1 ‚Äì Persistent XSS

* Vulnerability type:¬†Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page¬†Generation (‚ÄòCross-site Scripting‚Äô)[CWE-79]
* CVE-ID:¬†[CVE-2021-22871](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22871)
* CVSSv3.1 Vector:¬†AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
* CVSS Base Score: 3.5
* CVSS Impact Subscore: 2.5
* CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 0.9

### Description

A persistent XSS vulnerability has been discovered by security¬†researcher Keyur Vala. An attacker with manager account credential could¬†store HTML code in a website property, which could subsequently been¬†displayed unescaped on a specific page by other users in the system.

### Details

Any user with a manager account could store specifically crafted content¬†in the URL website property which was then displayed unsanitised in the¬†affiliate-preview.php tag generation screen, potentially by other users¬†in the system, allowing a persistent XSS attack to take place.¬†The target users would however mostly have access to the same resources¬†as the attacker, so the practical applications are not considered¬†particularly harmful, especially since the session cookie cannot be¬†accessed via JavaScript.

## Vulnerability 2 ‚Äì Reflected XSS

* Vulnerability type:¬†Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page¬†Generation (‚ÄòCross-site Scripting‚Äô)[CWE-79]
* CVE-ID:¬†[CVE-2021-22872](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22872)
* CVSSv3.1 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
* CVSS Base Score: 4.3
* CVSS Impact Subscore: 1.4
* CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 2.8

### Description

Security researcher Axel Flamcourt has discovered that the fix for the¬†reflected XSS vulnerability in REVIVE-SA-2020-001 could be bypassed on¬†older browsers with specifically crafted payloads to the publicly¬†accessible afr.php delivery script of Revive Adserver. The practical¬†applications are not considered particularly harmful, especially since¬†the session cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript.

### Details

The previous fix was working on most modern browsers, but some older¬†browsers are not automatically url-encoding parameters and would leave¬†an opportunity to inject closing and opening script tags and achieve¬†reflected XSS attacks e.g. on IE11.

## Vulnerability 3 ‚Äì¬†Open Redirect

* Vulnerability type:¬†URL Redirection to Untrusted Site¬†(‚ÄòOpen Redirect‚Äô) [CWE-601]
* CVE-ID:¬†[CVE-2021-22873](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22873)
* CVSSv3.1 Vector:¬†AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
* CVSS Base Score: 5.4
* CVSS Impact Subscore: 2.5
* CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 2.8

### Description

An opportunity for open redirects has been available by design since the¬†early versions of Revive Adserver‚Äôs predecessors in the impression and¬†click tracking scripts to allow third party ad servers to track such¬†metrics when delivering ads. Historically the display advertising¬†industry has considered that to be a feature, not a real vulnerability.¬†Things have evolved since then and third party click tracking via¬†redirects is not a viable option anymore, therefore any functionality¬†using open redirects in delivery scripts have been removed from Revive¬†Adserver.

### Details

The lg.php and ck.php delivery scripts were subject to open redirect via¬†either dest, oadest and/or ct0 parameters. All of them are now ignored¬†and redirects only performed (when applicable) to destination URLs¬†stored in the properties of the banner being displayed. A new signed¬†click delivery script has been introduced with an HMAC signed¬†destination parameter, allowing customisable destination URLs while¬†avoiding destinations from being tampered with by attackers.
