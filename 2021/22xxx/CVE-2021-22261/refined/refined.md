{
  "CVE-2021-22261": {
    "root_cause": "GitLab does not sanitize the 'key' field in the JSON response from the Jira API, leading to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper sanitization of user-controlled input.",
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when the victim views a Jira issue detail page. This allows the attacker to perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially compromising their account, data, or performing other malicious activities.",
     "attack_vectors": "An attacker configures a malicious Jira API endpoint that returns a specially crafted JSON response containing a malicious payload in the 'key' field. When GitLab retrieves data from this malicious API endpoint and displays it on the Jira issue detail pages, the payload is executed in the victim's browser.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create a malicious Jira API endpoint.",
      "Ability to configure Jira integration within a GitLab project that is on a premium or ultimate tier",
      "Knowledge of the vulnerable field/parameter"
    ]
