Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-22888:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper neutralization of input during web page generation in `campaign-zone-zones.php`. Specifically, the `status` parameter was not fully escaped when printed within an HTML attribute.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious HTML and/or JavaScript code.
- The injected script is executed in the context of a victim's browser session when they click on a malicious crafted link.
- The impact is limited because the session cookie cannot be accessed or stolen via JavaScript. This means the attacker can't directly impersonate a user but could redirect the user to an attacker controlled page or perform other malicious activities in the context of the user session.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the unescaped javascript code in the `status` parameter.
- An authenticated user with access to the Revive Adserver UI needs to click on the malicious crafted link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking the malicious URL. The user must have access to the user interface of a Revive Adserver instance.
