The provided content is related to CVE-2021-22684.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Integer overflow in memory allocation functions. Specifically, the `_calloc` and `mm_zalloc` functions within Samsung Tizen RT RTOS version 3.0.GBB are vulnerable to an integer wrap-around.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Integer overflow or wraparound (CWE-190) leads to improper memory assignment.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Arbitrary memory allocation, resulting in unexpected behavior such as a crash.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local with high attack complexity.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs local access to the system. Exploitation requires specific conditions to trigger the integer overflow during memory allocation, making it a high complexity attack.
