The provided content is related to CVE-2021-22300.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A command within the affected Huawei product lacks a timeout exit mechanism.
- Sensitive information is written to a temporary file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Leakage: The combination of the lack of timeout and sensitive information in a temporary file results in the vulnerability.
- Inter-Process Access: The vulnerability is exploitable through inter-process access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially obtain sensitive information by accessing the temporary file through inter-process communication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Inter-process access is the primary attack vector.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have the ability to access the affected process to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
