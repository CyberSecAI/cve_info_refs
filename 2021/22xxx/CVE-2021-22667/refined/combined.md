* **CVSS v3 9.8**
* **ATTENTION:** Exploitable remotely/low skill level to exploit
* **Vendor:** Advantech
* **Equipment:** BB-ESWGP506-2SFP-T
* **Vulnerability:** Use of Hard-coded Credentials

## 2. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information and execute arbitrary code.

## 3. TECHNICAL DETAILS

### 3.1 AFFECTED PRODUCTS

The following Advantech products are affected:

* BB-ESWGP506-2SFP-T industrial ethernet switches: Versions 1.01.09 and prior

### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [USE OF HARD-CODED CREDENTIALS CWE-798](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html)

The affected product is vulnerable due to the use of hard-coded credentials, which may allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access and permit the execution of arbitrary code.

[CVE-2021-22667](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22667) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

### 3.3 BACKGROUND

* **CRITICAL INFRASTRUCTURE SECTORS:** Multiple Sectors
* **COUNTRIES/AREAS DEPLOYED:** East Asia, United States, Europe
* **COMPANY HEADQUARTERS LOCATION:** Taiwan

### 3.4 RESEARCHER

An anonymous researcher working with Trend Micro’s Zero Day Initiative reported this vulnerability to CISA.

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Advantech no longer sells or maintains BB-ESWGP506-2SFP-T and considers it to be an end-of-life product.

Advantech recommends users replace the device with a succeeding model such as EKI-7708-4FPI.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize that VPN is only as secure as the connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target this vulnerability.
