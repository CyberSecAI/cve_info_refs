  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A recent change introduced the ability for Project Members with the role of Guest to add meta-data when creating a new issue, but inadvertently allowed users who were not members of the project to also set assignees, milestone, and labels during issue creation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient access control during issue creation.",
      "Incorrectly granted permissions to non-project members."
    ],
    "impact": "Non-project members can manipulate issue meta-data (assignees, milestone, and labels) upon issue creation, potentially leading to confusion, incorrect task assignments, and unauthorized modification of project planning.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "An attacker, without being a member of the project, can create a new issue.",
      "During issue creation, the attacker can set arbitrary meta-data such as assignees, milestone and labels."
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to access the GitLab instance and attempt to create a new issue in a project where they are not a member."
