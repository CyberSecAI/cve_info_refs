- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions. Specifically, the vulnerability occurs when the Triconex Main Processor (MP) Models 3009 and 3009X receive malformed TriStation packets while the write-protect keyswitch is in the PROGRAM position.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  CWE-754: Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions. The system fails to properly handle malformed TriStation packets, leading to a module reset.

- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful exploit can cause a module reset, leading to a denial-of-service condition.

- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves sending malformed TriStation packets to the affected modules (3009/3009X MP).

- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the device to set the write-protect keyswitch to the PROGRAM position. The attacker also needs the ability to send malformed TriStation packets. The attacker must have high privileges to set the keyswitch. User interaction is required as well, as the operator must put the keyswitch in the program position.
