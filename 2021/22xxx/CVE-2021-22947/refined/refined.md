Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2021-22947:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The provided content directly mentions **CVE-2021-22947** in several sources, including:
    *   Debian LTS Advisory DLA-3085-1
    *   Debian Security Advisory DSA-5197-1
    *   Apple Security Advisory macOS Monterey 12.3
    *   Fedora 33 Update
    *   Oracle CPU October 2021
    *   Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 202212-01

* The CVE description is consistent across all sources: a vulnerability in curl where servers could inject data when a client uses STARTTLS.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the way curl handles the STARTTLS handshake.  Specifically, the client does not correctly flush cached responses after upgrading to TLS.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   Improper handling of cached responses before a TLS upgrade.
    *   Lack of sufficient verification of responses received before the TLS upgrade.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A man-in-the-middle attacker can inject fake response data, potentially leading to:
    *   Data manipulation
    *   Information Disclosure (potentially of authentication headers or cookies)
    *   Bypassing expected TLS security
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack.
    *   A malicious server sending crafted, pre-TLS responses to the client.
*   **Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and modify network traffic between a client using curl and a server.
    *   The attacker must be able to present themself as the legitimate server to the client.
    *   The attacker must be able to send responses before a TLS upgrade and during the TLS upgrade itself.

**3. Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerabilities related to curl generally involve improper handling of TLS handshakes, which can lead to issues such as partial leaks of passwords over the network, incorrect connection usage, overwriting of local files, use-after-free conditions, uncontrolled recursion, improper certificate validations, etc.
*   Specific to **CVE-2021-22947**, the official descriptions highlight a flaw in the clientâ€™s response caching mechanism when using STARTTLS and the lack of clearing the pre-TLS handshake responses when TLS is activated. This allows for a MITM attacker to inject fake responses before a secure channel is fully established.

**4. Additional Notes:**

*   Some sources, like the Oracle and Debian advisories, list other curl-related CVEs alongside CVE-2021-22947, indicating that the fixes often address multiple vulnerabilities at once. These CVEs (like CVE-2021-22945 and CVE-2021-22946) are often related to the TLS handshake or improper handling of certain protocols.
*   Multiple sources mention that upgrading curl to version 7.79.1 or higher is the proper remediation. Specific affected versions vary by vendor, but the underlying issue is consistent.
*   The Oracle CPU notes that patches for CVE-2021-22947 also address CVE-2021-22897 and CVE-2021-22898.
*   The Debian Security Advisory DSA-5197-1 states that this vulnerability could allow remote attackers to obtain sensitive information, leak authentication or cookie header data or facilitate a denial of service attack.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**

CVE-2021-22947 describes a vulnerability in curl stemming from the incorrect handling of cached responses before a TLS upgrade in STARTTLS connections. A MITM attacker could exploit this to inject fake server responses and potentially leak sensitive information, bypass required TLS encryption, or facilitate denial of service.  The recommended mitigation is to upgrade curl to version 7.79.1 or later, which addresses this and other related vulnerabilities.
