Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22144:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from uncontrolled recursion within the Elasticsearch Grok parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Uncontrolled Recursion (CWE-674) in the Grok parser of Elasticsearch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Denial of Service (DoS): A successful attack can crash the Elasticsearch node, making the service unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the submission of arbitrary queries to Elasticsearch.
*   A specifically crafted malicious Grok query triggers the uncontrolled recursion, leading to the crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be a user with the capability to submit arbitrary queries to Elasticsearch.
*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided document from netapp.com indicates that multiple NetApp products incorporate Elasticsearch, but none are vulnerable to this specific CVE. The advisory NTAP-20210827-0006 addresses CVE-2021-22144 and CVE-2021-22145. The advisory lists the affected products as “None” and provides a list of "Products Not Affected".
*   The discuss.elastic.co content provides more details on the vulnerability (ESA-2021-15). It also highlights the affected versions of Elasticsearch.
*   The oracle.com content does not directly relate to CVE-2021-22144 but mentions the mitigation of multiple vulnerabilities in Oracle products. A patch for the CVE-2021-22132 is referenced in the Oracle document, which also addresses CVE-2021-22144. However, this is not the main topic of the document.
