The provided content is related to CVE-2021-22680.

**Root Cause:** Integer overflow or wraparound in memory allocation functions.

**Vulnerabilities:**
- The NXP MQX RTOS versions 5.1 and prior, are vulnerable to integer overflows in `mem_alloc`, `_lwmem_alloc` and `_partition` functions. This leads to incorrect calculation of memory allocation size.

**Impact:**
- Exploitation can lead to arbitrary memory allocation, resulting in unexpected behavior such as a crash, or remote code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based and does not require user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker can be remote and does not require any special privileges or user interaction.
