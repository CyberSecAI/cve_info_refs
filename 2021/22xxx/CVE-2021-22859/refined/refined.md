Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22859

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the EXCELLENT INFOTEK BiYan application. Specifically, the `<LOGIN_ID>` parameter within the `query_user_data.aspx` page is vulnerable to manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or parameterized queries when handling the `<LOGIN_ID>` parameter. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.
*   **Pre-authentication bypass:** The vulnerability is exploitable without prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers can retrieve sensitive information, including user accounts and passwords.
*   **Data Modification:** Attackers can modify data, such as changing user passwords.
*   **Compromised Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the system and its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Request:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious HTTP request to the `query_user_data.aspx` page with a specially crafted `<LOGIN_ID>` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system.
*   **No Authentication:** No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Versions:** EXCELLENT INFOTEK BiYan versions 2.9 to 3.0 are vulnerable.
*   **Affected File:** The vulnerable file is `query_user_data.aspx` located under the `/kw/docn/asp/` directory of the web application.
*   The SQL injection vulnerability allows execution of arbitrary SQL commands.
