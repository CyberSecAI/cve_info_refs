- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The "Sensitive Headers" functionality in Spring Cloud Netflix Zuul can be bypassed with specially crafted URLs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the way Spring Cloud Netflix Zuul handles URLs when processing "Sensitive Headers". It fails to properly restrict header information when URLs are manipulated, allowing attackers to potentially expose sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to the bypass of the "Sensitive Headers" restriction, potentially exposing sensitive header information that should have been filtered. The severity is rated as MEDIUM.
- **Attack vectors:**  Attackers can exploit this by crafting URLs in a specific way to bypass the "Sensitive Headers" restrictions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker would need to be able to send requests with manipulated URLs to the vulnerable Zuul instance.
