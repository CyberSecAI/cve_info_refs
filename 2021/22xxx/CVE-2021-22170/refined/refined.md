Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper implementation of AES-GCM encryption in the `Gitlab::CryptoHelper` module, used for encrypting sensitive token values in the database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Static Key and Nonce:** The implementation uses a static key and a static Initialization Vector (IV) / nonce for AES-GCM. The key and IV are derived from `Gitlab::Application.secrets.db_key_base`, with the IV being a substring of the key. This is not secure as IVs should be unique for each encryption operation with the same key.
*   **Key and IV Relationship:** The IV is a substring of the key, which is not recommended even if not directly exploitable.
*   **Reduced Key/IV Length:**  `Gitlab::Application.secrets.db_key_base` is a hexadecimal string. This results in the effective length of both IV and the key being half of their intended size.
*   **Nonce Reuse:** The static nonce leads to nonce reuse, a critical flaw in AES-GCM, which allows for recovery of the authentication key.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Authentication Tag Forgery:** By observing two different ciphertexts and their corresponding authentication tags, an attacker can forge authentication tags for arbitrary ciphertexts. This allows them to modify encrypted data.
*   **Keystream Deduction:** If an attacker knows a plaintext/ciphertext pair (e.g., from a project's runner token), they can deduce the keystream. This keystream can then be used to encrypt arbitrary values up to the length of the known plaintext.

**Attack Vectors:**
* An attacker needs to observe at least two ciphertexts and their respective authentication tags to forge new tags.
* An attacker needs access to a known plaintext/ciphertext pair to deduce the keystream and encrypt arbitrary data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker would need to be able to observe encrypted tokens within the database
*   The attacker would need to have access to existing plaintext token values to abuse the keystream deduction vulnerability

**Additional Notes:**
* The provided information includes a suggested fix of storing a random IV along with the encrypted value and deriving the key from `Gitlab::Application.secrets.db_key_base` with PBKDF2.
