- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the use of hard-coded credentials within the charging station's web server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a CWE-798: Use of Hard-coded Credentials. This means that the system contains credentials that are not unique and are not dynamically generated, making them easily exploitable.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to issue unauthorized commands to the charging station's web server with administrative privileges. This could lead to significant tampering of the charging station, denial-of-service attacks, unauthorized usage of the station, service interruptions, failure to send charging data, modification of configuration, and potential disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N), meaning the attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely over a network. Physical access to the device is not required to exploit this vulnerability, as long as the attacker has network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not require any special privileges (PR:N), nor do they require user interaction (UI:N) to exploit this vulnerability. The attacker only needs to have network access to the charging station's web server, typically over the internet if not properly secured.

This vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS v3.1 Base Score of 9.4.
