The provided content includes release notes for Concrete CMS version 8.5.7, which addresses CVE-2021-22966.

**CVE-2021-22966**

*   **Root Cause:** A privilege escalation vulnerability existed where users in a group with "view" permissions on the bulk update page could elevate their privileges to administrator status. This was achieved by using a specially crafted curl request.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Insufficient permission checks on the bulk update functionality.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An editor-level user could gain full administrative access to the Concrete CMS instance.

*  **Attack Vectors:** A malicious actor with low privileges (editor) would need to craft a specific curl request to trigger the vulnerability through the bulk update page.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be a user in a group with "view" permission on the bulkupdate page.

The fix involved adding a bulk update permission security check.
