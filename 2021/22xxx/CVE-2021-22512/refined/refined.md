The provided content is related to CVE-2021-22512.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation and does not require POST requests for these methods.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission checks in form validation methods
- CSRF vulnerability due to lack of POST request requirement

**Impact of exploitation:**
Attackers with Overall/Read permission can connect to attacker-specified URLs using attacker-specified username and password.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable form validation endpoints.
- Exploiting the lack of CSRF protection by tricking a user into submitting a malicious request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission.
- The attacker can be remote.
