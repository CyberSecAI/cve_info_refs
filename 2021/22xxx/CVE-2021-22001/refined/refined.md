- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Sensitive information, specifically the relaying secret of the identity provider (IdP), was being exposed in the response when a deletion request for an OAuth 1.0 type IdP was sent to the UAA server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information leakage of sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could gain access to external IdPs by obtaining the leaked secret from the UAA server.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a deletion request for an OAuth 1.0 type IdP to the UAA server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the UAA server. The specific privileges needed to send the deletion request are not specified.
