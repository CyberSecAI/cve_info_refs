The content is related to CVE-2021-22161.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
A routing loop can occur on IPv6 point-to-point links when a link prefix route points to the same point-to-point link. This is triggered when the destination IPv6 address belongs to the prefix and is not a local IPv6 address. The router will send the packet back to the point to point link due to the prefix route, creating a "ping pong" effect with the upstream ISP router. This occurs specifically when router advertisements are received with a global unique IPv6 prefix where the on-link flag is set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper handling of IPv6 routing on point-to-point links.
- The presence of the link prefix route in the routing table, which leads to packets being routed back to the same interface
- Lack of an unreachable route to prevent the routing loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A routing loop can cause excessive traffic on the point-to-point link, potentially leading to network congestion and service disruption.
- The "ping pong" effect may impact the router's performance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when the router receives router advertisements containing a global unique IPv6 prefix with the on-link flag set.
- An attacker on the same IPv6 network can send packets with a destination IP matching the vulnerable prefix.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be on the IPv6 network that's connected to the point-to-point link.
- The attacker needs to be able to send IPv6 packets to the router with a destination IP belonging to a specific prefix.
- No specific user privileges are required.
