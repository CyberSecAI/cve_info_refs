Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-22716:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **CWE-732: Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource:** The vulnerability stems from improper permission assignment, where an unprivileged user can modify critical files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incorrect Permission Assignment:** The primary weakness is that the C-Bus Toolkit allows an unprivileged user to modify files that should only be modifiable by higher-privileged users or processes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to remote code execution. This would allow an attacker to run arbitrary code on the affected system.
*   **Full Compromise:** The impact is classified as High, potentially allowing an attacker to completely compromise the system with full control.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local access (AV:L), implying that the attacker needs to have some form of access to the machine on which C-Bus Toolkit is running.
*   **Unprivileged User:**  The attacker needs to be an unprivileged user (PR:L), meaning that the attacker does not require administrator privileges to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the machine running the vulnerable C-Bus Toolkit.
*   **Unprivileged Account:** The attacker can utilize an unprivileged user account on the system.
*   **Ability to Modify Files:** The attacker needs to be able to modify files, which they can do as an unprivileged user due to the misconfigured permissions.

**Summary**

CVE-2021-22716 details a vulnerability where an unprivileged user can modify files they should not have access to, which then could allow an attacker to perform a remote code execution.
