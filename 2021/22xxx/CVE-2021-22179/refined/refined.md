{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the `validate!` function within GitLab's URL blocker. The function's logic incorrectly checks if an IP address is allowed before enforcing DNS rebinding protection. This allows an attacker to bypass the intended DNS rebinding protection if any local IP address is allowed.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper implementation of DNS rebinding protection, specifically the order of checks in the `validate!` function within `lib/gitlab/url_blocker.rb`. The vulnerability is caused by checking if the target IP is allowed before enforcing the hostname, instead of checking after the hostname enforcement. This flaw allows an attacker to bypass the DNS rebinding protection mechanism.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can bypass the DNS rebinding protection and gain access to internal network resources. This allows an attacker to perform SSRF attacks, and potentially extract data or execute commands on internal services that are not intended to be publicly accessible. In this case, the attacker was able to retrieve the content of the Redis database.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by creating a malicious URL that utilizes DNS rebinding to bypass the configured IP address restrictions. Specifically, an attacker would create a URL containing a domain name that resolves to an allowed IP address and another malicious IP address in the same URL using a DNS rebinding technique. This URL can then be used within webhooks.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to create or modify webhooks in a project within the GitLab instance. This requires the attacker to have a user account with sufficient permissions to create or edit webhooks. The attacker also needs knowledge about internal IP addresses or must use a brute force approach to find valid targets within the network by testing each IP address one by one"
