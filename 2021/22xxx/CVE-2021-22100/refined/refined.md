- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A misbehaving service broker, either accidentally or maliciously, can cause Cloud Controller (CC) instances to timeout and fail due to excessive requests.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Cloud Controller (CAPI) is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack due to insufficient handling of service broker requests. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper concurrency control for service broker requests, allowing a malicious or faulty broker to overwhelm the CC instances.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to cause a denial of service, making it impossible for anyone to push or manage applications. This leads to a complete outage of the Cloud Foundry environment's application management capabilities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves pushing a service broker that causes CC instances to timeout and fail.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker requires the ability to push service brokers to the Cloud Foundry environment. This would typically require a developer or administrative role with the necessary permissions.
