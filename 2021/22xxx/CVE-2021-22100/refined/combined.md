## Severity

Medium

## Vendor

Cloud Foundry Foundation

## Description

Cloud Controller (CAPI) is vulnerable to a denial-of-service attack in which a developer can push a service broker that (accidentally or maliciously) causes CC instances to timeout and fail. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to cause an inability for anyone to push or manage apps.

## Affected Cloud Foundry Products and Versions

*Severity is medium unless otherwise noted.*

* CAPI
  + All versions prior to 1.122.0
* CF Deployment
  + All versions prior to 17.1.0

## Mitigation

Users of affected products are strongly encouraged to follow the mitigations below. The Cloud Foundry project recommends upgrading the following releases:

* CAPI
  + Upgrade all versions to 1.122.0 or greater
* CF Deployment
  + Upgrade all versions to 17.1.0 or greater

```
**and** configure [cc.max_concurrent_service_broker_requests](<https://bosh.io/jobs/cloud_controller_ng?source=github.com/cloudfoundry/capi-release&version=1.122.0#p%3dcc.max_concurrent_service_broker_requests>) to a reasonable value (e.g. 3).

```
