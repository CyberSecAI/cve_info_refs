##### **2. Introduction**

Multiple vulnerabilities were privately reported to VMware. Patches are available to address this vulnerability in affected VMware products.

##### **3a. Server Side Request Forgery vulnerability in VMware Workspace ONE Access (CVE-2021-22056)**

**Description**

VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager, contain a Server Side Request Forgery. VMware has evaluated this issue to be of Moderate severity with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 5.5.

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with network access may be able to make HTTP requests to arbitrary origins and read the full response.

**Resolution**

Fixes for CVE-2021-22056 are documented in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Workarounds**

None

**Additional Documentation**

None

**Notes**

[1] The patches listed in the "Fixed Version" column of the table below address the Apache log4j security issue identified by CVE-2021-44228 (this is documented in [VMSA-2021-0028](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0028.html)). For Access 21.08.0.1 and vRealize Automation 8.x consult [VMSA-2021-0028](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0028.html) for information on mitigation of CVE-2021-44228.
[2] vRealize Automation 8.x is unaffected since it does not use embedded vIDM. If vIDM has been deployed with vRA 8.x, fixes should be applied directly to vIDM.
[3] vRealize Automation 7.6 is affected since it uses embedded vIDM.
