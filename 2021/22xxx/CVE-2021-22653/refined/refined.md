Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-22653:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an out-of-bounds write issue that occurs when the application processes project files. This vulnerability stems from improper handling of data, allowing an attacker to write data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-Bounds Write (CWE-787): The application writes data beyond the intended buffer boundaries when processing project files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the privileges of the application. This may lead to a variety of impacts, including:
- Confidentiality breach
- Integrity compromise
- Availability disruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Attackers need to craft a special project file to trigger the vulnerability. This implies that attackers would have to deliver this crafted file to the system running the affected software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the capability to craft a malicious project file.
- The attacker must have a way to get the targeted user to load the malicious project file, making the UI interaction as a requirement for the vulnerability to be exploited.
- The attack vector is considered to be local and requires user interaction. This implies the attacker cannot directly exploit the system remotely.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Fuji Electric Tellus Lite V-Simulator and V-Server Lite versions prior to v4.0.10.0.
- The provided text contains the CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 with the vector string AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
- Multiple vulnerabilities were identified in the same products.
