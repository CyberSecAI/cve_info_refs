- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to the use of a hard-coded password within the charging station web server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-259: Use of Hard-coded Password. This indicates a failure to implement proper credential management, resulting in a static, unchanging password being used for authentication.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized administrative privileges, leading to complete control over the charging station.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N). An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by accessing the web server of the charging station through the network. No user interaction is required (UI:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any prior privileges (PR:N) to exploit the vulnerability, implying the hard-coded password is used as a default and can be attempted by anyone able to reach the charging station's web server.
