Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-22570:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

*   The content from multiple sources (Fedora mailing lists, Oracle advisories, NetApp advisories, and Debian security advisories) explicitly mentions CVE-2021-22570 and its impact on products like protobuf, MySQL, and Chromium. These sources provide information aligning with the CVE description.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability stems from incorrect parsing of a null character (nullchar) within a proto symbol, which leads to a null pointer dereference when generating an error message. The symbol is parsed incorrectly and the program attempts to access a file name via a null pointer. (Fedora, Debian, Oracle)
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   Incorrect parsing of null characters in proto symbols.
    *   Lack of null pointer checks before accessing file names during error generation. (Fedora, Debian)
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A null pointer dereference can cause a program to crash. (Fedora, Debian, Oracle)
    *   Denial-of-service (DoS) is possible by causing repeated crashes.
    *   In a different context, the content shows that `CVE-2021-22570` within MySQL could lead to a  hang or frequently repeatable crash (partial or complete DoS) of MySQL Server. (NetApp).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   By including a null character in a proto symbol or specially crafted input. (Fedora, Debian)
    *   Specifically for MySQL, this vulnerability is reachable through the MySQL Protocol. (NetApp).
    *   In Chromium, a variety of other vulnerabilities are triggered, along with CVE-2021-22570. (Fedora)
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
     *   An attacker needs to control or influence a proto symbol used by a vulnerable protobuf parser.
     *   For MySQL products it means sending crafted requests using the MySQL Protocol.
     *   For Chromium the vector includes a mix of browser functionalities. (Fedora)

**3. Additional Details from the Content:**

*   **Fedora Updates:** Fedora issued security updates for `mingw-protobuf` and `protobuf` packages in Fedora 34 and 35, explicitly mentioning the backport fix for `CVE-2021-22570`. This indicates the vulnerability affects both the core protobuf library and its mingw (Windows) counterpart.
*   **Oracle CPU:** Oracle listed `CVE-2021-22570` as part of their April 2022 Critical Patch Update (CPU), affecting MySQL Server among other products.
*   **NetApp Advisory:** NetApp published an advisory acknowledging that some products use vulnerable versions of MySQL Server, which are vulnerable to `CVE-2021-22570` along with other vulnerabilities.
*   **Debian LTS:** Debian also released a security advisory that mentions the vulnerability leading to a NULL pointer dereference when a null char is present in a proto symbol.
* **Chromium:** The chromium update mentions that this CVE is fixed along with a slew of others in a later release

**Summary**
The content confirms that `CVE-2021-22570` is a vulnerability related to incorrect handling of null characters in protobuf symbols leading to potential null pointer dereferences and crashes. It also shows that the vulnerability was present in multiple software including protobuf library itself, MySQL server, and Chromium. The vulnerability has been addressed by multiple vendors in security updates.
