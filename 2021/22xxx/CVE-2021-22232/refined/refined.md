{
  "CVE-2021-22232": {
    "Description": "A hyperlink injection vulnerability exists in the full name field of user profiles, allowing an attacker to create a malicious link in the breadcrumb navigation of a user's projects.",
    "Root cause": "The application fails to sanitize the 'Full name' field in user profiles, allowing users to inject arbitrary hyperlinks.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper input sanitization",
      "Hyperlink injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can create a malicious clone of the GitLab login page, potentially hijacking user credentials when a victim clicks on the crafted link in the breadcrumb and attempts to login.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "The attacker modifies the 'Full name' field in their user profile to include a malicious hyperlink"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
      "The attacker needs a user account in the GitLab instance",
      "The ability to modify their own user profile's full name field"
    ],
    "Additional details": "The vulnerability occurs specifically in the breadcrumb navigation of user's project pages. The injected hyperlink replaces the user's namespace text and redirects users to an attacker controlled site instead of the user's profile page."
