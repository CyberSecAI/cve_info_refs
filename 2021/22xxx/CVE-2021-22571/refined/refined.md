Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22571:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of an insecure temporary file in the `TransferRunner` component of the `sa360-webquery-bigquery` application. The application was creating temporary files in the system's shared temporary directory, which is accessible by all users on Unix-like systems (and older versions of macOS and Windows).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Temporary File Creation:** The application creates temporary files in a shared directory without setting proper file permissions.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Sensitive data from WebQuery CSV reports could be exposed to other users who have access to the shared temporary directory.
*   **Lack of Control over File Permissions:** The application does not have control over the permissions of the temporary files created by the `com.google.auth.oauth2.UserCredentials` class.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:**  An attacker (another user on the same system) could potentially access the temporary files and obtain sensitive information contained within the WebQuery CSV reports.
*   **No Integrity or Availability Impact:** The vulnerability does not allow for modification of data or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the same system where the vulnerable application is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be a user on the same machine where the vulnerable application is executing.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the system's shared temporary directory.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions `v1.0.2` and earlier of `sa360-webquery-bigquery`.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version `v1.0.3` and higher.
*   A workaround exists to mitigate the issue by setting the `java.io.tmpdir` system environment variable to a directory that is exclusively owned by the executing user.
*   The fix involves allowing the user to provide the folder for temporary storage, instead of using the default shared temporary directory.
*   The issue was tracked as [google/sa360-webquery-bigquery#14](https://github.com/google/sa360-webquery-bigquery/issues/14) on GitHub.
