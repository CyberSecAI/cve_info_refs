    "root_cause": "A user can create an account with a username that, when appended with '.html', matches an existing GitLab page. This results in the user's profile page not loading correctly, and instead, the corresponding GitLab page being displayed.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of usernames",
       "Lack of sanitization of user-supplied data"
    ],
     "impact": "Users can effectively hide their profile page from the public by choosing a username that corresponds to an existing GitLab page when '.html' is appended. This prevents the profile page from loading as expected, instead redirecting the user to the page associated with the chosen username.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "User registration",
        "Profile page access"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "Any user can create an account with a specially crafted username. An attacker needs to register an account and choose a username that, when '.html' is appended, conflicts with an existing URL."
