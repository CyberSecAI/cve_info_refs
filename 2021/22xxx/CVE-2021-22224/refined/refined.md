```
{
  "Root cause": "The GitLab backend does not expect the X-CSRF-Token header when a GraphQL mutation is sent via a GET request, allowing CSRF to be bypassed.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "CSRF vulnerability",
      "Lack of CSRF token verification for GET requests on the GraphQL endpoint"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker can bypass CSRF protection on the GraphQL endpoint and execute mutations, such as creating snippets on a user's account.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is a crafted HTML page that uses a GET request to submit a GraphQL mutation.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to trick a logged-in GitLab user into opening a malicious HTML page."
