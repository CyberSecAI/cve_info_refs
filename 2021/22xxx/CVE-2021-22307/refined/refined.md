- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient protection for certain modules leads to a weak algorithm vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Usage of weak cryptographic algorithms.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local attackers can compromise the integrity of certain modules.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the affected device is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device.
