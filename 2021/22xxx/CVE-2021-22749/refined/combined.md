Schneider Electric Security Notification

 Embedded Web Server for
Modicon X80 BMXNOR0200H RTU Module (V2.0)

8 June 2021 (10 August 2021)

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of a vulnerability in its Modicon X80 BMXNOR0200H RTU product
commonly used in conjunction with the M340 PLC family.

The Modicon X80 BMXNOR0200H product brings Remote Terminal Unit (RTU) functionality to
the Modicon Mx80 PAC platform. The RTU system provides an extensive set of control and
communications features including industry and telemetry standard protocols.

Failure to apply the mitigations provided below may result in information disclosure to an
unauthenticated remote user, which could result in an understanding of the network
architecture. No direct impact on the control process occurs if this vulnerability is exploited.

August 2021 Update: Remediation now available.

Affected Product and Versions

Modicon X80 BMXNOR0200H RTU SV1.70 IR22 and prior

Vulnerability Details

CVE ID:  CVE-2021-22749

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 5.3 | Medium | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

A CWE-200: Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor vulnerability exists that
could cause information leak concerning the current RTU configuration including communication
parameters dedicated to telemetry, when a specially crafted HTTP request is sent to the web
server of the module.

Remediation

V1.70 IR 23 of the Modicon X80 BMXNOR0200H RTU product includes a fix for this
vulnerability and is available for download here:

Schneider Electric Security Notification

If customers choose not to apply the remediation provided above, they should immediately
apply the following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Web access service is disabled by default. Because the Web server is only

necessary for specific maintenance and configuration activities, we advise to disable
the web (HTTP) service when the service is not needed through the Ecostruxure
Control Expert application

•  Set up network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized

access to HTTP port 80/TCP on the controllers

•  When used in an architecture including a BMXNOC module, configure the Access
Control Lists following the recommendation in the Modicon Controllers Platform
Cyber Security Reference Manual.

•  Setup a VPN between the Modicon PLC impacted modules and the engineering

workstation containing EcoStruxure Control Expert.

Additional recommended best practice:

•  Change the default password used to access the device web server. Update

username and password for HTTP access rights with the “Security” link on the Setup
page. See the Modicon X80 BMXNOR0200H RTU Module User Manual.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network for the

devices that it is intended for.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the

most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.
