Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22565

**Root Cause:** Insufficient access control when expiring verification codes.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Insufficient Granularity of Access Control:** The system allowed users or API keys with the permission to expire verification codes to potentially expire codes belonging to other realms. This was due to the system not properly validating if the user/API key had the authorization to expire the specific code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Unauthorized Code Expiration:** An attacker with the ability to expire verification codes could expire codes from other realms if they could guess the UUID of the target code. This could disrupt the intended functionality of the system by rendering valid codes unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Guessing UUIDs:** The attacker would need to guess the 64-bit UUID of a verification code belonging to a realm they don't have access to but have the general permission to expire codes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Permissions to Expire Codes:** The attacker must have user or API key access with the permission to expire verification codes.
*   **Ability to guess UUIDs:**  The attacker needs the capability to guess a valid 64 bit UUID.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to versions of the `exposure-notifications-verification-server` prior to 1.1.2.
*   The issue was addressed in version 1.1.2 and later.
*   Verification codes have a short lifespan, reducing the window of opportunity for exploitation.
*   There are no indications this vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.
* The vulnerability has been classified as Moderate severity.
* The associated CWE is CWE-1220 which is "Insufficient Granularity of Access Control".
