This commit was created on GitHub.com and signed with GitHub’s **verified signature**.

Expired

## Security

* **SECURITY PATCH!** This release fixes an issue where users or API keys with permission to expire verification codes could have expired codes that belonged to another realm if they guessed the UUID.

## Self-report

* Allows HTTP GET request method (in addition to POST) for initiating the user report webview. The API key and nonce must still be passed as HTTP headers (unless dev mode is also enabled). dev mode should NOT be enabled in production to avoid logging the API key query params. ([#2260](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/2260), [@mikehelmick](https://github.com/mikehelmick))

## Operations

* Make Cloud Scheduler timezone configurable in Terraform via `var.cloud_scheduler_timezone` and update the default value to UTC time. ([#2262](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/2262), [@sethvargo](https://github.com/sethvargo))
* Return more detailed responses on code expiration errors. Only return 500 on server-side errors. ([#2264](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/2264), [@sethvargo](https://github.com/sethvargo))

# Insufficient Granularity of Access Control in github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server

## Package

gomod

github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.1.2

## Patched versions

1.1.2

## Description

### Impact

Users or API keys with permission to expire verification codes could have expired codes that belonged to another realm if they guessed the UUID.

### Patches

v1.1.2+

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds, and there are no indications this has been exploited in the wild. Verification codes can only be expired by providing their 64-bit UUID, and verification codes are already valid for a very short period of time (thus the UUID rotates frequently).

### For more information

Contact exposure-notifications-feedback@google.com

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-22565

### Weaknesses

[CWE-1220](/advisories?query=cwe%3A1220)
