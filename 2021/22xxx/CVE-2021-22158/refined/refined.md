Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22158:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server (formerly ObserveIT Server) is vulnerable to XML external entity (XXE) injection in the Web Console.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) Injection: The application is processing XML input in a way that allows for the inclusion of external entities. This can enable an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server or potentially perform other malicious actions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to the following:
    - Confidentiality breach: An attacker can potentially read sensitive files from the server, including system files or application data.
    - Integrity breach: While not explicitly stated, XXE injection can potentially allow for modification of server-side resources, depending on the system configuration and accessible external entity locations.
    - Availability breach: If an attacker can cause the application to crash, this could lead to a denial-of-service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Web Console: The attack vector is through the Web Console of the Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server.
- XML Input: The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious XML with external entity definitions when the application parses this XML data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Admin user privileges: The attacker needs administrative privileges on the Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server's Web Console.
- Knowledge of XML file's encryption key: The attacker needs to know the encryption key used to encrypt the XML file.

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory also includes the CVSS score of 8.3.
- Fixed versions include 7.9.3, 7.10.3, and 7.11.1.
- The advisory also mentions this vulnerability is identified by CVE-2021-22158.
