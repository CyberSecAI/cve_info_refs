- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to an information exposure, where sensitive information is disclosed to unauthorized actors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CWE-200: Information Exposure
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based (AV:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges (PR:H) on the network, with low attack complexity (AC:H). The scope is changed (S:C) which means the vulnerability impacts resources beyond the security scope managed by the security authority.
