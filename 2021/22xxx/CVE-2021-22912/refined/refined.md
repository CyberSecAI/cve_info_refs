{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Nextcloud iOS app, before version 3.4.2, performs searches for share recipients on the lookup server by default instead of only on the local Nextcloud server, which was the user's expectation.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Exposure. The application unintentionally leaks user search queries to a lookup server. This violates the user's expectation that searches would be confined to their local server.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "The primary impact is the unintended disclosure of user search queries to a third-party server, potentially exposing information about the users that they might prefer to keep private.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is the normal usage of the share functionality within the Nextcloud iOS app. Every sharee search performed in the vulnerable version of the app leaks data to the lookup server.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker is the operator of the lookup server and gains access to the search queries sent by vulnerable Nextcloud clients. This does not require any active attack on the user, but passively monitoring traffic of requests to the lookup server."
