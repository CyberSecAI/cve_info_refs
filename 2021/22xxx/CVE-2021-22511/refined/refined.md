- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin unconditionally disables SSL/TLS certificate validation for connections to Service Virtualization servers.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unconditionally disabled SSL/TLS certificate validation
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially perform a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack by intercepting and potentially manipulating communication between the plugin and a Service Virtualization server. This could lead to information disclosure or other security breaches.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks where an attacker intercepts traffic between Jenkins and a Service Virtualization server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept network traffic between the Jenkins server and the Service Virtualization server. They do not need any special access to the Jenkins instance, just the ability to intercept the connection and perform a MitM attack.
