Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22244:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control on vulnerability-related pages and API endpoints in GitLab. Specifically, users with the "Reporter" role or lower were able to access sensitive vulnerability data, which should have been restricted to higher-level roles. The initial fix involved hiding UI elements in the frontend, but the backend was still processing the requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks in the backend. This allowed users with insufficient permissions (Reporter role and below) to access vulnerability information via various routes (web pages, GraphQL API, REST API).
*   **Frontend-only Restriction:** The initial attempt to fix the issue focused on hiding UI elements in the frontend, but failed to address the backend processing of requests which could still be sent by a malicious user. This is a common mistake to fix security issues on the UI only, and not on the backend.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized users could gain access to sensitive vulnerability data, including:
    *   Security Dashboard information (vulnerabilities over time, project security status)
    *   Vulnerability Reports
    *   Vulnerability counts, severities, and grades through the GraphQL API
    *   Vulnerability data exports through the REST API
*   This unauthorized access could potentially expose confidential security information, allowing attackers to better plan exploits and identify weaknesses in systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct access to vulnerable pages:** Users can access the Security Dashboard, Vulnerability Report pages, if they know the URL.
*   **GraphQL API requests:** Users can make GraphQL API requests to access vulnerability counts, severities, and grades.
*   **REST API requests:** Users can make REST API requests to create or download exports of vulnerability data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **GitLab Account:** The attacker needs a GitLab account with a "Reporter" role or lower.
*   **Knowledge of API endpoints/URLs:** The attacker would need to know or discover the URLs or endpoints of the security pages, and REST/GraphQL APIs to access the information.
