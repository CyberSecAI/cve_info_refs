- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper verification of cryptographic signature when processing firmware updates.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The charging station does not properly verify the cryptographic signature of firmware packages. This allows the installation of malicious firmware.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can craft a malicious firmware package and bypass the signature verification mechanism, leading to arbitrary code execution on the charging station. The impact is rated as high, with potential for complete compromise (high confidentiality, integrity, and availability).
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable over the network (AV:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H) to upload a new firmware package, and no user interaction is needed (UI:N) to exploit the vulnerability once the attacker has the required privileges.
