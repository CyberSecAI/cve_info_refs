- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The provided text mentions "SSRF Bypass" but doesn't detail the specific flaw in the code that allows the bypass.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation:** The impact of a successful SSRF attack is not explicitly described here, however, SSRF vulnerabilities typically allow an attacker to make requests to internal resources from the server, potentially leading to information disclosure or other attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is via an SSRF bypass. The specifics of how the bypass is achieved are not provided.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to manipulate the application's input to exploit the SSRF vulnerability.
