- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin does not escape user input in a form validation response.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload and tricks the victim into clicking on it. The malicious script is then reflected from the server back to the victim's browser.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any specific privileges or access rights. They need to be able to construct a malicious link and convince a victim to click on it. User interaction is required.
