Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22875:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `setPerPage` parameter in the `stats.php` file was not properly sanitized when printed within an HTML attribute. This allowed for the injection of arbitrary HTML attributes, specifically `onclick`, by exploiting a lack of escaping.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS (CWE-79) flaw. Malicious code injected through the vulnerable parameter is reflected back to the user in the context of the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject JavaScript code, although the exploit requires the victim to press a specific complex key combination to trigger the injected `onclick` attribute on a hidden form field.
*   **Limited Scope:** The vulnerability is described as having a low impact because the session cookie is not directly accessible or stealable via JavaScript due to the existing escaping mechanisms. Nevertheless, attackers might still be able to perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious URL with the `setPerPage` parameter set to inject JavaScript.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires a user with access to the Revive Adserver interface to click on the malicious URL and then perform a specific key combination to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable parameter and the method to inject the malicious payload.
*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URL:** The attacker must be able to construct the specific URL containing the malicious JavaScript.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker would likely need to employ some form of social engineering to convince a user to click on the crafted URL.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content also includes a fix for this vulnerability in the commit `6f46076a`. It involved casting the value of `setPerPage` to an integer in multiple files.
*   The vulnerability is rated as having a low risk level by the Revive Adserver project.

In summary, CVE-2021-22875 describes a reflected XSS vulnerability in `stats.php` of Revive Adserver, stemming from insufficient sanitization of the `setPerPage` parameter, which could lead to the execution of injected JavaScript code through specific user interaction, but with a limited scope.
