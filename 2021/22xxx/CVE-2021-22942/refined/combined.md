Subject: [CVE-2021-44528] Possible Open Redirect in Host Authorization Middleware

There is a possible open redirect vulnerability in the Host Authorization
middleware in Action Pack. This vulnerability has been assigned the CVE
identifier CVE-2021-44528.

Versions Affected:  >= 6.0.0.
Not affected:       < 6.0.0
Fixed Versions:     6.1.4.2, 6.0.4.2, 7.0.0.rc2

Impact
------
Specially crafted "X-Forwarded-Host" headers in combination with certain
"allowed host" formats can cause the Host Authorization middleware in Action
Pack to redirect users to a malicious website.

Impacted applications will have allowed hosts with a leading dot. For
example,
configuration files that look like this:

```
config.hosts <<  '.EXAMPLE.com'
```

When an allowed host contains a leading dot, a specially crafted Host header
can be used to redirect to a malicious website.

This vulnerability is similar to CVE-2021-22881 and CVE-2021-22942.

Releases
--------
The fixed releases are available at the normal locations.

Patches
-------
To aid users who aren't able to upgrade immediately we have provided
patches for
the two supported release series. They are in git-am format and consist of a
single changeset.

* 6-0-host-authorzation-open-redirect.patch - Patch for 6.0 series
* 6-1-host-authorzation-open-redirect.patch - Patch for 6.1 series
* 7-0-host-authorzation-open-redirect.patch - Patch for 7.0 series

Please note that only the 6.1.Z, 6.0.Z, and 5.2.Z series are supported at
present. Users of earlier unsupported releases are advised to upgrade as
soon
as possible as we cannot guarantee the continued availability of security
fixes for unsupported releases.

Multiple vunerabilities were discovered in rails, the Ruby based server-side
MVC web application framework, which could result in XSS, data disclosure
and open redirect.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2:6.0.3.7+dfsg-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your rails packages.
