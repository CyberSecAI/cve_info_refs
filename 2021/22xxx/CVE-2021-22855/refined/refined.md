- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application accepts any type of object to be deserialized without proper validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can send malicious serialized objects to execute arbitrary commands on the server without privilege.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending malicious serialized objects to a vulnerable function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Ability to send a crafted, malicious serialized object to the vulnerable application.
