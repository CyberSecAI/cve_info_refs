2. Log in as the root user.
3. (Conditional) To automate the patch installation, perform the steps mentioned in [Silent Patch Upgrade on Linux](#t4chu7l2d588), else continue with [Step 4](#b1av0ts7).

If the patch is already installed, the installer exits with a message.

### 3.3 Silent Patch Upgrade on Linux

Perform the following steps to automate the installation of the patch:

1. Go to /opt/novell/nam/patching/bin/ and add the following in the patch file:

   -Dcom.netiq.nam.patching.enableautomation=true

   This updates the patch file as following:

   ```
   /opt/novell/java/bin/java -cp ../lib/*: \
   -Dcom.netiq.nam.patching.enableautomation=true -Djava.util.logging.config.file=logging.properties com.netiq.nam.patching.PatchInstaller $@
   ```
2. Run the following command at /opt/novell/nam/patching/bin/:

   ./patch -i /<path where you extracted the patch>/AM\_4533/AM\_4533-05.patch

### 3.4 Managing the Patch

1. After the patch is installed, go to the following folder:

   /opt/novell/nam/patching/bin
2. Use the following options to manage the Access Manager patch file:

| Option | Description | Command on Linux server |
| -qa | Lists all installed patches. | patch -qa |
| -q | Lists details of an installed patch. | patch âq  Example: patch âq P3-05 |
| -i | Installs a patch. During the installation of a patch, all running services are stopped temporarily. After a patch is installed, all services are restarted and details of the operation are written to log files. | patch âi <location and patch name>  Example: patch âi /opt/novell/nam/Patches/AM\_4533/AM\_4533-05.patch |
| -e | Removes an installed patch. The patch maintains a content relationship among patches. So, if you have installed patch 1 and patch 2, patch 1 cannot be removed without removing patch 2. This is because patch 2 contains details of patch 1 as well.During the patch process, all the running services are stopped temporarily. | patch âe <patch name>  Example: patch âe HF3-05 |
| -qpl | Lists details of a patch that is not installed. If you want to view the changes that are included in the patch file without installing it on your server, use this option | patch âqpl <location and patch name>  Example: patch âqpl /opt/novell/nam/Patches/AM\_4533/ AM\_4533-05.patch |
| -v | Verifies integrity of a patch. | patch âv <location and patch name>  Example: patch âv /opt/novell/nam/Patches/AM\_4533/ AM\_4533-05.patch |
| -t | Verifies if services can be restored by the installer. Use this option to stop/start all services after the installation of patch. | patch ât <location and patch name>  Example: patch ât /opt/novell/nam/Patches/AM\_4533/ AM\_4533-05.patch |
