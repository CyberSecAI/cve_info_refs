- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions (CWE-754) when the affected module receives malformed TriStation packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software does not properly handle malformed TriStation packets, leading to a module reset.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can cause a denial-of-service, resulting in a module reset.
- **Attack vectors**: Malformed TriStation packets sent to the affected module (MP, TCM, or UCM).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send malformed TriStation packets to the affected modules. The write-protect keyswitch of the target system must be in the PROGRAM position, and the attacker must have high privilege to send these malformed packets.
