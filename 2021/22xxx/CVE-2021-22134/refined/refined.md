    "summary": "The provided documents relate to CVE-2021-22134, which is a document disclosure vulnerability in Elasticsearch. The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially disclose the existence of documents and fields they should not be able to view when Document or Field Level Security is used due to improper application of security permissions on get requests against recently updated documents. This affects Elasticsearch versions after 7.6.0 and before 7.11.0. NetApp has published an advisory (NTAP-20210430-0006) that acknowledges the vulnerability in multiple NetApp products that incorporate Elasticsearch. However, the advisory states that none of the products are affected.  The Elastic advisory mentions that the vulnerability is triggered when executing a query against a recently updated document and that an attacker must know the document ID to exploit this vulnerability. The NetApp documents specify that successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by document or field level security permissions not being properly applied to GET requests when querying recently updated documents that have not yet been refreshed in the index.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "A document disclosure flaw was found in Elasticsearch when Document or Field Level Security is used."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information. Specifically, it could result in the search disclosing the existence of documents and fields the attacker should not be able to view.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves sending a GET request to Elasticsearch to retrieve a recently updated document. This requires knowing the document ID.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to know the document ID to send the GET request. They also would need access to the system where the vulnerable Elasticsearch version is deployed.",
     "additional_information": "The vulnerability affects Elasticsearch versions after 7.6.0 and before 7.11.0. There is no known workaround and upgrade to 7.11.0 is required to address this vulnerability. NetApp products that incorporate Elasticsearch may have this vulnerability but are not impacted."
