Based on the provided content, here's the analysis for CVE-2021-22137:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from a failure to properly preserve security permissions during certain cross-cluster search queries in Elasticsearch when Document or Field Level Security is enabled.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Improper security permission handling during cross-cluster search queries.
- Disclosure of document existence despite security restrictions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially gain insight into sensitive indices by discovering documents they should not have access to.
- This can lead to unauthorized disclosure of sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**

- Exploitation occurs through crafted cross-cluster search queries.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to have the ability to execute search queries within the Elasticsearch environment.
- The attacker needs to be a user with limited access (at least at the document level).

**Additional notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Elasticsearch versions prior to 6.8.15 and 7.11.2.
- The NetApp advisory indicates that this issue could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- This is a different vulnerability than CVE-2021-22135, although both are related to Elasticsearch and disclosed in the same timeframe.
