Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-22645:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient UI warning when loading KeyShot project files (.bip). Specifically, the application doesn't adequately warn the user when a ".bip" document attempts to execute a dynamic-link library (.dll) from a remote network share.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient UI Warning of Dangerous Operations (CWE-357):** The application lacks proper warnings when loading a .dll file through a network share, making it easy for a user to unknowingly trigger malicious code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  An attacker can use a specially crafted .bip file to load and execute arbitrary code (a .dll file) on the victim's system, taking advantage of insufficient UI warnings.
- The attacker can execute code in the context of the current process of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious .bip Files:** The primary attack vector involves delivering a malicious .bip file to the victim.
- **Remote Network Share:** The malicious .bip file contains a 'load' command that points to a .dll file on a remote network share.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local access:** The attacker needs to deliver a malicious .bip file to the user, which requires some form of local access (e.g. social engineering).
- **User Interaction:** The victim must open the malicious .bip file with the vulnerable application for the attack to be successful.
- **Network share access:** The attacker needs to have a network share that is accessible to the target in order to serve a malicious DLL.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Luxion KeyShot products (KeyShot, KeyShot Viewer, KeyShot Network Rendering, KeyVR) versions prior to 10.1.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- The vulnerability was reported by rgod, working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
- Siemens Solid Edge is also affected, as it bundles a vulnerable version of KeyShot.
- There are no known public exploits targeting this specific vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
