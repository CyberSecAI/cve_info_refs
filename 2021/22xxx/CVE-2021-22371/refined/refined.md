- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability allows arbitrary capture of call stacks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of call stacks leading to potential unauthorized access or disclosure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may affect service confidentiality, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector but it involves exploiting the call stack capture mechanism.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The document doesn't specify the exact capabilities required, but it implies the attacker would need a way to trigger or access the vulnerable code path where call stacks are captured.
