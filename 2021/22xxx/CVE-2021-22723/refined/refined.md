The provided content is related to CVE-2021-22723.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper input sanitization in the web server of the EVlink charging stations. Specifically, it's a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that is exploitable through Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-79**: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web page.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):**  The vulnerability is made exploitable through CSRF, meaning an attacker can trick a user's browser into performing actions on the charging station's web server without the user's knowledge.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can impersonate a user who manages the charging station.
- An attacker can carry out actions on behalf of the user.
- Potential compromise of the charging station’s settings and accounts
- This could lead to denial of service attacks, unauthorized use of the charging station, service interruptions, failure to send charging data records to the supervision system, and modification or disclosure of the charging station’s configuration.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability through the charging station's web server.
- **CSRF:** The attacker tricks a user into submitting crafted malicious parameters to the web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send crafted malicious parameters to the charging station web server, which could require the charging station to be network-accessible.
- The attacker does not need direct user interaction except to have a logged-in user's browser make a request. This is achieved through CSRF.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity, with a CVSS v3.1 base score of 8.8.
- The vulnerability affects EVlink City, Parking, and Smart Wallbox products.
- The document also details a number of other vulnerabilities found in the charging stations.
