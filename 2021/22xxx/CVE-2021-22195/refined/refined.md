{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The GitLab VSCode extension does not specify the full path to the git.exe executable, causing Windows to search for it in the current directory (the cloned repository).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of explicit path specification for executable",
       "Windows current directory search path for executables"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote code execution on the victim's machine. Attackers can execute arbitrary binaries when a user clones a malicious repository.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious repository containing a git.exe executable",
      "Cloning of the repository via VSCode extension on Windows"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to create a malicious git repository with a renamed executable named git.exe, and convince a user to clone this repository using the vulnerable VSCode extension on Windows."
