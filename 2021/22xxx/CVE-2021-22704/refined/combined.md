Schneider Electric Security Notification

•  Setup network segmentation and implement a firewall to block all unauthorized access

to port TCP/6001 (Not standard FTP port).

•  Use Vijeo Designer, Vijeo Designer Basic, EcoStruxure™ Machine Expert V2.0 software

and Harmony HMIs only on a trusted network.

•  Harden your network and Harmony Product following the best cybersecurity practices

(antivirus, updated operating systems, strong password policies, application white listing
software, etc.) using the Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network for the

devices that it is intended for.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems, and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
