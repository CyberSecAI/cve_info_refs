Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22173:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a memory leak in the USB HID dissector within Wireshark.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- A memory leak is present in the USB HID dissector. This means that the dissector does not properly free allocated memory, leading to an accumulation of memory usage over time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploiting the memory leak can cause Wireshark to consume excessive memory and potentially CPU resources, which can lead to denial of service or performance issues.
- It may be possible to cause Wireshark to consume excessive CPU resources.
- This can occur by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by injecting a malformed USB HID packet onto the network.
- Alternatively, an attacker could provide a malformed packet capture file containing crafted USB HID data for the victim to open in Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to send or provide malformed USB HID data that will trigger the memory leak in the dissector. This could involve network access, or access to a victim's system to provide a crafted file.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Wireshark versions 3.4.0 to 3.4.2.
- The fix is included in version 3.4.3 and later.
- The vulnerability is also addressed in Fedora updates.
- The Wireshark project refers to this vulnerability as "wnpa-sec-2021-01"
