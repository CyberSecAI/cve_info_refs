  "CVE-2021-22118": {
    "RELATED": true,
    "DETAILS": {
      "Root cause": "The vulnerability lies in the way Spring Framework handles multipart requests in WebFlux applications, specifically concerning the creation and handling of temporary storage directories.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "Local privilege escalation",
        "Insecure handling of temporary storage directories"
      ],
      "Impact": "A locally authenticated attacker can perform privilege escalation by manipulating the temporary storage directory. This can lead to disclosure of sensitive information, unauthorized modification of uploaded data, and potential denial-of-service (DoS) attacks through arbitrary file overwrite.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "Local access",
		"Multipart requests"
      ],
      "Required attacker capabilities": [
        "Locally authenticated malicious user",
		"Ability to send crafted multipart requests"
      ],
      "Notes": "This vulnerability affects Spring Framework versions 5.2.x prior to 5.2.15 and 5.3.x prior to 5.3.7 in WebFlux applications. It does not affect Spring MVC applications or those not handling multipart file requests. The NetApp advisory also notes that they are aware of public discussion of this vulnerability."
