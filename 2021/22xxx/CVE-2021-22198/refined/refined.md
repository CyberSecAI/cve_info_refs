Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks when deleting metric images associated with incidents within GitLab.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** GitLab failed to properly verify if a user had the necessary permissions to delete metric images. This allowed any user, even guest users without explicit project membership, to perform deletion actions.
- **Direct API Access:** The vulnerability was exploitable via direct API requests. This allowed bypassing the normal user interface and its associated authorization checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** Attackers could delete metric images associated with incidents, potentially removing valuable data related to incident analysis and resolution.
- **Disruption:** The deletion of metric images could disrupt incident management processes, hindering the ability to understand and resolve issues.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct API Requests:** Attackers crafted a `DELETE` request to the GitLab API endpoint responsible for deleting metric images.
- **Public Projects:** The vulnerability could be exploited on public projects where incident metrics images were visible.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **GitLab User Account:** Any valid GitLab user account, including guest accounts, could exploit this vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** Attackers needed knowledge of the API endpoint for deleting metric images.
- **Project, Issue, and Metric Image IDs:** Attackers needed to know the specific project ID, issue ID, and metric image ID they intended to delete. This could be obtained by viewing the public incident page.
- **CSRF Token:** A valid CSRF token is required in the request.
