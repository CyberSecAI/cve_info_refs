- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw in Kibana's session timeout mechanism where the `xpack.security.session.idleTimeout` setting is not being respected due to background polling activities unintentionally extending authenticated users' sessions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Kibana session timeout bypass. The session timeout setting is not enforced.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated user session can remain active beyond the configured timeout, potentially allowing unauthorized access if the user leaves their session unattended.
- **Attack vectors**: A user with a valid Kibana session that is not properly timed out due to a flaw in the session timeout implementation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have a valid user account that has been authenticated and also have a physical access to the machine where an active session is present.
