EVlink City / Parking / Smart Wallbox Charging Stations

13 July 2021

Overview

Schneider Electric is aware of multiple vulnerabilities in its EVlink City, Parking and Smart
Wallbox products.

The EVlink products are electric vehicle (EV) charging stations for home, private properties,
semi-public car parks and on-street charging.

These vulnerabilities can be exploited by obtaining physical access either to the charging
station’s internal communication port, which requires disassembling the charging station
enclosure, or, in the case of a connected station, to the network of the charging station’s
supervision system. The risk is further elevated when the connected stations are accessible
over the internet and have insufficient network security measures.

Customers should immediately apply the available remediations, failure to do so may risk
potential unauthorized access to the charging station’s web server, which could lead to
tampering and comprise of the charging station’s settings and accounts. Such tampering could
lead to things like denial of service attacks, which could result in unauthorized use of the
charging station, service interruptions, failure to send charging data records to the supervision
system and the modification and disclosure of the charging station’s configuration.

In addition to applying the available remediations, to limit the risk of a connected charging
station being compromised, Schneider Electric recommends that customers follow and apply
network security best practices and ensure that the charging stations are not accessible from
the internet, as outlined in the General Security Recommendations section.

For additional information and support, please contact your Schneider Electric sales or service
representative or Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center.

Recommendations for End of Life Offers

EVlink Parking products with references EVF1 / EVW1 and EVlink City products with references
EVC1S22P3 / EVC1S7P3 or older have reached their end of life and are no longer supported.

Customers should consider replacing the charging station by the latest EVlink Parking and
EVlink City product offering to resolve these issues. Always follow the recommendations
provided in the General Security Recommendations section below in order to harden the
security of the network where the charging station is connected (in case of a supervised station)
and ensure that the station is not reachable from outside this network.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network for the

devices that it is intended for.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the Internet.

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best
Practices document.
