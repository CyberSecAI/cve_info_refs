Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from how the Host Authorization middleware in Action Pack handles allowed hosts. Specifically, strings in `config.hosts` that do not start with a leading dot are converted to regular expressions without proper escaping. This allows specially crafted Host headers to bypass the authorization and redirect users to a malicious website. For instance, adding `"[sub.example.com](http://sub.example.com)"` to allowed hosts permits a request with `Host` header `sub-example.com`.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Improper sanitization of host strings when creating regular expressions.
    *   Lack of proper escaping of user-provided host strings before converting them to regex.
    *   The vulnerability is an open redirect vulnerability.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation results in an open redirect. An attacker can redirect users to a malicious website.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is through specially crafted HTTP `Host` headers.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.
    *   No specific position is required, just the ability to send requests.
