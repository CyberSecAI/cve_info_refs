### 3.2 VULNERABILITY OVERVIEW

#### 3.2.1    [INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

An integer overflow exists in the APIs of the host MCU while trying to connect to a WIFI network may lead to issues such as a denial-of-service condition or code execution.

[CVE-2021-22677](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22677) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.4 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.2    [STACK-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-121](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/121.html)

The affected product is vulnerable to stack-based buffer overflow while processing over-the-air firmware updates from the CDN server, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute code.

[CVE-2021-22673](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22673) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.3    [INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The affected product is vulnerable to integer overflow while parsing malformed over-the-air firmware update files, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute code.

[CVE-2021-22675](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22675) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.2 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.4    [INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

The affected product is vulnerable to an integer overflow while processing HTTP headers, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute code.

[CVE-2021-22679](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22679) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

#### 3.2.5    [INTEGER OVERFLOW OR WRAPAROUND CWE-190](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/190.html)

Multiple integer overflow issues exist while processing long domain names, which may allow an attacker to remotely execute code.

[CVE-2021-22671](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-22671) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

## 4. MITIGATIONS

Texas Instruments recommends users upgrade to the [latest software version](http://www.ti.com/psirt).

exas Instruments also recommends users only connect to trusted Wi-Fi networks.

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure that they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls, and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on us-cert.cisa.gov](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
