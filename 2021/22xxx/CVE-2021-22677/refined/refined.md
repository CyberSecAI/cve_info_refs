This document describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting Texas Instruments SimpleLink products.  CVE-2021-22677 is mentioned, but the main focus of the document is on a different vulnerability. The content for CVE-2021-22677 is:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow in the APIs of the host MCU while trying to connect to a WiFi network.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow.

**Impact of exploitation:** Denial-of-service condition or code execution.

**Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be triggered when a device attempts to connect to a Wi-Fi network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the WiFi connection process. This is categorized as "Local" access, but the document does not specify the exact nature of this access. It is likely that the attacker has to be in a network that the target device is trying to connect to, or perhaps able to manipulate the target device's configuration.
