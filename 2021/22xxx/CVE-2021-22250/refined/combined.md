# Ability to list and delete impersonation tokens for your own user

**[HackerOne report #1205916](https://hackerone.com/reports/1205916)** by `jimeno` on 2021-05-22, assigned to [@dcouture](/dcouture "Dominic Couture"):

[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

##### Summary

GitLab official [documentation](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/README.html#impersonation-tokens) says only and Administrator can create an Impersonation Token. Otherwise users could deny them the use of this feature by continuously [checking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/personal_access_tokens.html#list-personal-access-tokens) their Personal Access Tokens via the API and then [revoking](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/api/personal_access_tokens.html#revoke-a-personal-access-token) the generated impersonation token.

> Impersonation tokens are a type of personal access token. They can be created only by an administrator, and are used to authenticate with the API as a specific user.

**Suggested fix:** only an administrator should be able to revoke an impersonation token. Also, impersonation tokens should not be listable by the impersonated user itself. Also, user won't see the impersonation token when browsing to their list of tokens via the GitLab UI.

**Note:** This report falls under the premise that only administrators should be able to revoke impersonation tokens.

##### Steps to reproduce

This was tested on a GitLab Ultimate instance.

1. As Admin, browse to `/admin/users`, select your unprivileged user and click Impersonation Tokens section.
2. Generate a new token scoped as you wish and note the name you set to it.
3. As user, browse to your profile and create a new Personal Access Token (PAT) scoped to API access at least.
4. As user, list your PATs.

   ```
   $ curl --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: YOUR-PAT" "https://YOUR-INSTANCE/api/v4/personal_access_tokens" -s | jq .
   ```
5. Note the response includes the impersonation token created by the administrator user. Take a note of the token identifier.
6. As user, revoke the impersonation token created by the administrator. Remember to replace the ID (6) with yours.

   ```
   $ curl -X DELETE --header "PRIVATE-TOKEN: YOUR-PAT" "https://YOUR-INSTANCE/api/v4/personal_access_tokens/6"
   ```

##### Impact

Low privileged user is able to revoke impersonation token created by the instance administrator for their account. On the other hand, normal GitLab user is able to know when an administrator has created an impersonation token for their account.

##### Examples

N/A

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Low privileged user is able to revoke impersonation token created by the instance administrator for their account.

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

Only administrator user is able to revoke impersonation tokens. Impersonated user doesn't see the impersonation token when listing their Personal Access Tokens.

##### Relevant logs and/or screenshots

N/A

##### Output of checks

Only tested in GitLab Ultimate.
