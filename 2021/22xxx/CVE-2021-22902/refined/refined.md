- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression engine used by the Mime type parser in Action Dispatch.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A regular expression vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A carefully crafted Accept header can cause the mime type parser in Action Dispatch to become unresponsive due to excessive backtracking in the regular expression engine, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted `Accept` header to a Rails application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be an external user sending HTTP requests to the Rails application.
