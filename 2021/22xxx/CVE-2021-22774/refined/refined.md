Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22774:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a one-way hash without a salt when storing user account credentials.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-759: Use of a One-Way Hash without a Salt:** This is the core weakness. Hashing passwords without a salt makes them susceptible to dictionary attacks and rainbow table lookups.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to User Credentials:** An attacker can potentially gain knowledge of user account credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to the charging station web server and potentially further attacks.
*  **Compromise of the charging station's settings and accounts.**

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the charging station web server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to reach the charging station's web server.
*   **No Special Privileges Required:**  The vulnerability can be exploited without needing prior access.

**Summary:**
The CVE-2021-22774 is caused by the insecure password storage mechanism using a one-way hash without salt. This allows an attacker to use dictionary attacks to get user credentials and gain unauthorized access to the charging station.
