**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2021-22049 and its remediation in the release notes for vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3p and 6.5 Update 3r, as well as VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11. The advisory VMSA-2021-0027 also confirms that this CVE is related to an SSRF vulnerability in vCenter Server and the Cloud Foundation.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   * **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) flaw present in the vSphere Web Client (FLEX/Flash), specifically within the vSAN Web Client (vSAN UI) plugin.
   * **Weakness/Vulnerability:** An SSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to make requests from the vulnerable server to other internal or external services.
   * **Impact:**
      * A malicious actor can exploit this vulnerability to access a URL request outside of the vCenter Server.
      * An attacker can access internal services by abusing this SSRF vulnerability.
      * The impact is rated as "moderate" severity, with potential for information disclosure (confidentiality), modification (integrity), and limited availability impact.
   * **Attack Vectors:**
      * The attacker needs network access to port 443 of the vCenter Server.
      * The attacker exploits the vulnerability by crafting malicious URL requests targeting the vulnerable vSAN Web Client plugin.
   * **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
      * Network access to the vCenter Server on port 443.
      * No authentication is required to exploit the SSRF vulnerability.
      * The attack requires high complexity, indicating difficulty in achieving successful exploitation.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the vSphere Web Client (FLEX/Flash), which is not available in vCenter Server 7.x, thus not affecting that version.
*   VMware has assigned a CVSSv3 base score of 6.5 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L) to this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported by magiczero from SGLAB of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group.
*   The fix is included in vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3p and 6.5 Update 3r, and Cloud Foundation 3.11
*   No workarounds are available, and applying the updates is the only remediation.

In summary, CVE-2021-22049 is an SSRF vulnerability in the vSphere Web Client of vCenter Server versions 6.5 and 6.7 (and consequently in Cloud Foundation), allowing attackers with network access to port 443 to potentially access internal services or external URLs via the vulnerable server. This vulnerability is considered moderately severe and is addressed in the mentioned updates.
