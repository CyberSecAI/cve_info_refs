Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-22191:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Wireshark's handling of URLs within the `proto_tree`. Certain fields displaying URLs were double-clickable, which triggered the `QDesktopServices::openUrl` function, leading to issues with non-HTTP(S) schemes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe URL Handling:** Wireshark was not properly sanitizing or validating URLs before passing them to the system's URL handler. It allowed arbitrary schemes like `file`, `dav`, and `nfs`, not just `http` and `https`.
- **Lack of Scheme Whitelisting:** The application did not implement a whitelist of allowed URL schemes.
- **Automatic Execution:** The `QDesktopServices::openUrl` function directly triggered the default system application associated with the URL scheme, leading to potential automatic execution of files when the URL scheme was related to a file protocol like `file://`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious PCAP(NG) file containing URLs with schemes like `file://`, `dav://`, or `nfs://`, attackers could cause Wireshark to mount remote file shares and execute arbitrary code when a user double-clicks the URL.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The gentoo advisory mentions that the issues could lead to a denial of service, including application crashes, which might stem from crafted packets and incorrect parsing, although it's not explicitly tied to URL handling in the provided content.
- **Mounting Remote Shares:** Exploitation could result in the mounting of remote file shares without explicit user consent or warning.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious PCAP(NG) Files:** Attackers could embed malicious URLs in packet capture files, then trick users into opening them in Wireshark.
- **Live Traffic Injection:** Malformed packets with crafted URLs could be injected onto a network monitored by a vulnerable Wireshark instance, triggering the vulnerability when those packets are inspected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create Malicious PCAP Files:** Attackers need to be able to craft PCAP(NG) files containing URLs with malicious schemes.
- **Network Access or Social Engineering:** Attackers either require access to a network being monitored by the target, or they must socially engineer users to open the malicious PCAP(NG) files, often through email or shared repositories.
- **File Share Hosting:** For schemes like `file://`, `dav://` or `nfs://`, the attacker needs to host files on an accessible network file share or web server.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Wireshark versions 3.4.0 to 3.4.3, and 3.2.0 to 3.2.11, and is fixed in versions 3.4.4 and 3.2.12 and later.
- The issue was reported to the Wireshark security team on 2021-01-19.
- The fix prevents automatic opening of the URL and instead copies it to the clipboard for inspection before opening it using the web browser.

The provided documents also offer more context than the official CVE description:
- They demonstrate the practical attack scenarios, showing how different URL schemes could be used for code execution.
- They give specific examples of affected dissectors (e.g., DHCP option 114, X509 certificate authority info) where malicious URLs could be injected.
- The provided risk discussion emphasizes the double-click action as a trigger for code execution on systems with Java Runtime Environment.
