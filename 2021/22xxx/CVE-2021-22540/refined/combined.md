# XSS vulnerability in dart:html

Moderate

[mit-mit](/mit-mit)
published
GHSA-3rfv-4jvg-9522
Apr 28, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<2.12.2

## Patched versions

2.12.3

## Description

### Impact

The validation logic that exists in dart:html for creating DOM nodes from text (String instances) missed a potential vulnerability when the HTML text contained templates. The validation logic would reset a flag that indicated that the text was sanitized when it came across template tags, enabling XSS attacks to use DOM clobbering for nodes occurring after a template tag.

Affected APIs and more information on how NodeValidator is used to prevent attacks can be found in the previous security advisory: [XSS vulnerability in dart:html](https://github.com/dart-lang/sdk/security/advisories/GHSA-hfq3-v9pv-p627)

All Dart SDK releases including and before 2.12.2 and 2.14.0-2.0.dev are affected.

### Patches

If you're using a stable release of Dart, version 2.12.3 or later contains changes that address this vulnerability.

If you're using a dev release of Dart, version 2.14.0-3.0.dev or later contains these changes.

### Workarounds

Please see the related security advisory above for workarounds if you cannot update the Dart SDK.
