- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions (CWE-754) when processing malformed TriStation packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The affected modules lack proper input validation for TriStation packets, leading to a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, when the write-protect keyswitch is in the "PROGRAM" position, processing malformed packets causes the module to reset.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a module reset, which results in denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending malformed TriStation packets to the affected modules. This requires physical access to the device to put the write-protect keyswitch in the PROGRAM position.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs physical access to the device to manipulate the write-protect keyswitch and the ability to send malformed TriStation packets. They also require knowledge of the TriStation protocol.
