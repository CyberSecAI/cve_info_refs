Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-22946:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how `curl` handles server responses when a TLS upgrade is required (using `--ssl-reqd` or similar options).  Specifically, `curl` could be tricked into continuing operations without TLS if the server returned a crafted, but legitimate-looking, response that bypassed the requirement for a successful TLS handshake.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Bypass of TLS Requirement:** The core weakness is the ability of a malicious server to circumvent the client's explicit instruction to use TLS, thereby forcing communication to continue in cleartext.
*  **Insufficient Validation**: The client doesn't properly validate the server's response, allowing a specially crafted response to bypass the required TLS upgrade.
*   **Cleartext Communication:** The vulnerability leads to sensitive data being potentially transmitted in cleartext over the network, even when the user expected TLS encryption to be in place.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure:** The primary impact is the potential for a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attacker to intercept and read sensitive data transmitted in cleartext. This could include passwords, session cookies, and other confidential information.
*   **Downgrade Attack:** The vulnerability acts as a downgrade attack, forcing `curl` to operate without the intended security measures.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **MITM Attack:** A MITM attacker intercepts the traffic between the `curl` client and the server.
*   **Malicious Server:**  A malicious server crafts a response that bypasses TLS upgrade check.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the client and the server (MITM position) or control a server that the client connects to.
*  **Crafted Server Response:** The attacker must have control over the server that curl connects to, or can inject a crafted response in a MITM position to send to the curl client.

**Additional details from the content:**

*   The vulnerability impacts `curl` versions 7.20.0 up to and including 7.78.0.
*   It affects IMAP, POP3, and FTP servers when `curl` is instructed to require a successful TLS upgrade via command line options like `--ssl-reqd` or `CURLOPT_USE_SSL`.
*   Several of the documents mention that the issue leads to cleartext communication when TLS was required, or that it allows bypassing the TLS requirement.
*  The Netapp advisory describes that the vulnerability could cause "curl silently continue its operations without TLS contrary to the instructions and expectations, exposing possibly sensitive data in clear text over the network."
*   The gentoo advisory lists this vulnerability, along with other CVEs, as impacting all architectures.
*    The debian advisory for DLA-2773-1 describes that crafted answers from a server might force clients to not use TLS on connections though TLS was required and expected.

In summary, CVE-2021-22946 is a critical flaw that allows attackers to downgrade connections from TLS to cleartext when TLS is expected, leading to the potential exposure of sensitive information. This makes a MITM position highly effective.
