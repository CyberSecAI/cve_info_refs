[More about security](https://nextcloud.com/secure/ "More about security")[#### Server owners

For server owners, our documentation has a section with best practices and tips on securing a Nextcloud server.See more](https://docs.nextcloud.com/server/latest/admin_manual/installation/harden_server.html "best practices and tips on securing a Nextcloud server")  [Security advisories](https://github.com/nextcloud/security-advisories/security/advisories "Security advisories") [Official CVE database](https://www.cvedetails.com/vendor/15913/Nextcloud.html "See a full list of historic advisories in the CVE database.")[Threat model](https://nextcloud.com/security/threat-model/ "Threat model")
## Report a security issue

If you have discovered a security issue with Nextcloud, please read our responsible

disclosure guidelines and contact us at [**hackerone.com/nextcloud**](https://hackerone.com/nextcloud).

Your report should include:

#### Product version

#### A vulnerability description

#### Reproduction steps

### What happens next

A member of the security team will confirm the vulnerability, determine its impact, and develop a fix.

The fix will be applied to the master branch, tested, and packaged in the next security release.

The vulnerability will be publicly announced after the release.

Finally, your name will be added to the [hall of fame](https://hackerone.com/nextcloud/thanks) as a thank you from the entire Nextcloud community.

[Read our threat model](https://nextcloud.com/security/threat-model/) to know what is expected behavior.

## PGP Key for Submissions

In order to facilitate secure submission of security issues,

we provide the following [PGP key](https://pgp.mit.edu/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0xD75899B9A724937A) for confidential submission:

#### Key ID

`A724937A`

#### Fingerprint

`2880 6A87 8AE4 23A2 8372 792E D758 99B9 A724 937A`

We do however recommend to not encrypt the information submitted

via HackerOne as only a small subset of the team has access to this key.

Guidelines

## Responsible disclosure guidelines

The Nextcloud community kindly requests that you comply with the following guidelines when researching and reporting security vulnerabilities:

* Only test for vulnerabilities on your own install of Nextcloud Server
* Confirm the vulnerability applies to a supported product version
* Share vulnerabilities in detail only with the security team
* Allow reasonable time for a response from the security team
* Do not publish information related to the vulnerability until Nextcloud has made an announcement to the community

| I only validate those URLs coming from the server or user input. Please go through the rest of **QDesktopServices::openUrl** calls to see why I am not validating those. Non-validate URLs are either hard-coded or point to local files/folders. As [@er-vin](https://github.com/er-vin) suggested, I did the revision of all the **QDesktopServices::openUrl** cases and only validated those risky-ones. |

Avoid global variables in general and global static non-POD types in particular. It is probably fine to have it as a local const in openBrowser, it's not on any hot path really.

Not needed for that one because of the check in the block just before. You are right that this use of "contains" is surprising and "startsWith" would be more appropriate.

There's exactly one call of that function which doesn't pass nullptr for the second parameter. What about adding a commit before this one in your PR to have nullptr as default value for errorWidgetParent?

This way you could spare the nullptr everywhere else in your PR when openBrowser is called.

I'd prefer if we can match a full scheme here. (in case someone has local handlers that start with `http` but may do other things.Unlikely, but you never know.)
