Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The Nextcloud Desktop Client lacked proper validation for URLs received from the server. Specifically, it did not restrict URL schemes to only `http://` or `https://`, allowing for other schemes that could trigger execution of arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Missing URL Validation:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper URL scheme validation. This allows a malicious server to provide URLs with non-standard schemes, which can be interpreted by the operating system to execute local commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit could lead to arbitrary command execution on the client machine, with the privileges of the user running the Nextcloud desktop application.
- **Compromised Client System:** Attackers could use this to gain access to the user's system, install malware, steal data, or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Nextcloud Server:** The primary attack vector involves a malicious or compromised Nextcloud server sending crafted URLs to the client application.
- **User Interaction:** The user would need to connect their Nextcloud client to the malicious server. The client application would then process the malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious Server Control:** An attacker needs control over a Nextcloud server or the ability to compromise a legitimate server.
- **User Connection:** The attacker needs the target user to connect their Nextcloud desktop client to the malicious server.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involved adding validation to ensure only "http://" and "https://" URL schemes are allowed.
- The vulnerability was present in versions prior to 3.1.3 of the Nextcloud Desktop Client.
- The issue was addressed in the pull request #2906 on GitHub.
- The fix was backported to the stable-3.1 branch.
- The vulnerability was reported on Fedora's package-announce list and assigned the bug id 1950119.
- Gentoo assigned it the GLSA id 202105-37.
