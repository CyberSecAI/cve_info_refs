Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an oversight in GitLab's API where the `/releases` endpoint was returning tag names within the `_links.self` field of the JSON response, even when the request was made by a guest user. According to GitLab's permission model, guest users should not have access to repository information like tags.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inconsistent Access Control:** The API endpoint did not properly enforce the intended access controls for guest users. Guest users, who are meant to have limited access, were able to retrieve tag names, which should be restricted to users with higher permissions.
- **Information Disclosure:** The API was inadvertently leaking information (tag names) that should have been considered private to project members.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Guest users could see the tag names of releases, which they should not have access to. This could potentially reveal information about the project's development cycle or specific releases, which may be considered sensitive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **API Access:** An attacker with guest user privileges can exploit this vulnerability by directly querying the GitLab API `/projects/<project_id>/releases` endpoint. They can use a simple GET request with a guest user token.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest User Access:** The attacker needs to be added as a guest user to the GitLab project in question.
- **API Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the GitLab API endpoint for releases and how to use the guest user's API token.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported by `izzsec` on HackerOne.
- The issue was tracked internally within GitLab at  [Security Implementation Issue](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/security/gitlab/-/issues/317).
- The provided JSON snippet clearly shows the presence of the tag name within the `_links.self` field.
- The vulnerability existed on gitlab.com, as mentioned in the examples section.
