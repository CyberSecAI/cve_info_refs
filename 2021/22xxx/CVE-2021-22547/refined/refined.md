```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `__iotc_calloc` function lacked overflow protection, potentially leading to an integer overflow when calculating the size of the memory to allocate.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "An integer overflow in `__iotc_calloc` could lead to allocating a smaller buffer than expected. This can lead to a heap buffer overflow when data is written to the undersized buffer, potentially causing crashes or enabling arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by providing large values for number of elements and element size to `__iotc_calloc` function.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to control the input parameters to the vulnerable `__iotc_calloc` function. This could occur through any mechanism that supplies data used to calculate the allocation size."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Added overflow protection to `__iotc_calloc` calls.",
      "Added unit tests for the function."
  ]
