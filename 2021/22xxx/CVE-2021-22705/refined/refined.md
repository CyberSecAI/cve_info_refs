- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer (CWE-119).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A memory buffer vulnerability exists within a driver installed by Vijeo Designer or EcoStruxure Machine Expert.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to denial of service (DoS) and/or unauthorized access to system information.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by interacting directly with the vulnerable driver.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires local access to the system. The attack complexity is considered high. No special privileges are required and no user interaction is required.
