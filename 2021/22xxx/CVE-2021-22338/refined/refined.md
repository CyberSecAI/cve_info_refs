- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of strict operation on input XML messages by a module. This allows an attacker to inject malicious XML code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XXE Injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exploitation can lead to a denial of service (DoS) of the affected module.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through sending specifically crafted XML messages to the vulnerable module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send specific messages to the affected module.
