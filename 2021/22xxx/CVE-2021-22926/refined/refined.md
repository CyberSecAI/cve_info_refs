{
  "CVE-2021-22926": {
    "Root cause": "When using Secure Transport, libcurl would use a file based cert instead of one referred to by name if the filename exists in a writable directory like /tmp.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper Certificate Validation",
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A malicious user can trick an application into using the wrong client certificate in the TLS connection handshake.",
    "Attack vectors": "A malicious user can create a filename in a directory that is writable by other users, and this filename will have the same name as a certificate that the application wants to use by name.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to create a file in a directory writable by the application"
  }
}
