- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A stack-based buffer overflow occurs when processing project files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code, read/modify information or crash the application
- **Attack vectors**: By crafting a malicious project file that exploits the overflow.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Requires the user to open the crafted project file. Low skill level to exploit
