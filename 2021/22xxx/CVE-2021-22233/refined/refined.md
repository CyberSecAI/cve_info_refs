{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `IdeController.project` method does not check permissions when searching for a project by its full path.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Insufficient authorization checks in the `IdeController` when retrieving project data for the WebIDE.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unauthorized disclosure of information about private projects, including project name, path, description, URLs, and access levels.",
  "Attack vectors": "Sending a GET request to the `/-/ide/project/<full_project_path>` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker must be logged into the GitLab instance and know the full path of a private project."
