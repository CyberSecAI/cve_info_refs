Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22908

**Description:**

-   The vulnerability is a buffer overflow in the Samba component of Pulse Connect Secure (PCS) gateway. Specifically, the `smbclt` application, used for SMB operations, is vulnerable.
-   The vulnerability occurs when a long server name is provided during certain SMB operations, potentially leading to either a stack or heap buffer overflow depending on the server name length.
-   The vulnerable code is triggered through CGI scripts, with `/dana/fb/smb/wnf.cgi` being a confirmed vulnerable endpoint. Other CGI endpoints might also trigger the same vulnerability.

**Root Cause:**

-   The root cause is a lack of proper bounds checking when processing server names in the `smbclt` application, which is based on Samba 4.5.10.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Buffer Overflow:**  The primary weakness is a buffer overflow vulnerability in the `smbclt` application. Input sanitization is not done when handling server names for SMB operations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   Successful exploitation allows an authenticated remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the vulnerable PCS server. This would give the attacker complete control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector involves sending a specially crafted server name to a vulnerable CGI endpoint of the PCS gateway.  The provided Proof-of-Concept uses a long string of "A" characters to trigger the overflow.
-   The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable CGI endpoint, e.g. `/dana/fb/smb/wnf.cgi`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Authentication:** The attacker needs valid PCS user credentials or a `DSID` value from an authenticated user.
-   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable PCS server through the network.
-   **Windows File Access Policy**:  The PCS server needs to have a Windows File Access policy in place that allows connections to arbitrary SMB servers (e.g., a policy that allows `\\*`). Systems that started at version 9.1R2 or earlier have this policy enabled by default.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability can result in a crash of the `smbclt` application. The PCS events log may contain the "Program smbclt recently failed" message (ERR31093). However, this log entry might be absent depending on the specifics of the exploitation.
*   Disabling the "Files, Window[sic]" access feature for user roles does not mitigate the vulnerability.
*   A proof of concept (PoC) script is available at `https://github.com/CERTCC/PoC-Exploits/tree/master/cve-2021-22908` to test for vulnerable systems.
*   A workaround has been provided as an XML file, `Workaround-2105.xml`, which blocks requests to vulnerable URIs such as `/dana/fb/smb`. This is a temporary mitigation until an update is applied.
*   The vendor recommends setting a Windows File Access Policy to deny connections to arbitrary SMB servers to limit the attack surface.

**Solution:**

-   Apply the patch provided in PCS 9.1R11.5
-   Apply the XML workaround by importing `Workaround-2105.xml`
-  Set a Windows File Access Policy to prevent connections to arbitrary SMB servers
