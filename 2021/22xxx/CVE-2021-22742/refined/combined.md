Remediation

Affected Product and  Version   Remediation

Model 3009/3009X Main
Processor module installed in
Tricon or Tricon CX system
versions 11.3.x, 11.4.x, 11.5.x,
or 11.7.x

•  Call Customer Support to schedule maintenance.

Schneider Electric customer engineers will have the
remediated version,  Build 753 – Tricon/Tricon CX
v11.8.0, required to upgrade the module.

•  Module will need to be flashed with new firmware and

then reinstalled in the system.

Schneider Electric Security Notification

TCM Models 4351B, 4352B,
and 4355X, and UCM Model
4610X installed in  Tricon or
Tricon CX system versions
11.3.x, 11.4.x, 11.5.0, or 11.7.0

•  Call Customer Support to schedule maintenance.

Schneider Electric customer engineers will have the
remediated version, Build 638 – Tricon/Tricon CX
v11.5.1/v11.7.1, required to upgrade the module.
•  Module will need to be flashed with new firmware and
then reinstalled in the system. Later Tricon and Tricon
CX system versions already incorporate this remediated
version.

We strongly recommend that you use backups and evaluate the impact of these patches in a
Test and Development environment or in an offline infrastructure prior to installing them in an
online system. Contact Schneider Electric’s Customer Care Center if you need assistance
removing a patch.

If you choose not to apply the remediation provided above, you should immediately apply the
following mitigations to reduce the risk of exploit:

•  Configure the firewall to restrict network access to authorized clients as applicable.

•  Apply hardening guidelines as recommended in the Triconex System Security Reference

Guide (Global Customer Support account required for access).

•  Disconnect TriStation 1131 from the network when not in use.

•  Ensure the write-protect keyswitch is in the RUN or REMOTE state unless the system is

being actively reprogrammed.

•  Operator stations should be configured to display an alarm whenever the keyswitch is in

the “PROGRAM” mode.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following cybersecurity industry best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and

•

isolate them from the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control
and safety systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network for the

devices that it is intended for.

•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB

drives, etc. before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.
•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the

intended network to connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.
•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that

they are not accessible from the internet.

Schneider Electric Security Notification

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks
(VPNs). Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the
most current version available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the
connected devices.

Practices document.
