  "CVE_data": {
    "CVE_ID": "CVE-2021-22924",
    "Description": "libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse, if one of them matches the setup.  Due to errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take 'issuer cert' into account and it compared the involved paths *case insensitively*, which could lead to libcurl reusing wrong connections.  File paths are, or can be, case sensitive on many systems but not all, and can even vary depending on used file systems.  The comparison also did not include the 'issuer cert' which a transfer can set to qualify how to verify the server certificate.",
    "Root_cause": "The libcurl connection matching logic failed to consider 'issuer cert' and used case-insensitive comparison for file paths.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper Certificate Validation",
	    "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Reusing wrong connections could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, or an attacker may be able to perform man-in-the-middle attacks.",
    "Attack_vector": "Network",
    "Attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can potentially intercept and modify data. An attacker may need some knowledge of how libcurl connection pooling works or control of a malicious server."
