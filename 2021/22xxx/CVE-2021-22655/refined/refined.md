Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-22655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds read issue that occurs when the application processes project files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code under the privileges of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to craft a special project file that triggers the out-of-bounds read during processing by the vulnerable application.
- The attack is local, meaning the attacker must have access to the system running the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted project file to the affected application.
- The attacker does not need special privileges.
- The user needs to open the malicious project file (User Interaction is Required).

**Additional Details:**
- The affected products are Fuji Electric Tellus Lite V-Simulator and V-Server Lite versions prior to v4.0.10.0.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8, with the vector string (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) which indicates a local attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, user interaction is required, and impacts confidentiality, integrity and availability.
- The report also mentions other vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-22637, CVE-2021-22653, CVE-2021-22639, and CVE-2021-22641) related to the same software, which are a stack-based buffer overflow, out-of-bounds write, access of uninitialized pointer, and heap-based buffer overflow respectively.
- No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
- The vulnerabilities are not exploitable remotely.
- The suggested mitigation is to update the software to version 4.0.10.0.
