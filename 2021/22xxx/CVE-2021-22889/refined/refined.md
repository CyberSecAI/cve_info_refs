Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22889:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The `statsBreakdown` parameter was not properly escaped in `stats.php` (and potentially other scripts). This allowed an attacker to inject HTML attributes, specifically an `onclick` event, into the HTML output.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79) due to insufficient output sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- An attacker could trick a user with access to the Revive Adserver UI to click a specifically crafted URL. This could lead to the execution of injected JavaScript code.
- The injected Javascript code has limited impact, as session cookies are not accessible or stealable. However, the attacker could potentially perform other actions within the user's session, like modifying data or redirecting the user.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is a crafted URL that includes a malicious payload in the `statsBreakdown` parameter. The victim needs to click on this malicious URL.
- The exploit requires the victim to press a specific, complex combination of keys. This triggers the JavaScript code injected via the `onclick` attribute of a hidden form field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to socially engineer or otherwise convince a user with access to the Revive Adserver UI to click the malicious URL and press a specific combination of keys.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability was discovered by security researcher Alexey Solovyev (solov9ev).
- The vulnerability is a variant of a previously reported and fixed XSS issue.
- The fix is included in version 5.2.0 and later.
- The commit fixing this issue is: `2f868414`. The provided code diff shows the change from `htmlspecialchars(MAX_getStoredValue('statsBreakdown', 'day'));` to `htmlspecialchars(MAX_getStoredValue('statsBreakdown', 'day'), ENT_QUOTES);`, which suggests the issue was the lack of `ENT_QUOTES` flag to handle all types of quotes and prevent attribute injection.
- The CVSSv3.1 score is: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N with a base score of 4.3, indicating a low-severity issue.
