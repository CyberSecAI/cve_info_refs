Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-22895:

**Root Cause:**
The Nextcloud Desktop Client, prior to version 3.1.3, did not properly validate SSL certificates during the "Register with a Provider" flow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CWE-295 (Improper Certificate Validation):** The client failed to verify the SSL certificates of the provider during the registration process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The lack of SSL certificate validation could allow a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacker to intercept communications between the client and the server. This could lead to information disclosure, where sensitive data could be exposed to the attacker, potentially including usernames, passwords, and other private data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker positioned between the client and the server could intercept the communication during the provider registration process.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be in a network position where they can intercept the communication between the Nextcloud Desktop client and the server during the "Register with a Provider" flow.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed in version 3.1.3 of the Nextcloud Desktop Client.
- The fix for this issue was introduced by pull request #2926.
- The Debian Security Advisory DSA-4974-1 also mentions this vulnerability.
