  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `back_url` parameter in release edit URLs is not properly sanitized, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",

    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary JavaScript execution in the victim's browser and/or redirection to an attacker-controlled site.",

    "vulnerability_location": "The vulnerability exists in the handling of the `back_url` parameter in the release edit URLs, specifically, in how the parameter is reflected in the 'Cancel' button's click action.",
    "attack_details": "The `back_url` parameter can be used to inject JavaScript code (`javascript:alert(1)`) which, when the Cancel button is clicked, will attempt to execute. Though the XSS does not execute on gitlab.com due to CSP, this also allows for an open redirect.",
