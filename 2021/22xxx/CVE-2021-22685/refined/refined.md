**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to a path traversal flaw in the Access Controller's minify route, which allows an attacker to use a relative path to access files on the server.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Path Traversal (CWE-22): The application does not properly validate or sanitize user-supplied input for file paths, allowing an attacker to navigate outside of the intended directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could read any file from the Access Controller server.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a specially crafted request using a relative path in the minify route.
