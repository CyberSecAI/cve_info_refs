{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Spring Security OAuth 2.0 Client Web and WebFlux application is susceptible to a denial-of-service attack due to an improper handling of authorization requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability lies in the way the application processes and stores authorization requests using `HttpSessionOAuth2AuthorizationRequestRepository` (Servlet) and `WebSessionOAuth2ServerAuthorizationRequestRepository` (Reactive). Multiple requests can be sent to initiate authorization requests which can exhaust system resources."
    ],
    "impact": "The primary impact of this vulnerability is a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack that can exhaust system resources making the application unavailable to legitimate users. A malicious user can send multiple authorization requests with a single or multiple sessions, resulting in resource exhaustion and service disruption.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "The attack vector involves an attacker sending a large number of Authorization Request initiations to the OAuth 2.0 client application. The attack exploits the handling of `HttpSessionOAuth2AuthorizationRequestRepository` (Servlet) and `WebSessionOAuth2ServerAuthorizationRequestRepository` (Reactive)."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to send multiple HTTP requests to the affected application. The attacker does not need to be authenticated initially, but they may need to maintain session information to send multiple requests or create multiple sessions to send numerous authorization requests."
