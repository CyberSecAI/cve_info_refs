{
  "cveId": "CVE-2021-22222",
  "description": "The DVB-S2-BB dissector in Wireshark could go into an infinite loop. It may be possible to make Wireshark consume excessive CPU resources by injecting a malformed packet onto the wire or by convincing someone to read a malformed packet trace file.",
  "affectedProducts": [
    "Wireshark versions 3.4.0 to 3.4.5",
    "Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance Kit version 8.8",
        "Oracle Solaris 11"
  ],
    "vulnerabilityDetails": {
        "rootCause": "The DVB-S2-BB dissector in Wireshark had an issue in the BBFrame processing loop, specifically the removal of an else statement which was supposed to break out of the loop.",
        "weaknesses": [
            "Infinite loop vulnerability",
            "Improper loop termination"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker could cause a denial of service by injecting a malformed packet, leading to excessive CPU resource consumption in Wireshark.",
        "attackVectors": [
             "Injecting a malformed DVB-S2-BB packet onto the network",
             "Convincing a user to open a malformed packet capture file"
           ],
        "attackerCapabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to inject malformed DVB-S2-BB packets into a network being analyzed by Wireshark, or provide a malformed capture file to a user.",
       "additionalDetails": "The vulnerability is located within the DVB-S2-BB dissector, specifically related to how it handles the BBFrame EIP CRC 32 field. A missing else statement in the code resulted in the infinite loop."
    },
  "patchInformation": [
    "Wireshark version 3.4.6 and later fix this issue.",
      "Oracle ZFS Storage Appliance Kit version 8.8 includes a patch for this vulnerability",
        "Oracle Solaris 11 includes a patch for this vulnerability"
