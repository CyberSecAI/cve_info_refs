The provided content is related to CVE-2021-22887.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability, named "Trickboot," is due to missing BIOS write protections in a subset of Supermicro X10 UP-series motherboards (specifically, those with the "Denlow" chipset).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing BIOS write protections on certain X10 UP-series motherboards (Denlow).
- The BIOS control register is unlocked, allowing modification of the BIOS region.
-  The content states, "Reconnaissance actions allow BIOS to be read/written or removed in later phases of the attack". This means there is a lack of protection against unauthorized access to the BIOS itself.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can read, write, and erase the device's BIOS.
- Malicious code can be installed in the BIOS, which can survive OS reinstalls.
- Potential for installing backdoors or "bricking" the vulnerable machine.

**Attack vectors:**
- The "Trickboot" functionality is part of the TrickBot malware toolset.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Requires the attacker to have access to the system with the ability to run the Trickbot malware. This may indicate that the attacker needs some level of access to the host OS in order to install the malicious software.

**Affected products:**
- The following Supermicro X10 UP-series (H3 Single Socket “Denlow”) motherboards are affected:
  - X10SLH-F
  - X10SLL-F
  - X10SLM-F
  - X10SLL+-F
  - X10SLM+-F
  - X10SLM+-LN4F
  - X10SLA-F
  - X10SL7-F
  - X10SLL-S/-SF

**Mitigation:**
- Supermicro is providing BIOS updates (v3.4) for the affected motherboards.
- For EOL products, BIOS updates are available by request.
- Supermicro also recommends verifying firmware integrity and ensuring BIOS write protections are enabled as best practices.
- Following mitigation recommendations from the Center for Internet Security is also advised.
