{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `AbstractReferenceFilter` generates a link using string interpolation, but the URL can contain double quotes. Additionally, the design model allows arbitrary characters in the filename due to a lack of validation or sanitization during file uploads using a specific `Content-Disposition` header. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML into the `href` attribute of the generated link.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Stored XSS vulnerability",
    "Inadequate input validation and sanitization in filename handling",
    "Unsafe string interpolation in link generation",
    "Missing filename validation on design uploads"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of the victim's browser. This can lead to a variety of malicious actions, such as creating and exfiltrating API tokens, targeting individuals, or specific projects.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker uploads a design with a crafted filename containing a double quote using a specific `Content-Disposition` header to bypass sanitization and inject malicious attributes into a link, which is then triggered by the reference redactor, causing the XSS.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to upload designs to a GitLab project. They must also be able to create issues or comments using the crafted design link with specific data attributes to trigger the vulnerability via `ReferenceRedactor`."
