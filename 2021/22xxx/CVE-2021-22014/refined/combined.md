Product Support Notices

Discontinuation of Trusted Platform Module (TPM) 1.2 in a future major vSphere release: VMware intends in a future major vSphere release to discontinue

support of TPM 1.2 and associated features such as TPM 1.2 with TXT. To get full use of vSphere features, you can use TPM 2.0 instead of TPM 1.2. Support for

TPM 1.2 continues in all vSphere 7.0.x releases, updates, and patches. However, you will not see a deprecation warning for TPM 1.2 during installation or updates

of 7.0.x releases.

Your vCenter Server system must reboot after an update to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2c: After updating your vCenter Server system to version vCenter

Server 7.0 Update 2c from a previous version of vCenter Server 7.0.x, a reboot is required to ensure critical kernel patches are applied. You must manually

restart vCenter Server.

Resolved Issues

The resolved issues are grouped as follows.

Storage Issues

Security Issues

vSAN Issues

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

Auto Deploy Issues

Miscellaneous Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

Guest OS Issues

Virtual Machine Management Issues

Networking Issues

vCenter Server High Availability Issues

Storage Issues

NEW: If you have ESXi hosts of version 6.5.x in a vCenter Server system of version 7.0 Update 2 and later, some vSphere Web Services API calls might not

work on such hosts

Some managed objects in ESXi 6.5.x, such as vim.vslm.vcenter.VStorageObjectManager, define the apiVersion by only 2 digits separated by a single dot, such as <a>.

<b>. However, starting from vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2, for some tasks, such as deleteVStorage_task, the apiVersion must be defined by a minimum of 3 digits.

For example <a>.<b>.<c> or <a>.<b>.<c>.<d>. As a result, when you use the deleteVStorage_task method on an ESXi host of version 6.5.x in a vCenter Server system

of version 7.0 Update 2 and later, it does not complete successfully. If you use a Java client, you see an error such as A specified parameter was not correct:

version.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You cannot register Dell EMC Unity 500 or 600 vSphere API for Storage Awareness (VASA) provider to a vCenter Server system

Attempts to register a Dell EMC Unity 500 or 600 VASA provider to a vCenter Server system from Configure > Security > Storage Providers persistently fail with

an error. In the vSphere Client, you see the message A problem was encountered while provisioning a VMware Certificate Authority (VMCA) signed certificate for

the provider. The issue occurs in both fresh installations and upgraded environments.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server upgrades fail, because in the GUI installer you do not see the option to change the export directory to a larger partition

In stage 2 of the vCenter Server upgrade, you do not see the option to change the export directory to a larger partition from the default. As a result, upgrade of

the vCenter Server fails. In the GUI installer, you see an error such as Insufficient space on the source export partition â/â.

This issue is resolved in this release. The Export directory option is available.

Security Issues

Updates to OpenSSL library

The OpenSSL-1.1.1 library is updated to version 1.1.1k.

The OpenSSL-1.0.2 library is updated to version 1.0.2y.

Update to cURL

cURL is updated to version 7.74.0.

Update to JRE

Oracle (Sun) JRE is updated to version 8.0.291.

Update to the Python libraries

The Python 3.7 library is updated to version 3.7.10.

Update to the Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is updated to version 5.2.13.

Update to the Apache Tomcat server

The Apache Tomcat server is updated to version 8.5.63.

Responses from a remote web server on port 9087 might not have an HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) response header

Responses from a remote web server on port 9087 might lack an HSTS response header and allow unencrypted connections.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Upgrade of Eclipse Jetty

Eclipse Jetty is upgraded to version 9.4.39.

vSAN Issues

You see incorrect scheduled time for resynchronization tasks in a vSAN cluster

In a vSAN cluster, when you navigate to Monitor > vSAN > Resyncing Objects to see the status of ongoing, scheduled or pending resynchronization tasks,

the Scheduled resyncing time might be in the past. The issue occurs only when the Object repair timer value is set to a big number, 36000 minutes and more, as

compared to the default 60 min.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server services might fail due to full log directory

In rare cases, if the vmware-vsan-health-service.log fails to rotate, vCenter Server services might fail when the log directory becomes full.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

You see only CPU, Memory and Hard disks in the Edit Settings dialog box of some virtual machines

When a virtual machine has 6 or more hard disks, the Hard disks section in the Edit Settings dialog box takes most of the screen. As a result, you have the

impression that the Edit Settings dialog box displays only CPU, Memory and Hard disks from the virtual machine settings. All settings are available if you scroll

down in the dialog box.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

You cannot log in to your vCenter Server system after a multi-step upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2

If you perform a multi-step upgrade of your vCenter Server system with an external Platform Services Controller from 5.5 to 6.0 to 6.5 to 6.7 to 7.0 Update 2, the

original trusted roots might be missing from the VMware Endpoint Certificate Store (VECS) and tokens issued by the Security Token Service (STS) appear as

invalid. As a result, you cannot log in to the vCenter Center system after the upgrade. In the vSphere Client, you see a message similar to [500] An error occurred

while fetching identity providers. Try again.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You see an unexpected error message in Update Planner

If the PNID of the management network of your vCenter Server system contains lower and upper case characters, the Update Planner fails to fetch updates and

generate interoperability reports. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as Unexpected error occurred while fetching the updates.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Auto Deploy Issues

Due to a caching issue, ESXi hosts might fail to boot from Auto Deploy after an upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 and later

After you upgrade your system to vCenter Server 7.0 and later, stale cache data might cause Auto Deploy to stop provisioning ESXi hosts. The hosts fail with an

error such as Could not boot: HTTP 5xx Server Error.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Miscellaneous Issues

NEW: You see vCenter Server event reports that Trusted Hosts attestation status is unset on every 5 minutes

In the vSphere Client Events tab, you see reports that Trusted Hosts attestation status is unset on every 5 minutes.

Messages are similar to:

Description: dd/mm/yyyy, hh:mm:ss

Trusted Host attestation status unset.

Type: Information

Target: Event

Type ID: com.vmware.vc.TaHostAttestUnsetEven

This issue is resolved in this release.

A ConfigTarget call delays virtual machine response time

A ConfigTarget call that determines VM configuration choices regarding available ESXi host resources might cause a delay in acquiring disk information from the

host. As a result, you might see a delay in virtual machine response time. For example, opening the Edit Settings of a VM takes unusually long.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix optimizes ConfigTarget VMODL API requests.

You do not see historical data in Performance Charts in the vSphere Client

You see real-time data, but no historical data for the past day, week or month in the Performance Charts in the vSphere Client. The stats data is present in the

vCenter Server database, but not displayed.

This issue is resolved in this release.

The Host view of vCenter Server performance charts displays a no data error

In the vSphere Client, when you navigate to the Host view of vCenter Server performance charts, you see an error such as no performance data is available for

the currently selected metrics in the Memory Usage, Disk (KBps), Disk (Number), and CPU Usage charts. The issue occurs after an upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0

Update 1.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager cluster image scan fails with a VIB relation error when the image contains the Intel-icen Component

If you add the Intel-icen Component to a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image by using a vendor add-on or as a standalone Component, vSphere Lifecycle Manager

might not handle the custom Component properly as a replacement of the icen Component in the base image. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as

Component metadata error or VIB relation error.

In the imageservice.log, you see logs such as:

ERROR Generating effective image failed: Final validation failed with these errors: "["File path of '/usr/lib/vmware/vmkmod/icen' is claimed by multiple non-

overlay VIBs: {'VMW_bootbank_icen_', 'INT_bootbank_icen_'}", "File path of '/usr/share/hwdata/default.pciids.d/icen.ids' is claimed by multiple non-overlay

VIBs: ... .

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2 does not support No Proxy settings

No Proxy configurations of hardware support manager plug-ins or local depot servers do not work on vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Guest OS Issues

You see low-memory warnings for vCenter Server even when the system is not busy

A kernel memory accounting issue might cause vCenter Server to consume more memory than usual, even when the system is not busy. In the vCenter Server

Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) you see a warning such as Appliance is running low on Memory. Add more memory to the machine.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

If host encryption mode does not automatically switch on, all encrypted VMs in the host might be in a locked state

In rare occasions, host encryption mode might not be automatically enabled when vSphere Native Key Provider or a trusted key provider register virtual

machines for encryption. For example, after you complete a test recovery of your system by using the Site Recovery Manager. As a result, all encrypted VMs in

the host might be in a locked state.

This issue is resolved in this release.

After a vCenter Server or ESXi host reboot, all encrypted VMs in the host might be in a locked state

In rare cases, vCenter Server might lose track of virtual machine keys reference records on an ESXi host. As a result, after a restart of the vCenter Server or the

host, all encrypted virtual machines in that host are in a locked state.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that vCenter Server never clears VM key reference records in the vCenter Server database, even if host

encryption fails.

Networking Issues

When you create a distributed port group, you do not see any ESXi hosts in the ESXi hosts list

After you add a distributed port group to a vSphere Distributed Switch, you might not see any ESXi hosts in the ESXi hosts list, although you have hosts

connected to the VDS.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server High Availability Issues

If the Active Directory domain in your vCenter Single Sign-On is an external identity source, vCenter Server High Availability deployment might fail

If the Active Directory domain in your vCenter Single Sign-On is an external identity source, vCenter Server High Availability deployment might fail with an error

that PostgreSQL server is not configured correctly.

This issue is resolved in this release.

VM Component Protection (VMCP) does not respond to All Paths Down (APD) events

If you have VMCP enabled in your vSphere environment, a rare issue with the vSphere High Availability management agent on ESXi hosts, FDM, might prevent

response to APD events. As a result, affected virtual machines do not restart on another host.

In the /var/log/vobd.log file you see messages such as:

2021-03-11T09:49:57.123Z: [APDCorrelator] 460296002450us: [vob.storage.apd.timeout] Device or filesystem with identifier [naa.600601607b477826e60ef95ed62e643f]

has entered the All Paths Down Timeout state after being in the All Paths Down state for 140 seconds. I/Os will now be fast failed.

In the /var/log/fdm.log file, you see messages such as:

2021-03-11T09:49:57.754Z warning fdm[2104475] [Originator@6876 sub=Election opID=SWI-3ab50c2a] IM reprts no locally accessible datastores

This issue is resolved in this release.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

ESXi upgrade from 7.0.x to a later version on a 7.0 vCenter Server system fails

On a vCenter Server system of version 7.0, if you attempt to update ESXi hosts of version 7.0.x to a later version, for example 7.0 Update 1 to 7.0 Update 2a, by

using an vSphere Lifecycle Manager upgrade baseline, the upgrade fails. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as Upgrade is not supported for host.

Workaround: You must first upgrade your vCenter Server to the required 7.0.x version and then upgrade ESXi hosts by using a vSphere Lifecycle Manager

upgrade baseline. Alternatively, use an interactive upgrade from a CD, DVD or USB, a scripted upgrade, or ESXCLI instead of a vSphere Lifecycle Manager

upgrade baseline.

Upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2 by using the GUI installer stops at 50%

Upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 2 by using the GUI installer stops at 50%. In stage 2 of the deployment, you see an error message such as Unable to

authenticate user.

Workaround: Use https://appliance-IP-address-or-FQDN:5480 in a Web browser to complete the installation.

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

When you try to check VMware Tools or VM Hardware compliance status, you see a status 500 error and the check returns no results

In the vSphere Client, when you navigate to the Updates tab of a container object: host, cluster, data center, or vCenter Server instance, to check VMware Tools

or VM Hardware compliance status, you might see a status 500 error. The check works only if you navigate to the Updates tab of a virtual machine.

Workaround: None

vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

You cannot migrate vSphere Cluster Services (vCLS) agent virtual machines and see a no privileges error

vSphere admins might not automatically get Containerized Permissions that protect vCLS VMs. As a result, although you have admin permissions, you might not

be able to migrate vCLS VMs. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as:

You have no privileges to view vCLS (1) object

Workaround: Log out of the vSphere Client and then log in as admin.

Upgrade Notes for This Release

Important: Upgrades and migrations from vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3 to vCenter Server 6.7 Update 3 and above are supported. For more information on vCenter

Server supported upgrade and migration paths, please refer to VMware knowledge base article 67077.

Upgrades or migration of vCenter Server earlier than 5.5 Update 3b when the environment is with an external vCenter Single Sign-On to vCenter Server 6.5 Update

3 with an external Platform Services Controller are unsupported. For example, to upgrade or migrate vCenter Server 5.5 with an external vCenter Single Sign-On to

vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3 with an external Platform Services Controller, you must first update to vCenter Server 5.5 Update 3b and then perform the upgrade or

migration to vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3.

vCenter Server 5.5 Update 3b build numbers are:

vCenter Server 5.5 Update 3b, build 3252642

vCenter Server Appliance 5.5 Update 3b, build 3255668

Upgrades or migration of vCenter Server 5.5 and later with an embedded vCenter Single Sign-On to vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3 with an embedded Platform Services

Controller are supported scenarios.

Miscellaneous Issues

An ESXi host might get disconnected from the vCenter Server system

The vpxa service might fail due to excessive memory usage when iterating on a large directory tree. As a result, an ESXi host might get disconnected from

the vCenter Server system.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Stored procedures for the cleanup of tasks and events in the vCenter Server Appliance might fail

Stored procedures for the cleanup of tasks and events in the vCenter Server Appliance might fail with an error ERROR FOREACH expression must not be null in the

postgresql-XX.logs.

This issue is resolved in this release.

A vCenter Server system might cancel the RPC calls due to a race in the communication between vCenter Server and the ESXi hosts

A vCenter Server system might cancel the RPC calls due to a race in the VM Object Management Infrastructure RPC ping logic. As a result, you might observe

operation failures.

This issue is resolved in this release.

When you try to power on a virtual machine with a full CPU reservation or perform a migration by using vSphere vMotion, the operation might fail

If the ESXi hosts in a cluster have CPU size differences, the power-on operation or migration by using vSphere vMotion of a virtual machine that has a full CPU

reservation might fail. Operations involving virtual machines with full CPU reservations might result in constraint check failures because of the CPU size

differences.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix relaxes the constraint check.

In an environment with a heavy workload, the VMware Security Token Service (vmware-stsd) might stop responding and cause login failures

The vmware-stsd service has a fixed amount of allocated memory in the setenv.sh file but the memory size might be insufficient in an environment with a heavy

workload. As a result, the vmware-stsd service might stop responding and cause login failures.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix dynamically sets the memory allocation for the vmware-stsd service at the start time, based on the size of the

deployment.

A scheduled task to take snapshots of multiple virtual machines might start immediately instead of at the scheduled time

When you schedule a task to take snapshots of multiple virtual machines, the task starts immediately instead of at the scheduled time.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You might be unable to start the vCenter Server services due to an invalid JSON file

The vCenter Server services stat file might become corrupt due to disk I/O issues or a disk full error. When you try to restart the vCenter Server services, the file

is empty and therefore detected as an invalid JSON file. As a result, the vCenter Server services fail to start.

This issue is resolved in this release.

When you enable vSphere Storage Distributed Resource Scheduler (vSphere Storage DRS) and anti-affinity rules, the vpxd service might stop responding

When the vpxd service checks for violation of the DRS affinity rule for a virtual machine, the vpxd service might stop responding due to invalid memory access.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Guest OS Issues

You cannot set a primary virtual NIC

You cannot customize the vCenter Server Appliance guest OS to set a virtual NIC as a primary NIC.

This issue is resolved in this release. With this fix, you can customize a virtual NIC and set it up as a primary NIC if it is the first NIC, has a static IPv4 address, and

a configured gateway.

Installation, Upgrade, Convergence, and Migration Issues

The vCenter Server Convergence Tool might fail to convert an external Platform Services Controller to an embedded Platform Services Controller due to a

command failure

When you upgrade from vCenter Server 6.5 to 6.5 Update 2d, the vmafd_cli command cannot return the LDU entries and fails with a Converge Failed to get ldu

id of localhost error. As a result, the vCenter Server Convergence Tool might fail to convert an external Platform Services Controller to an embedded Platform

Services Controller.

This issue is resolved in this release.

After the convergence of a vCenter Server Appliance with an external Platform Services Controller, the IPv6 loopback address might be replaced by an IPv4

loopback address

If you convert instances of vCenter Server Appliance with an external Platform Services Controller to vCenter Server Appliance with an embedded Platform

Services Controller connected in Embedded Linked Mode, the loopback address [::1] in pure IPv6 setup might be removed from the /etc/resolv.conf file. An

IPv4 loopback address, such as [127.0.0.1], might be added.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Certifications might be lost after a convergence of a vCenter Server instance with an external Platform Services Controller to a vCenter Server instance with

an embedded Platform Services Controller

Key Management Server (KMS) and Certificate Authority (CA) certificates might be lost after a convergence of the vCenter Server instance with an external

Platform Services Controller to a vCenter Server instance with an embedded Platform Services Controller. You might see a warning similar to:

Not connected (Trust not established. View Details)

This issue is resolved in this release.

VMware High Availability and Fault Tolerance Issues

The Fault Domain Manager (FDM) might become unavailable when you migrate a virtual machine by using vSphere vMotion

When the process of migration of a virtual machine by using vSphere vMotion finishes, the virtual machine might not remain in the inventory. As a result, the FDM

might become unavailable when trying to access the virtual machine.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Configuration of VMware vCenter Server High Availability might fail with an error that the PNID host name does not match the IP address

Configuration of vCenter Server High Availability might fail with an error that the PNID host name does not match the IP address.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Security Issues

Update to the Spring Framework

The Spring Framework is updated to version 4.3.22.

Upgrade of Eclipse Jetty

Eclipse Jetty is upgraded to version 9.4.14.v20181114.

Update to PostgreSQL

PostgreSQL is updated to version 9.6.13.

Update to cURL

cURL in the vCenter Server Appliance is updated to version 7.64.

Update of the JSON processor package

The JSON processor package is updated to version 2.9.8.

Numbering of firewall rules might unexpectedly change if you reorder the rules

If you create more than 9 firewall rules in a vCenter Server Appliance and change the order, setting a rule with a double-digit numbering among rules with one-

digit numbering, the numbering might change. For instance, if you move a rule with number 10, such as 10 RETURN all -- X.X.X.10 anywhere, to position 2, the

numbering might change to 2 RETURN all -- X.X.X.10 anywhere.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Users with a Virtual Machine user role might not be able to edit the scheduled tasks that they created

Users with permissions on a folder level, such as Virtual Machine user, might not be able to run, edit, or delete the scheduled tasks that they create.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Update to Apache Struts

Apache Struts is updated to version 2.5.20.

Update to the OpenSSH

The OpenSSH version is updated to version 7.4p1-8.

Update to the Network Time Protocol (NTP) daemon

The NTP daemon is updated to version 4.2.8p12-3.

Security vulnerabilities with jQuery version 2.1.4

The jQuery version 2.1.4 might have security vulnerabilities while performing AJAX calls to Domino agents.

This issue is resolved in this release. This fix upgrades jQuery and the jQuery UI to version 3.3.1.

Update to OpenSSL

The OpenSSL package is updated to version openssl-1.0.2r.

Update to the Apache HTTP Server

The Apache HTTP Server (httpd) is updated to version 2.4.39 to resolve security issues with identifiers CVE-2019-0211, CVE-2019-2017, and CVE-2019-0215.

Update to JRE

Oracle (Sun) JRE is updated to version 1.8.212.

Update to the Python library

The Python third-party library is updated to version 2.7.16/3.5.6.

Update to the Apache Commons BeanUtils package

The Apache Commons BeanUtils package is updated to version 1.9.3.

Update to the Apache Tomcat server

The Apache Tomcat server is updated to version 8.5.40.

After the Active Directory server is temporarily inaccessible, the user and group permissions for the Active Directory domain are removed

vCenter Server regularly validates users and groups against the Windows Active Directory domain. If an identity is removed, the vCenter Server system removes

the permissions associated with it. If the Active Directory server is unreachable during the validation process, the vCenter Server system might incorrectly

interpret this as removal of all domain users and groups and might remove the permissions associated with them.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix differentiates between a missing identity and no connection.

Update to Photon OS kernel

Photon OS kernel is updated to version 4.4.182 to resolve security issues with identifiers CVE-2019-11477, CVE-2019-11478, and CVE-2019-11479.

vMotion Issues

An ESXi host might be displayed as not responding

An ESXi host might be marked as not responding and unmanageable by vCenter Server. As part of the load balancing process, vSphere DRS might trigger

multiple attempts to migrate the same virtual machine by using vSphere vMotion. If the ESXi host loses connectivity to vCenter Server before the migration of the

virtual machine completes, even if the connectivity is recovered for the subsequent migrations of the same virtual machine, the vpxa agent fails to send

heartbeat to the vpxd service. As a result, the vpxd service marks the ESXi host as unresponsive.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Expanding the disk of a virtual machine by using VMware vRealize Automation might fail with an error for insufficient disk space on a datastore

If vSphere Storage DRS does not provide a recommendation while you run an operation to expand the disk of a virtual machine by using VMware vRealize

Automation, the operation might fail, because the current datastore might not have enough space. This happens when Storage DRS picks a wrong matching disk

for the operation. As a result, you might see the error Insufficient disk space on datastore.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You cannot perform a migration by using vSphere vMotion when the virtual machine is configured with a local datastore swap

If a virtual machine is configured to use a local datastore swap and you select the Change compute resource only migration type, the virtual machine cannot find

any compatible resource. As a result, you cannot perform a migration by using vSphere vMotion.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

Windows virtual machines might fail when the OS is reset

Windows virtual machines might fail when the OS is reset. The reset might be a result of internal issues, but the issue might also occur upon a normal manual

reset.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You might not see other hard disks information in the VM Hardware panel of the vSphere Web Client

In the vSphere Web Client, when you click the Summary tab for a selected virtual machine, you might see no other hard disks information in the VM

Hardware panel.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Orphaned snapshot entries in the VPX_TEXT_ARRAY table might increase the size of the vCenter Server database

When you create a snapshot of a virtual machine, multiple entries might be added to the VPX_TEXT_ARRAY table of the vCenter Server database. Deleting the

snapshot might fail to remove these entries causing the increase of the database size. As a result, the vCenter Server system might slow down and stop

responding.

This issue is resolved in this release.

A clone operation that involves addition of multiple disks might intermittently fail with an InvalidDatastorePath error

Operations for cloning virtual machines that involve adding multiple disks might intermittently fail with the following error: VmprovWorkflow:

vim.fault.InvalidDatastorePath.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Metrics from dynamic counters, including guest virtual machine counters, are not populated

Metrics from guest virtual machine counters become available on an ESXi host dynamically when you power on the virtual machine. The vpxa service reports

changes in the ESXi host to the vCenter Server system. However, the vpxa service cannot report availability of new counters on the ESXi host to the vCenter

Server system. As a result, the Performance Manager APIs of the vCenter Server system cannot query the new counters.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix creates a new hostd poller in the vpxa service that queries hostd once in every 5 minutes for any new counters that

are added dynamically on hostd. The host-sync process reports any new counters to the vpxa service.

CIM and API Issues

API queries might time out when there are many objects associated with tags

API calls, such as listAttachedObjects, listAttachedObjectsOnTags, and listAllAttachedObjectsOnTags might take very long to complete and ultimately time out,

when many objects are associated with each tag.

This issue is resolved in this release. With this fix, the tagging APIs make batched AuthZ calls to vmware-vpxd to perform permission checks on all the associated

objects.

Alarms are triggered even after using the option Reset to Green

Alarms might be triggered even after using the option Reset to Green in either the vSphere Web Client or vSphere Client.

This issue is resolved in this release. With this fix, events are sent for only those sensor groups that change state within the 90-second update cycle. vCenter

Server 6.5 Update 3 also adds an advanced option for configuring the synchronization interval.

If you remove an ESXi host that is part of a cluster from the vCenter Server system by using a com.vmware.vcenter.Host.delete REST API, both the host and

the parent cluster are removed

The com.vmware.vcenter.Host.delete REST API removes a standalone ESXi host from the vCenter Server system. However, if an ESXi host is part of a cluster, and

you remove the ESXi host from the vCenter Server system by using the com.vmware.vcenter.Host.delete REST API, the parent cluster is also removed from the

vCenter Server system.

This issue is resolved in this release. If you try to remove an ESXi host that is part of a cluster by using the com.vmware.vcenter.Host.delete REST API, an error such

as ResourceInUse occurs.

Networking Issues

After an API call to an ESXi host, if a transaction element is not removed, the vpxd service might run out of memory

In some cases, after an API call to an ESXi host, if a transaction element is not removed, the vpxd service might run out of memory. This issue occurs in large

deployments with complex traffic filters configured on distributed virtual port groups.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Distributed Switch might become out of sync for some ESXi hosts after the upgrade to vSphere Distributed Switch 6.6

When you migrate a virtual machine that uses a vSAN datastore from an ESXi host in one data center to an ESXi host in another data center, the port on the

source distributed switch might not be released in the vCenter Server system. As a result, the vSphere Distributed Switch might become out of sync when you

upgrade to vSphere Distributed Switch 6.6.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You cannot migrate virtual machines by using vSphere vMotion between ESXi hosts with NSX managed virtual distributed switches (N-VDS) and vSphere

Standard Switches

With vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3, you can migrate virtual machines by using vSphere vMotion between ESXi hosts with N-VDS and vSphere Standard Switches.

To enable the feature, you must upgrade your vSphere system to vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3 and ESXi 6.5 Update 3 on both source and destination sites.

This issue is resolved in this release.

After you revert to a snapshot, the virtual machine NIC might be incorrectly connected to the vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS)

If you take a snapshot of a virtual machine when the VM NIC is disconnected from a VDS, reverting to that same snapshot, might result in the VM NIC getting

connected to the VDS automatically.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) might incorrectly determine that a cluster is imbalanced

vSphere DRS might incorrectly determine that a cluster is severely imbalanced when the number of failover and non-failover hosts is nearly equal. As a result,

DRS frequently triggers vMotion migrations.

This issue is resolved in this release. For the fix to take effect, you must enable the advanced option ExcludeFailoverHostFromSD by setting it to 1. This option

excludes any failover hosts from the calculations performed by DRS to detect if a cluster is balanced or not.

In complex Active Directory environments, you might fail to log in to the vCenter Server system with a NoPermission error

In environments with complex or slow Active Directory deployments, the Active Directory users might fail to log in to the vCenter Server system with a

NoPermission error.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Server Configuration Issues

You cannot restart the vpxd service when the KMS certificate is expired or close to the expiration date

When the KMS certificate is expired or close to the expiration date, you cannot restart the vpxd service and the vCenter Server system upgrade might fail.

This issue is resolved in this release. You must update the KMS certificate before restarting the vpxd service.

Storage Issues

vSphere Storage DRS load balancing of multiple thin provisioned disks might take long and block other processes

If you create multiple thin provisioned disks on a datastore, vSphere Storage DRS might run into an infinite loop while trying to balance loads. As a result, the

load balancing operation might block other vSphere Storage DRS processes and affect the performance.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Storage DRS might perform slowly

Some vSphere Storage DRS tasks, for example providing datastore recommendations, might run slowly. This is due to a timeout in the connection to the

Hardware Management Services manager.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You might fail to upload any type of file to a datastore

When you try to upload a file to a datastore, the operation might fail. You might see a 0% progress for the task in the Recent Tasks pane.

This issue is resolved in this release.

VMware vSphere Storage DRS might not work properly in environments with linked clone virtual machines

In environments with linked clone virtual machines or virtual machines that have snapshots, vSphere Storage DRS might not work properly. vSphere Storage DRS

might make incorrect recommendations, provide no recommendations for migration, or run migrations between two datastores in an infinite loop. When vSphere

Storage DRS migrates a linked clone virtual machine, an incorrect calculation of the disk size might also cause a full copy of the base disk to be created.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Reports for storage usage of virtual machines stop refreshing within a few hours after an ESXi host boots

Reports for storage usage of virtual machines might stop refreshing within a few hours after an ESXi host boots. This issue is due to an underflow error in

calculating the storage refresh duration, resulting in unusually long wait times instead of the intended 105-135 minute window.

This issue is resolved in this release. Upgrading to vCenter Server 6.5 Update 3 fixes the timing and re-enables periodic refreshes of storage usage reports.

Backup and Restore Issues

A virtual machine might stop responding when you take a snapshot

When Changed Block Tracking (CBT) is enabled on a virtual machine, the virtual machine keeps track of changing blocks on its disks and requires more memory

in the Virtual Machine Executable (VMX), compared to a virtual machine with a disabled CBT. However, VMX does not have dedicated memory limits for CBT and

might run out of memory for CBÐ¢. As a result, the virtual machine might stop responding.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Backup jobs might stop responding if the number of Network Block Device (NBD) parallel sessions exceeds 25

Backup jobs might stop responding if the number of NBD parallel sessions exceeds 25, due to a concurrency limit.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Licensing Issues

If your vSphere edition is lower than vSphere Enterprise Plus, and if you enable vSAN encryption, a license inconsistency in the ESXi host might be exposed

When you enable vSAN encryption, the Network File Copy functionality checks whether the VM encryption feature is also available for encrypted virtual

machines. If your license does not have the VM encryption feature enabled, you cannot clone or migrate encrypted virtual machines.

This issue is resolved in this release.

If your vSphere edition is lower than vSphere Enterprise Plus, you cannot synchronize a Content Library or move a host to a cluster

If your vSphere edition is lower than vSphere Enterprise Plus, you cannot synchronize a Content Library or move a host to a cluster. The operations fail with an

exception, such as NotEnoughLicenses.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server, vSphere Web Client, and vSphere Client Issues

User login and logout events might not contain the IP address of the user

If you log in to a vCenter Server system by using either the vSphere Web Client or the vSphere Client, the login event might display 127.0.0.1 instead of the IP

address of the user. In addition, you might not see track of vCenter Single Sign-On configuration changes in the Events view.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix adds a new audit log file in the vCenter Single Sign-On logs. You can also see the new events in the Monitor > Events

view in the vSphere Web Client and the vSphere Client.

When you turn on the pair-wise imbalance check, vSphere DRS might migrate virtual machines even if the cluster seems balanced

In vCenter Server 6.0 Update 3 and later, if the advanced DRS option CheckPairwiseImbalance is turned on, when DRS detects pair-wise imbalance between two

hosts, it continues to do load balancing by migrating virtual machines between the two hosts, even if the cluster seems balanced. A pair-wise imbalance occurs

when any two hosts in the cluster have CPU or memory usage difference bigger than the set threshold, which by default is 20%.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Disk Bay sensors are categorized as Other devices

In the vSphere Client, vSphere Web Client, and VMware Host Client, Disk Bay sensors are categorized as Other devices.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix categorizes the Disk Bay sensors under the Storage category.

vSAN Issues

Hardware Compatibility check for Intel VMD controller reports that SCSI controller is not VMware certified

vSAN health service cannot identify the Intel VMD controller, so it cannot locate the controller in the HCL database. The Hardware Compatibility check reports a

SCSI Controller is VMware Certified warning.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSAN disk balance health check incorrectly reports warning

vSAN disk balance health check might report a warning when the vSAN cluster is balanced.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Tools Issues

Update to OVF Tools

OVF Tools is updated to version 4.3.0 Update 2.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

Auto Deploy Issues

vCenter Server, vSphere Web Client, and vSphere Client Issues

Storage Issues

vSAN Issues

Known Issues from Earlier Releases

Auto Deploy Issues

When you click in the Auto Deploy page on non-English platforms, you might see a warning

When you click in the Auto Deploy page on non-English platforms, you might see a warning similar to:

Managing depots is temporarily unavailable. The Image Builder service is down. Try restarting the service to fix the issue.

Workaround: The services ENABLE AUTO DEPLOY SERVICE and ENABLE IMAGE BUILDER SERVICE are stopped by default. To start them, navigate to Menu >

Auto Deploy > Configure, select ENABLE AUTO DEPLOY SERVICE and ENABLE IMAGE BUILDER SERVICE to start the services, and refresh the page.

vCenter Server, vSphere Web Client, and vSphere Client Issues

The vpxd service might fail to start if certificates in the TRUSTED_ROOTS store exceed 20

When the certificates in the TRUSTED_ROOTS store on the vCenter Server system, which manages the ESXi hosts, pile to more than 20, the vpxd service might fail to

start. The vSphere Web Client and vSphere Client display the following error:

[400] An error occurred while sending an authentication request to the vCenter Single Sign-On server.

Workaround: This issue is resolved in this release. With this fix, the TRUSTED_ROOTS store can support up to 30 certificates in both vCenter Server for Windows and

the vCenter Server Appliance.

Storage Issues

Deployment of a virtual machine in a vSphere DRS-enabled cluster might fail when there is not enough space to accommodate a thick provisioned virtual

machine

When you deploy a virtual machine in a vSphere DRS-enabled cluster, and you enable thin provisioning, the OVA or OVF deployment might fail, even if there is

sufficient space to accommodate the thin provisioned virtual machine. The deployment of a thin provisioned virtual machine succeeds only if enough space is

available to accommodate the thick provisioned virtual machine. This issue occurs when you perform a direct deployment to an ESXi host or cluster and when

the new virtual machine is deployed from a template in Content Library.

Workaround: Provide enough storage space on the target datastore or choose a different datastore that has enough space to accommodate a thick provisioned

virtual machine.

vSAN Issues

vSAN health service fails after patching a vCenter Server Appliance configured with a custom port for HTTP and HTTPS

After patching a vCenter Server Appliance to release 6.5 Update 2 or later, the vSAN health service might fail to start. A message is displayed in the

/var/log/vmware/vsan-health/vmware-vsan-health-service.log, similar to the following:

Failed to log into VC, retrying in 10 seconds

This problem occurs when the configuration file for vSAN health service, /etc/vmware-vsan-health/config.conf, does not handle custom ports correctly during the

patching of the vCenter Server Appliance.

Workaround: Follow the steps in VMware knowledge base article 70731.
