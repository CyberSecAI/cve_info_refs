- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A vulnerability exists in Micro Focus Application Performance Management (APM) that allows for a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Persistent XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An authenticated APM user can inject malicious scripts that will be executed in the browsers of other users, potentially leading to unauthorized access, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated APM user crafts malicious input that is stored by the application. When other users access the stored input, the malicious script is executed in their browsers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be an authenticated user of Micro Focus Application Performance Management (APM) to exploit the vulnerability.
