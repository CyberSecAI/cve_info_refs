- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Race condition
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Race condition vulnerability
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation may lead to authentication bypass.
- **Attack vectors:** Not specified in detail, but assumed to be local as it's a race condition
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to trigger the race condition, and must have a position from which to exploit a local vulnerability on the device.
