- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Nextcloud Deck app, prior to versions 1.2.7 and 1.4.2, performs searches for share recipients on the lookup server by default, instead of only on the local Nextcloud server. This occurs when a user is looking to share a card.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Exposure due to the default behavior of sending share recipient search queries to a lookup server, potentially revealing user information unintentionally. This is a violation of the principle of least privilege and user expectation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: User's search queries for share recipients are leaked to the lookup server, which may not be intended or expected. This could expose user's contact information or the information they are searching for to the lookup server by default.
- **Attack vectors**: A user simply using the share functionality of the Nextcloud Deck app, specifically when searching for share recipients, would trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No specific attacker is required, this is a configuration issue/default behavior of the application itself. The lookup server operator would be the recipient of the leaked search terms.
