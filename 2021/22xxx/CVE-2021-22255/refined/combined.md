# Baserow 1.1: Search, templates, Phone field, and more

April 8, 2021
‚Ä¢
Bram Wiepjes
 ![](https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/blog_images/Baserow_1.1_release_notes_e9b1c5cc-8ce1-4de3-9371-f286f5c4c788.png)

This release brings long-anticipated functionality. It contains the reordering of fields, searching in tables, templates, a phone number field, and lots of other changes. Apart from new features and bug fixes, we‚Äôve also made a huge interface speed improvement. If you work with lots of rows and fields in the grid view, you may have noticed that the interface might feel slow sometimes. The performance has now been improved significantly, and we‚Äôve seen an increase of interface speed up to 20x in some cases!

In this version, [Baserow](/) had the most open-source contributions so far. Thanks to everyone who‚Äôs helped out!

## Search in tables

Based on your feedback in the feature survey last month, we‚Äôve added table searching. Simply click the new search icon in the top right of a table to get started:

![https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/pagedown-uploads/blog\_march\_release\_2021\_search.gif](https://baserow-backend-production20240528124524339000000001.s3.amazonaws.com/pagedown-uploads/blog_march_release_2021_search.gif)

Your table will be filtered as you search, and matching cells will be highlighted in blue. To disable the search filtering and only highlight matching cells, you can toggle the ‚Äúhide not matching rows‚Äù switch. Unlike filters, your search queries are not saved and will reset when you navigate away. Finally, all field types other than ‚ÄúLink to table‚Äù and ‚ÄúBoolean‚Äù fields are searchable.

## Templates

Are you feeling a little lost when starting from scratch with your database? From now on, it‚Äôs possible to find some inspiration by using a template as a starting point in Baserow. Simply click on the ‚Äúcreate new‚Äù link in the left sidebar and select the ‚Äúfrom template‚Äù button. This will open the templates modal. Here you can view all the templates and install them by clicking on the ‚ÄúUse this template‚Äù button. We don‚Äôt have that many templates yet, but more will soon follow. Learn how to create your own template and add it to Baserow by following this [create a template tutorial](/docs/development/create-a-template).

# SSRF in file upload file URL

**The problem**

It was possible to store the response of a request to a service within the private network to a file. This could be done by providing a private URL in the upload user file by private file.

**The fix**

Resolve the IP address of the provided URL and check if it is a private IP address. If so, an error will be raised.

**How to test**

* Try to fetch a URL from a public internet exposed file which should work.
* Try to fetch the a URL of an internal network, for example `http://localhost:8000/test.txt` which should fail.
