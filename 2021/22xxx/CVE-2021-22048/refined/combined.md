#### Issue/Introduction

Symptoms:

* vCenter Server patching to 7.0 U3f (Build 20051473) fails with error message "Exception occured in postInstallHook" in VAMI page.

![](https://api-broadcomcms-software.wolkenservicedesk.com/attachment/get_attachment_content?uniqueFileId=1512715943356)

* Patching VCSA through CLI fails with error "**An error occured while starting sts**"
* Upgrading vCenter Server from 6.x to 7.0 U3f will fail with "**A problem occurred while - Starting VMware Security Token Service**"

![](https://api-broadcomcms-software.wolkenservicedesk.com/attachment/get_attachment_content?uniqueFileId=1512709667665)

* VCSA is joined to Active Directory domain and is currently using, or has used in the past, Integrated Windows Authentication for identity source
* Log file /var/log/vmware/applmgmt/Patchrunner.log will show similar to below entries :

YYYY-MM-DD HH:MM ERROR vmware\_b2b.patching.phases.patcher Patch hook Patch got unhandled exception.
Traceback (most recent call last):

core.Thread-2.38715
core.Thread-2.54064

#### Environment

VMware vCenter Server 7.0.3

#### Cause

This issue is caused due to memory corruption in Secure Token Service (vmware-stsd) when VCSA is joined to Active Directory and is currently using, or has used in the past, Integrated Windows Authentication for identity source.

#### Resolution

This issue is resolved in VMware vCenter Server 7.0 U3g build 20150588, available at [Broadcom Downloads](https://support.broadcom.com/group/ecx/downloads).

**Note:**

* vCenter Server needs to be reverted to a healthy state to apply this patch, applying a patch in already failed state is not feasible.
* [CVE-2021-22048](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0025.html) stands as un-resolved in 7.0 U3g as well, please refer to [VMSA-2021-0025](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0025.html) for more information.

Workaround:
To workaround this issue, the identity source configuration needs to be changed from IWA to "AD over LDAP" or "AD over LDAPs" and remove the VCSA from AD domain.

You may follow the below steps to change the identity source configuration :

* Revert/restore vCenter Server to a healthy state, which was taken before initiating the patch
* Remove the IWA Identity Source configuration
* Remove vCenter Server from the Active Directory domain.

/opt/likewise/bin/domainjoin-cli leave

* Reboot the vCenter Server
* Add the identity source as "AD over LDAP" or "AD over LDAPS"
* Retry the Patching

**Note:**

* This workaround cannot be applied in the Patching failed state, vCenter needs to be reverted to a healthy state, then apply the workaround.
* You may move back to IWA (Integrated Windows Authentication) Identity Source after patching to VMware vCenter Server 7.0 U3g build 20150588
* Detailed steps for each action is available in the documents mentioned in Related Information

#### Issue/Introduction

VMware security advisory [VMSA-2021-0025](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0025.html)  describes CVE-2021-22048. VMware has investigated and determined that the possibility of exploitation can be removed by performing the steps detailed in the Workaround section of this article.

This workaround requires that the SSO identity source configuration is switched from Integrated Windows Authentication (IWA) to one of the options below.
1)  Active Directory over LDAPs authentication
2)  Identity Provider Federation for AD FS (vSphere 7.0 or later)

Active Directory over LDAP authentication **is not** impacted by this vulnerability. However, VMware strongly recommend that customers plan to move to another authentication method, The VMware blog posted [here](https://blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2020/05/vsphere-authentication-active-directory-ldap-event-2889.html)  has more details on this.

Product Support Notices

Starting with vSphere 7.0 Update 3i, when you configure the reverse proxy on the vCenter Server system to enable smart card authentication, you must use port

3128, which is set and opened automatically, but you must be permitted access to the port on the respective vCenter Server. Check your perimeter firewalls to

ensure that access has been granted. Make sure you restart the STS service after you configure the rhttpproxy service.

For more information, see Configure the Reverse Proxy to Request Client Certificates and VMware knowledge base articles 78057 and 90542.

Resolved Issues

The resolved issues are grouped as follows.

Server Configuration Issues

Virtual Machine Management Issues

CIM and API Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

Miscellaneous Issues

Networking Issues

Security Issues

vSAN Issues

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

Server Configuration Issues

Hardware labels for Dynamic DirectPath I/O devices do not persist across ESXi host reboots

Hardware labels assigned to Dynamic DirectPath I/O devices in a vCenter Server system might not persist across reboots of the ESXi hosts. As a result, you must

assign a hardware label after each reboot.

This issue is resolved in this release.

ESXi hosts intermittently become unresponsive to vCenter Server

In rare cases, when the password of a vpxuser is not in sync with the password maintained by the vpxd service or is expired, ESXi hosts might become

unresponsive to vCenter Server.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You might see false vCenter Server alarms for a failed email delivery

If a task for sending emails from vCenter Server times out, you might see a false alarm with a message such as cannot send email to although the email is sent

successfully.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix increases the timeout for the sendmail task.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

VM power on fails admission check at an ESXi host with the error InsufficientMemoryResourcesFault

If some virtual machines in a resource pool have a memory demand exceeding the configured memory reservation of an ESXi host, DRS might pass incorrect

resource pool reservation settings to the host. As a result, the power on of such VMs fails admission check in the ESXi host.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Removing a virtual TPM device during a VM clone operation might cause the task to fail

If you clone a VM with a virtual Trusted Platform Module (vTPM) and add a VirtualDeviceSpec::remove of the vTPM device in CloneSpec.location.deviceChange or

CloneSpec.config.deviceChange, the ESXi host throws an exception such as The virtual machine is configured to require encryption. The removal of the vTPM might

cause the clone operation to fail.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Storage DRS operations with virtual machines fail with an error: The available storage IOPs capacity is not sufficient for the operation

If some VMs in a storage cluster have storage I/O reservations, vSphere Storage DRS might fail to balance the storage cluster and throw an error such as The

available storage IOPs capacity is not sufficient for the operation.

This issue is resolved in this release. The manual workaround is to set the vSphere Storage DRS advanced option EnforceIOReservations to 0.

In the vSphere Client, if you remove a vTPM device from a VM or VM template during a clone operation, cloning might fail

In the vSphere Client, when you clone a VM or a VM template with a vTPM device, if you remove the device for the target VM or template at the hardware

customization step, the clone operation might fail.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You cannot put ESXi hosts with vSphere Cluster Services (vCLS) virtual machines in Maintenance Mode

Even users who are part of the Administrators SSO group might not be able put ESXi hosts with vCLS VMs in Maintenance Mode, because vCenter Server by

default treats vCLS VMs as system VMs and prevents any configuration or operations on the vCLS VMs. For example, if you have vCLS VMs created on a vSAN

datastore, the vCLS VM get vSAN encryption and VMs cannot be put in maintenance mode unless the vCLS admin role has explicit migrate permissions for

encrypted VMs.

This issue is resolved in this release.

An unhandled exception when posting a vCLS health event might cause the vpxd service to fail

An unhandled exception when posting a vCLS health event might cause the vpxd service to fail with an error such as Vmacore::System::SignalTerminateHandler

(info=info@entry=0x0, ctx=ctx@entry=0x0).

This issue is resolved in this release.

CIM and API Issues

A PbmCheckCompliance PBM API call invoked with a public SDK client fails with a deserialization error

For entities provisioned in a vSAN datastore, the PbmCheckCompliance PBM API call invoked with a public SDK client returns VsanComplianceResult type in the result.

VsanComplianceResult is an internal type that is not defined in the public PBM SDK. As a result, the public client does not recognize the type VsanComplianceResult

while deserializing the API result and throws a deserialization error.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

When you use a vSphere Lifecycle Manager baseline based on a rollup bulletin customized with the VMware Image Builder, remediation of ESXi hosts might

fail with an unknown error

In certain cases, when you use a vSphere Lifecycle Manager baseline based on an Image Builder-customized rollup bulletin to remediate ESXi hosts, in the

vSphere Client you might see an error such as VMware vSphere Lifecycle Manager had an unknown error. Check the events and log files for details.. In the

esxupdate.log file on impacted hosts, you see an error such as This upgrade transaction would skip ESXi Base Image VIB(s) VMware_bootbank_esx-ui_,

VMware_locker_tools-light_, which could cause failures post upgrade. . The issue occurs due to a recently added upgrade completeness check in the rollup

upgrade code path to prevent partial upgrades. This check might conflict with some workflows where Image Builder is used to remove some VIBs, such as the

VM Tools (tools-light) VIB.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix allows the removal of the vSphere Client (esx-ui) and VM Tools (tools-light) VIBs for remediations with a vSphere

Lifecycle Manager baseline based on an Image Builder-customized rollup bulletin. However, if you need to remove other VIBs, you must create a customized ISO

in Image Builder and use an upgrade baseline based on that ISO to perform the upgrade.

Miscellaneous Issues

vCenter Server might run out of storage space due to access logs accumulated under /var/log/vmware/vmware-sps

The vmware-sps service might generate access log files that do not automatically clean up. Depending on the usage of the service, such logs might cause

vCenter Server to run out of log storage.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vCenter Server becomes unresponsive because /storage/log and /storage/core volumes fill up

Due to a rare race condition, a vCenter Server might continue attempts to access a session that is already closed. As a result, the /storage/log and /storage/core

volumes fill up and might cause the vCenter Server to become unresponsive.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You do not see the button to add permissions to objects in the vSphere Client until you refresh the screen

In the vSphere Client, when you navigate to Home > Inventory > Permissions, you might not see the button to add a permission until you refresh the screen. In

rare cases, the button is not active after a screen refresh.

This issue is resolved in this release.

In very rare cases, Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI) tasks might fail in result of intermittent vCenter Server unresponsiveness

Rarely, as VM events that potentially lead to a bad state accrue, this could lead to a VM misconfiguration and in very rare cases, to a missing VM layout. As a

result, vCenter Server might become intermittently unresponsive when querying the database for a VM layout that does not exist. In such cases, VDI tasks might

also fail.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Downloading small files over NFC stops or fails intermittently

If your vSphere system is busy with multiple calls to connect to ESX hosts to download files from datastores by using NFC, many attempts to retry a delayed or

failed call might accumulate unnecessary load of datastore refresh operations. As a result, NFC performance aggravates and downloading small files might stop

or fail intermittently.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix reduces unnecessary load of datastore refresh operations.

vSphere vMotion operations across Resource Pools might fail with insufficient resource error

vSphere vMotion operations across Resource Pools might fail with insufficient resource error. The issue affects mostly VMware Cloud Director.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Networking Issues

GET VM REST API fails with an internal server error

When you use a REST API function such as /rest/vcenter/vm/{vm-id}, the call might fail with an error message such as Internal server error: Error: Http error

500 while requesting '/rest/vcenter/vm/vm-xx’.

The issue occurs because the networkBootProtocol value might not persist in the vCenter Server database after reconfiguring the VM. As a result, when vCenter

Server restarts, the networkBootProtocol value is not available and the function /rest/vcenter/vm/{vm-id} fails.

The issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that the fixed now and the networkBootProtocol value persists in the vCenter Server database after a VM

reconfigure and vCenter Server restart.

In vSphere environments with Cisco Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) installed, the vpxd service might become unresponsive

In vSphere environments with ACI installed, the vpxd service might not properly handle ESXi host local ports and become unresponsive. In the vpxd.log, you see

errors such as: ODBC error: (22003) - ERROR: numeric field overflow;.

This issue is resolved in this release.

VM clone fails with an error and newly created dvPort remains in vCenter Server database

If a virtual machine clone spec has the guestinfo.resync.mac.addr key in the extraConfig elements, such as the following:

<ovf:Info>Virtual hardware requirements</ovf:Info><vmw:ExtraConfig vmw:key="guestinfo.resync.mac.addr"/>, a cloning operation might fail, because in some cases, a

value for the key might not pass and remain unset. In the vpxd logs, you see with an error such as vmodl.fault.InvalidArgument and error messages like such as A

specified parameter was not correct: config.extraConfig["guestinfo.resync.mac.addr. As a result, the newly created dvPort for the failed clone remains unused in

the vCenter Server database.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure to remove unused dvPort from the vCenter Server database. If the error persists, you must remove

the guestinfo.resync.mac.addr key in the extraConfig elements or set a valid MAC address as value.

A link aggregation group (LAG) might intermittently go down and up when a vSphere Distributed Switch uplink removal

After a removal of a free VDS uplink, a LAG might go down and up in a short time. As a result, virtual machines that use that LAG as uplink might lose network

connectivity.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You might see delayed response from vCenter Server due to insufficient HTTP2 write buffer

In busy environments, vCenter Server might delay response to tasks due to insufficient HTTP2 write buffer.

This issue is resolved in this release.

The rhttpproxy service occasionally fails with a coredump reporting a buffer overflow

When the rhttpproxy service performs multiple operations on incoming URIs, it might miscalculate the buffer offset of each connection, which potentially leads to

errors such as buffer overflows and negative reads. As a result, the service fails.

This issue is resolved in this release.

If applications in your vSphere environment produce HTTP headers larger than 60 KiB, vCenter Server tasks might fail

In rare cases, HTTP headers from applications in your vSphere environment might exceed the limit of 60 KiB. As a result, vCenter Server tasks such as editing

vSphere DRS settings might fail with an error similar to: Error Loading Data - An error occurred while trying to load data. This could be due to temporary outage.

You can retry the operation by clicking retry button.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix extends the max configurable limit for HTTP headers to 96 KiB. You can add the following parameter to your

config.xml file: <maxRequestHeadersKb>96</maxRequestHeadersKb>

In pure IPv6 environments vCenter Server might experience intermittent network connectivity issues

vCenter Server might experience intermittent network connectivity issues in a pure IPv6 environment due to reaching the internal retry limit when attempting to

connect to a system service listening only on IPv6.

This issue is resolved in this release.

See the PhotonOS release notes for open source changes.

vSAN Issues

You see a black screen during network setting configuration of a vSAN cluster

In the Virtual Appliance Management Interface, when you edit the settings of a selected network adaptor, the Edit settings screen might appear black. A similar

issue occurs in the vSphere Client when you try to edit the settings of a distributed switch in the Advanced Options screen under the Cluster Quickstart

configuration wizard.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You see vSAN health warnings such as Unable to fetch key provider details on host.{causeMessage}

If your system has vSAN encryption with a vSphere Native Key Provider, you might see vSAN health warnings such as Unable to fetch key provider details on

host.{causeMessage}, because the data-at-rest encryption alarm might use an old API.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

You cannot install an extension VIB of version earlier than the vCenter Server version by using a vSphere Lifecycle Manager workflow

If you upload an extension VIB of version earlier than the vCenter Server version, for example 7.0 to 7.0 Update 2, in the vSphere Lifecycle Manager depot, the

VIB appears as non-compliant during a pre-upgrade scan, as expected. However, if the vSphere Lifecycle Manager restarts for some reason before you install

the VIB, it displays as compliant. As a result, when you run an upgrade, the VIB is not installed.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

vSphere Client Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

vSphere Client Issues

You cannot export lists of Inventory objects after upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3i

 After upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3i, in the vSphere Client, when you try to export a file with a list of Inventory objects, such as VMs, Hosts, and

Datastores, the task fails with an error Export Data Failure.

## Resolved Issues

## Security Issues

**After upgrade to vCenter Server 8.0, synchronization of password-protected subscribed content libraries might fail**After upgrade to vCenter Server 8.0, synchronization of password-protected subscribed content libraries might fail due to missing security key details. In the logs, you see an error such as: javax.crypto.BadPaddingException: Error finalising cipher data: pad block corrupted.This issue is resolved in this release.
## Networking Issues

**LoadBalancers and Guest Clusters are not created when two SE Groups exist on NSX-ALB**If a second SE Group is added to NSX-ALB with or without SEs or virtual services assigned to it, the creation of new supervisor or guest clusters fails, and existing supervisor clusters cannot be upgraded. The virtual service creation on NSX-ALB controller fails with the following error:get() returned more than one ServiceEngineGroup – it returned 2As a result, new load balancers are unusable and you cannot create new workload clusters successfully.For more information, see the VMware Knowledge Base article [90386.](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90386)This issue is resolved in this release.
## Known Issues

## Installation and Upgrade Issues

**vCenter Server update fails with error for failed load of repository manifest data**If you set up a custom repository that has authentication and self-signed certificates that vCenter Server does not trust, updates and upgrades to vCenter Server 8.0 and later might fail. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as Failed to load the repository manifest data for the configured upgrade after the upgrade precheck completes.Workaround: See VMware knowledge base article [90259](http://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90259).
## Miscellaneous Issues

**You cannot revert configuration changes for the vmware-rbd-watchdog service**When you use the TLS Configuration utility to revert configuration changes, the vmware-rbd-watchdog service does not restore back to the expected TLS protocols.Workaround: Use the argument -s <service-name> to individually call the rbd service, for example: root@sc1-10-168-175-98 [ /usr/lib/vmware-TlsReconfigurator/VcTlsReconfigurator ]# ./reconfigureVc restore -d /tmp/20221124T100959 -s vmware-rbd-watchdog
## Known Issues from Previous Releases

## Installation, Upgrade, and Migration Issues

**If you apply a host profile using a software FCoE configuration to an ESXi 8.0 host, the operation fails with a validation error**Starting from vSphere 7.0, software FCoE is deprecated, and in vSphere 8.0 software FCoE profiles are not supported. If you try to apply a host profile from an earlier version to an ESXi 8.0 host, for example to edit the host customization, the operation fails. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as Host Customizations validation error.Workaround: Disable the Software FCoE Configuration subprofile in the host profile.**You cannot use ESXi hosts of version 8.0 as a reference host for existing host profiles of earlier ESXi versions**Validation of existing host profiles for ESXi versions 7.x, 6.7.x and 6.5.x fails when only an 8.0 reference host is available in the inventory.Workaround: Make sure you have a reference host of the respective version in the inventory. For example, use an ESXi 7.0 Update 2 reference host to update or edit an ESXi 7.0 Update 2 host profile.**VMNICs might be down after an upgrade to ESXi 8.0**If the peer physical switch of a VMNIC does not support Media Auto Detect, or Media Auto Detect is disabled, and the VMNIC link is set down and then up, the link remains down after upgrade to or installation of ESXi 8.0.Workaround: Use either of these 2 options:

- Enable the option media-auto-detect in the BIOS settings by navigating to System Setup Main Menu, usually by pressing **F2** or opening a virtual console, and then **Device Settings** > *<specific broadcom NIC>* > **Device Configuration Menu** > **Media Auto Detect**. Reboot the host.
- Alternatively, use an ESXCLI command similar to: esxcli network nic set -S <your speed> -D full -n <your nic>. With this option, you also set a fixed speed to the link, and it does not require a reboot.
**If a vCenter Server Security Token Service (STS) refresh happens during upgrade to ESXi 8.0, the upgrade might fail**In vSphere 8.0, vCenter Single Sign-On automatically renews a VMCA-generated STS signing certificate. The auto-renewal occurs before the STS signing certificate expires and before triggering the 90-day expiration alarm. However, in long-running upgrade or remediation tasks by using a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image on multiple ESXi hosts in a cluster, vSphere Lifecycle Manager might create a cache of STS certificates internally. In very rare cases, if an STS certificates refresh task starts in parallel with the long-running upgrade or remediation task, the upgrade task might fail as the STS certificates in the internal cache might be different from the refreshed certificates. After the upgrade task fails, some ESXi hosts might remain in maintenance mode.Workaround: Manually exit any ESXi hosts in maintenance mode and retry the upgrade or remediation. Refreshing or importing and replacing the STS signing certificates happens automatically and does not require a vCenter Server restart, to avoid downtime.**After upgrade to ESXi 8.0, you might lose some nmlx5\_core driver module settings due to obsolete parameters**Some module parameters for the nmlx5\_core driver, such as device\_rss, drss and rss, are deprecated in ESXi 8.0 and any custom values, different from the default values, are not kept after an upgrade to ESXi 8.0.Workaround: Replace the values of the device\_rss, drss and rss parameters as follows:

* device\_rss: Use the DRSS parameter.
* drss: Use the DRSS parameter.
* rss: Use the RSS parameter.
**Second stage of vCenter Server restore procedure freezes at 90%**When you use the vCenter Server GUI installer or the vCenter Server Appliance Management Interface (VAMI) to restore a vCenter from a file-based backup, the restore workflow might freeze at 90% with an error 401 Unable to authenticate user, even though the task completes successfully in the backend. The issue occurs if the deployed machine has a different time than the NTP server, which requires a time sync. As a result of the time sync, clock skew might fail the running session of the GUI or VAMI.Workaround: If you use the GUI installer, you can get the restore status by using the restore.job.get command from the appliancesh shell. If you use VAMI, refresh your browser.
## Miscellaneous Issues

**In the vSphere API Explorer, VMware Datacenter CLI (DCLI) and PowerCLI, you see an API option "contentinternal" that is not functional**You see an API option **contentinternal** in the metadata of either the vSphere API Explorer, DCLI and PowerCLI. For example, when you open https://<your vCenter IP>/ui/app/devcenter/api-explorer, you see the option in the **select API** drop-down menu. This option is not functional.Workaround: Ignore the **contentinternal** API option and do not use it.**If a PCI passthrough is active on a DPU during the shutdown or restart of an ESXi host, the host fails with a purple diagnostic screen** If an active virtual machine has a PCI passthrough to a DPU at the time of shutdown or reboot of an ESXi host, the host fails with a purple diagnostic screen. The issue is specific for systems with DPUs and only in case of VMs that use PCI passthrough to the DPU.Workaround: Before shutdown or reboot of an ESXi host, make sure the host is in maintenance mode, or that no VMs that use PCI passthrough to a DPU are running. If you use auto start options for a virtual machine, the Autostart manager stops such VMs before shutdown or reboot of a host.**In a vCenter Server system with DPUs, if IPv6 is disabled, you cannot manage DPUs**Although the vSphere Client allows the operation, if you disable IPv6 on an ESXi host with DPUs, you cannot use the DPUs, because the internal communication between the host and the devices depends on IPv6. The issue affects only ESXi hosts with DPUs.Workaround: Make sure IPv6 is enabled on ESXi hosts with DPUs.**You might see 10 min delay in rebooting an ESXi host on HPE server with pre-installed Pensando DPU**In rare cases, HPE servers with pre-installed Pensando DPU might take more than 10 minutes to reboot in case of a failure of the DPU. As a result, ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen and the default wait time is 10 minutes.Workaround: None.**If you have an USB interface enabled in a remote management application that you use to install ESXi 8.0, you see an additional standard switch vSwitchBMC with uplink vusb0**Starting with vSphere 8.0, in both Integrated Dell Remote Access Controller (iDRAC) and HP Integrated Lights Out (ILO), when you have an USB interface enabled, vUSB or vNIC respectively, an additional standard switch vSwitchBMC with uplink vusb0 gets created on the ESXi host. This is expected, in view of the introduction of data processing units (DPUs) on some servers but might cause the VMware Cloud Foundation Bring-Up process to fail.Workaround: Before vSphere 8.0 installation, disable the USB interface in the remote management application that you use by following vendor documentation.After vSphere 8.0 installation, use the ESXCLI command esxcfg-advcfg -s 0 /Net/BMCNetworkEnable to prevent the creation of a virtual switch vSwitchBMC and associated portgroups on the next reboot of host.See this script as an example:~# esxcfg-advcfg -s 0 /Net/BMCNetworkEnableThe value of BMCNetworkEnable is 0 and the service is disabled.~# rebootOn host reboot, no virtual switch, PortGroup and VMKNIC are created in the host related to remote management application network.**If an NVIDIA BlueField DPU is in hardware offload mode disabled, virtual machines with configured SR-IOV virtual function cannot power on**NVIDIA BlueField DPUs must be in hardware offload mode enabled to allow virtual machines with configured SR-IOV virtual function to power on and operate.Workaround: Always use the default hardware offload mode enabled for NVIDIA BlueField DPUs when you have VMs with configured SR-IOV virtual function connected to a virtual switch.**Some ionic\_en driver uplinks might work with just a single receive queue and you see slower performance in native mode**Pensando Distributed Services Platform (DSC) adapters have 2 high speed ethernet controllers (for example vmnic6 and vmnic7) and one management controller (for example vmnic8)::~] esxcfg-nics -lvmnic6 0000:39:00.0 ionic\_en\_unstable Up 25000Mbps Full 00:ae:cd:09:c9:48 1500 Pensando Systems DSC-25 10/25G 2-port 4G RAM 8G eMMC G1 Services Card, Ethernet Controllervmnic7 0000:3a:00.0 ionic\_en\_unstable Up 25000Mbps Full 00:ae:cd:09:c9:49 1500 Pensando Systems DSC-25 10/25G 2-port 4G RAM 8G eMMC G1 Services Card, Ethernet Controller:~] esxcfg-nics -lSvmnic8 0000:3b:00.0 ionic\_en\_unstable Up 1000Mbps Full 00:ae:cd:09:c9:4a 1500 Pensando Systems DSC-25 10/25G 2-port 4G RAM 8G eMMC G1 Services Card, Management ControllerThe high-speed ethernet controllers vmnic6 and vmnic7 register first and operate with RSS set to 16 receive queues.:~] localcli --plugin-dir /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/int networkinternal nic privstats get -n vmnic6…Num of RSS-Q=16, ntxq\_descs=2048, nrxq\_descs=1024, log\_level=3, vlan\_tx\_insert=1, vlan\_rx\_strip=1, geneve\_offload=1 }However, in rare cases, if the management controller vmnic8 registers first with the vSphere Distributed Switch, the high-speed ethernet controllers vmnic6 or vmnic7 uplink might end up operating with RSS set to 1 receive queue.:~] localcli --plugin-dir /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/int networkinternal nic privstats get -n vmnic6…Num of RSS-Q=1, ntxq\_descs=2048, nrxq\_descs=1024, log\_level=3, vlan\_tx\_insert=1, vlan\_rx\_strip=1, geneve\_offload=1 }As a result, you might see slower performance in native mode.Workaround: Reload the ionic\_en driver on ESXi by using the following commands::~] esxcfg-module -u ionic\_en:~] esxcfg-module ionic\_en:~] localcli --plugin-dir /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/int/ deviceInternal bind.**In the Virtual Appliance Management Interface (VAMI), you see a warning message during the pre-upgrade stage**Moving vSphere plug-ins to a remote plug-in architecture, vSphere 8.0 deprecates support for local plug-ins. If your 8.0 vSphere environment has local plug-ins, some breaking changes for such plug-ins might cause the pre-upgrade check by using VAMI to fail.In the Pre-Update Check Results screen, you see an error such as:Warning message: The compatibility of plug-in package(s) %s with the new vCenter Server version cannot be validated. They may not function properly after vCenter Server upgrade.Resolution: Please contact the plug-in vendor and make sure the package is compatible with the new vCenter Server version.Workaround: Refer to the [VMware Compatibility Guide](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/search.php) and [VMware Product Interoperability Matrix](http://partnerweb.vmware.com/comp_guide2/sim/interop_matrix.php) or contact the plug-in vendors for recommendations to make sure local plug-ins in your environment are compatible with vCenter Server 8.0 before you continue with the upgrade. For more information, see the blog [Deprecating the Local Plugins :- The Next Step in vSphere Client Extensibility Evolution](https://core.vmware.com/blog/deprecating-local-plugins-next-step-vsphere-client-extensibility-evolution) and VMware knowledge base article [87880](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87880).**You cannot remove a PCI passthrough device assigned to a virtual Non-Uniform Memory Access (NUMA) node from a virtual machine with CPU Hot Add enabled**Although by default when you enable CPU Hot Add to allow the addition of vCPUs to a running virtual machine, virtual NUMA topology is deactivated, if you have a PCI passthrough device assigned to a NUMA node, attempts to remove the device end with an error. In the vSphere Client, you see messages such as Invalid virtual machine configuration. Virtual NUMA cannot be configured when CPU hotadd is enabled.Workaround: See VMware knowledge base article [89638](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89638).**If you deploy a virtual machine from an OVF file or from the Content Library, the number of cores per socket for the VM is set to 1**If you deploy a virtual machine from an OVF file or from the Content Library, instead of ESXi automatically selecting the number of cores per socket, the number is pre-set to 1.Workaround: You can manually set the number of cores per socket by using the vSphere Client. For more information, see VMware knowledge base article [89639](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/89639).**If you configure a VM at HW version earlier than 20 with a Vendor Device Group, such VMs might not work as expected**Vendor Device Groups, which enable binding of high-speed networking devices and the GPU, are supported only on VMs with HW version 20 and later, but you are not prevented to configure a VM at HW version earlier than 20 with a Vendor Device Group. Such VMs might not work as expected: for example, fail to power-on.Workaround: Ensure that VM HW version is of version 20 before you configure a Vendor Device Group in that VM.
## Networking Issues

**You cannot set the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) on a VMware vSphere Distributed Switch to a value larger than 9174 on a Pensando DPU**If you have the vSphere Distributed Services Engine feature with a Pensando DPU enabled on your ESXi 8.0 system, you cannot set the Maximum Transmission Unit (MTU) on a vSphere Distributed Switch to a value larger than 9174.Workaround: None.**You see link flapping on NICs that use the ntg3 driver of version 4.1.3 and later**When two NICs that use the ntg3 driver of versions 4.1.3 and later are connected directly, not to a physical switch port, link flapping might occur. The issue does not occur on ntg3 drivers of versions earlier than 4.1.3 or the tg3 driver. This issue is not related to the occasional Energy Efficient Ethernet (EEE) link flapping on such NICs. The fix for the EEE issue is to use a ntg3 driver of version 4.1.7 or later, or disable EEE on physical switch ports.Workaround: Upgrade the ntg3 driver to version 4.1.8 and set the new module parameter noPhyStateSet to 1. The noPhyStateSet parameter defaults to 0 and is not required in most environments, except they face the issue.**VMware NSX installation or upgrade in a vSphere environment with DPUs might fail with a connectivity error**An intermittent timing issue on the ESXi host side might cause NSX installation or upgrade in a vSphere environment with DPUs to fail. In the nsxapi.log file you see logs such as Failed to get SFHC response. MessageType MT\_SOFTWARE\_STATUS.Workaround: Wait for 10 min and retry the NSX install or upgrade.**If you do not reboot an ESXi host after you enable or disable SR-IOV with the icen driver, when you configure a transport node in ENS Interrupt mode on that host, some virtual machines might not get DHCP addresses**If you enable or disable SR-IOV with the icen driver on an ESXi host and configure a transport node in ENS Interrupt mode, some Rx (receive) queues might not work if you do not reboot the host. As a result, some virtual machines might not get DHCP addresses.Workaround: Either add a transport node profile directly, without enabling SR-IOV, or reboot the ESXi host after you enable or disable SR-IOV.**You cannot use Mellanox ConnectX-5, ConnectX-6 cards Model 1 Level 2 and Model 2 for Enhanced Network Stack (ENS) mode in vSphere 8.0**Due to hardware limitations, Model 1 Level 2, and Model 2 for Enhanced Network Stack (ENS) mode in vSphere 8.0 is not supported in ConnectX-5 and ConnectX-6 adapter cards.Workaround: Use Mellanox ConnectX-6 Lx and ConnectX-6 Dx or later cards that support ENS Model 1 Level 2, and Model 2A.**Pensando DPUs do not support Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) on physical switch ports of ESXi hosts**When you enable LLDP on an ESXi host with a DPU, the host cannot receive LLDP packets.Workaround: None.
## Storage Issues

**VASA API version does not automatically refresh after upgrade to vCenter Server 8.0**vCenter Server 8.0 supports VASA API version 4.0. However, after you upgrade your vCenter Server system to version 8.0, the VASA API version might not automatically change to 4.0. You see the issue in 2 cases:

- If a VASA provider that supports VASA API version 4.0 is registered with a previous version of VMware vCenter, the VASA API version remains unchanged after you upgrade to VMware vCenter 8.0. For example, if you upgrade a VMware vCenter system of version 7.x with a registered VASA provider that supports both VASA API versions 3.5 and 4.0, the VASA API version does not automatically change to 4.0, even though the VASA provider supports VASA API version 4.0. After the upgrade, when you navigate to **vCenter Server** > **Configure** > **Storage Providers** and expand the **General** tab of the registered VASA provider, you still see VASA API version 3.5.
- If you register a VASA provider that supports VASA API version 3.5 with a VMware vCenter 8.0 system and upgrade the VASA API version to 4.0, even after the upgrade, you still see VASA API version 3.5.
Workaround: Unregister and re-register the VASA provider on the VMware vCenter 8.0 system.**vSphere Storage vMotion operations might fail in a vSAN environment due to an unauthenticated session of the Network File Copy (NFC) manager**Migrations to a vSAN datastore by using vSphere Storage vMotion of virtual machines that have at least one snapshot and more than one virtual disk with different storage policy might fail. The issue occurs due to an unauthenticated session of the NFC manager because the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) body exceeds the allowed size.Workaround: First migrate the VM home namespace and just one of the virtual disks. After the operation completes, perform a disk only migration of the remaining 2 disks.**You cannot create snapshots of virtual machines due to an error in the Content Based Read Cache (CBRC) that a digest operation has failed**A rare race condition when assigning a content ID during the update of the CBRC digest file might cause a discrepancy between the content ID in the data disk and the digest disk. As a result, you cannot create virtual machine snapshots. You see an error such as An error occurred while saving the snapshot: A digest operation has failed in the backtrace. The snapshot creation task completes upon retry.Workaround: Retry the snapshot creation task.
## vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues

**The Utilization view of resource pools and clusters might not automatically refresh when you change the object**When you have already opened the **Utilization** view under the **Monitor** tab for a resource pool or a cluster and then you change the resource pool or cluster, the view might not automatically refresh. For example, when you open the **Utilization** view of one cluster and then select a different cluster, you might still see the statistics of the first cluster.Workaround: Click the refresh icon.**If you load the vSphere virtual infrastructure to more than 90%, ESXi hosts might intermittently disconnect from vCenter Server**In rare occasions, if the vSphere virtual infrastructure is continuously using more than 90% of its hardware capacity, some ESXi hosts might intermittently disconnect from the vCenter Server. Connection typically restores within a few seconds.Workaround: If connection to vCenter Server accidentally does not restore in a few seconds, reconnect ESXi hosts manually by using vSphere Client.**In the vSphere Client, you do not see banner notifications for historical data imports**Due to a backend issue, you do not see banner notifications for background migration of historical data in the vSphere Client.Workaround: Use the vCenter Server Management Interface as an alternative to the vSphere Client. For more information, see [Monitor and Manage Historical Data Migration](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/8.0/vsphere-vcenter-upgrade/GUID-82BF6D0C-211E-4862-AC6C-C7DEDA564D90.html).**You see an error for Cloud Native Storage (CNS) block volumes created by using API in a mixed vCenter environment**If your environment has vCenter Server systems of version 8.0 and 7.x, creating Cloud Native Storage (CNS) block volume by using API is successful, but you might see an error in the vSphere Client, when you navigate to see the CNS volume details. You see an error such as Failed to extract the requested data. Check vSphere Client logs for details. + TypeError: Cannot read properties of null (reading 'cluster'). The issue occurs only if you review volumes managed by the 7.x vCenter Server by using the vSphere Client of an 8.0 vCenter Server.Workaround: Log in to vSphere Client on a vCenter Server system of version 7.x to review the volume properties.**ESXi hosts might become unresponsive, and you see a vpxa dump file due to a rare condition of insufficient file descriptors for the request queue on vpxa**In rare cases, when requests to the vpxa service take long, for example waiting for access to a slow datastore, the request queue on vpxa might exceed the limit of file descriptors. As a result, ESXi hosts might briefly become unresponsive, and you see a vpxa-zdump.00\* file in the /var/core directory. The vpxa logs contain the line Too many open files.Workaround: None. The vpxa service automatically restarts and corrects the issue.
## Virtual Machine Management Issues

**When you add an existing virtual hard disk to a new virtual machine, you might see an error that the VM configuration is rejected**When you add an existing virtual hard disk to a new virtual machine by using the VMware Host Client, the operation might fail with an error such as The VM configuration was rejected. Please see browser Console. The issue occurs because the VMware Host Client might fail to get some properties, such as the hard disk controller.Workaround: After you select a hard disk and go to the **Ready to complete** page, do not click **Finish**. Instead, return one step back, wait for the page to load, and then click **Next** > **Finish**.
## Security Features Issues

**If you use an RSA key size smaller than 2048 bits, RSA signature generation fails**Starting from vSphere 8.0, ESXi uses the OpenSSL 3.0 FIPS provider. As part of the FIPS 186-4 requirement, the RSA key size must be at least 2048 bits for any signature generation, and signature generation with SHA1 is not supported.Workaround: Use RSA key size larger than 2048.
## vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues

**If a parallel remediation task fails, you do not see the correct number of ESXi hosts that passed or skipped the operation**With vSphere 8.0, you can enable vSphere Lifecycle Manager to remediate all hosts that are in maintenance mode in parallel instead of in sequence. However, if a parallel remediation task fails, in the vSphere Client you might not see the correct number of hosts that passed, failed, or skipped the operation, or even not see such counts at all. The issue does not affect the vSphere Lifecycle Manager functionality, but only the reporting in the vSphere Client.Workaround: None.**If you use an ESXi host deployed from a host profile with enabled stateful install as an image to deploy other ESXi hosts in a cluster, the operation fails**If you extract an image of an ESXi host deployed from a host profile with enabled stateful install to deploy other ESXi hosts in a vSphere Lifecycle Manager cluster, the operation fails. In the vSphere Client, you see an error such as A general system error occurred: Failed to extract image from the host: no stored copy available for inactive VIB VMW\_bootbank\_xxx. Extraction of image from host xxx.eng.vmware.com failed.Workaround: Use a different host from the cluster to extract an image.**You see error messages when try to stage vSphere Lifecycle Manager Images on ESXi hosts of version earlier than 8.0**ESXi 8.0 introduces the option to explicitly stage desired state images, which is the process of downloading depot components from the vSphere Lifecycle Manager depot to the ESXi hosts without applying the software and firmware updates immediately. However, staging of images is only supported on an ESXi 8.0 or later hosts. Attempting to stage a vSphere Lifecycle Manager image on ESXi hosts of version earlier than 8.0 results in messages that the staging of such hosts fails, and the hosts are skipped. This is expected behavior and does not indicate any failed functionality as all ESXi 8.0 or later hosts are staged with the specified desired image.Workaround: None. After you confirm that the affected ESXi hosts are of version earlier than 8.0, ignore the errors.**A remediation task by using vSphere Lifecycle Manager might intermittently fail on ESXi hosts with DPUs**When you start a vSphere Lifecycle Manager remediation on an ESXi hosts with DPUs, the host upgrades and reboots as expected, but after the reboot, before completing the remediation task, you might see an error such as:A general system error occurred: After host … remediation completed, compliance check reported host as 'non-compliant'. The image on the host does not match the image set for the cluster. Retry the cluster remediation operation.This is a rare issue, caused by an intermittent timeout of the post-remediation scan on the DPU.Workaround: Reboot the ESXi host and re-run the vSphere Lifecycle Manager compliance check operation, which includes the post-remediation scan.
## VMware Host Client Issues

**VMware Host Client might display incorrect descriptions for severity event states**When you look in the VMware Host Client to see the descriptions of the severity event states of an ESXi host, they might differ from the descriptions you see by using Intelligent Platform Management Interface (IPMI) or Lenovo XClarity Controller (XCC). For example, in the VMware Host Client, the description of the severity event state for the PSU Sensors might be Transition to Non-critical from OK, while in the XCC and IPMI, the description is Transition to OK.Workaround: Verify the descriptions for severity event states by using the ESXCLI command esxcli hardware ipmi sdr list and Lenovo XCC.
## Guest OS Issues

**The guest operating system of a VM might become unresponsive due to lost communication over the Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI)**In very specific circumstances, when a vSphere vMotion operation on a virtual machine runs in parallel with an operation that sends VMCI datagrams, services that use VMCI datagrams might see unexpected communication or loss of communication. Under the same conditions, the issue can also happen when restoring a memory snapshot, resuming a suspended VM or using CPU Hot Add.
