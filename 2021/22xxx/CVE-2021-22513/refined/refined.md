The provided content relates to CVE-2021-22513.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The OpenText Application Automation Tools Plugin does not perform permission checks in methods implementing form validation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Missing permission checks.
- Cross-site request forgery (CSRF) due to not requiring POST requests for form validation methods.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker with Overall/Read permission can connect to attacker-specified URLs using attacker-specified username and password. The CSRF vulnerability allows an attacker to perform actions on behalf of a victim user by tricking them into interacting with a malicious webpage.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network.
- Exploitation via CSRF.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have Overall/Read permission to exploit the missing permission checks vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to trick a victim user into interacting with a malicious webpage to trigger a CSRF attack.
