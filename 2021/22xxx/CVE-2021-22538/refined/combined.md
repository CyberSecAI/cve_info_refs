# Changes since v0.23.0

## Security

* Fix a security vulnerability where, with a carefully crafted request or malicious proxy, a user with UserWrite permissions could create another user with higher privileges than their own due to insufficient checks on the allowed set of permissions.
* Re-auth login redirect uses allowlist for post auth redirects. ([#1919](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/1919), [@mikehelmick](https://github.com/mikehelmick))

## Bug fixes

* Fixes nilptr error in stats puller (not in a previous labeled release) ([#1911](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/1911), [@mikehelmick](https://github.com/mikehelmick))

## System admin

* Add chaff reporting to system admin page. This will show whether a realm has issue *any* chaff requests in the past 7 days. ([#1903](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/1903), [@sethvargo](https://github.com/sethvargo))

## Operations

* Add client-side retry logic and parallelize stats puller. The default parallelize is 5, but it can be customized with `STATS_PULLER_MAX_WORKERS`. There is also a **behavior change**. The stats-puller previously always returned success (but logged errors on failure). This changes the puller to return a non-200 response code if there are still failures after all retries have executed. ([#1905](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/1905), [@sethvargo](https://github.com/sethvargo))
* Allow customizing global log retention period for all services in the project. The default value is 14 days. **Note: this differs from the unconfigured value of 30 days!**. To retain the existing behavior, set `log_retention_period` to `30` in the Terraform configuration. However, we strongly recommend using a 14-day retention period instead. ([#1902](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/1902), [@sethvargo](https://github.com/sethvargo))
* Improve service timeouts. In-request services have a timeout of 10 seconds while background jobs have a timeout of 900s. The Cloud Scheduler timeout (which invokes the background jobs) has a 60s buffer to reduce timeout races. ([#1916](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/1916), [@sethvargo](https://github.com/sethvargo))
* Remove modeler backend service (it is not public-facing). ([#1917](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/1917), [@sethvargo](https://github.com/sethvargo))
* Set Binary Authorization service annotations on Cloud Run services. ([#1909](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/1909), [@sethvargo](https://github.com/sethvargo))

## Misc

* Indonesia (id) language translation ([#1890](https://github.com/google/exposure-notifications-verification-server/pull/1890), [@dwisiswant0](https://github.com/dwisiswant0))

# Privilege escalation in rbac

Moderate

[sethvargo](/sethvargo)
published
GHSA-5v95-v8c8-3rh6
Mar 15, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 0.23.0

## Patched versions

0.23.1, 0.24.0

## Description

### Impact

Using a carefully crafted request or malicious proxy, a user with `UserWrite` permissions could create another user with higher privileges than their own due to insufficient checks on the allowed set of permissions. The event would be captured in the Event Log.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in 0.24.0 and 0.23.1.

### Workarounds

For users who are unable to upgrade, we recommend auditing users who have `UserWrite` permissions and regularly reviewing the Event Log for malicious activity.

### Kudos

Thank you to Michael Mazzolini (Ethical Hacker at WHO) for finding and disclosing this vulnerability.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-22538

### Weaknesses

[CWE-269](/advisories?query=cwe%3A269)
