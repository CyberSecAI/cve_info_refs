Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Insufficient checks on the allowed set of permissions when creating a new user. Specifically, the system did not properly validate if a user with `UserWrite` permissions was attempting to grant higher privileges than they themselves possessed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
  - Privilege Escalation: A user with `UserWrite` permissions could exploit the lack of proper permission validation to create a new user with elevated privileges (higher than their own).
  - Inadequate Input Validation: The system failed to validate the permissions being set, allowing crafted requests to bypass permission restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
  - Unauthorized Access: An attacker could create a new user with admin-level privileges, gaining complete control over the affected system.
  - Data Breach/Manipulation: With elevated privileges, the attacker could access sensitive data, modify configurations, or perform malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
  - Malicious Proxy: An attacker could use a malicious proxy to modify the request payload and bypass validation checks.
  - Crafted Request:  A carefully constructed request directly to the system's API could be used to escalate privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
  - User with `UserWrite` permissions is required.
  - Ability to send crafted requests or use a malicious proxy to intercept and modify requests is necessary.

**Additional Notes:**
  - The vulnerability is fixed in versions 0.23.1 and 0.24.0.
  - The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-22538 and GHSA-5v95-v8c8-3rh6.
  - The fix involves adding a check to ensure a user cannot grant permissions higher than their own.
  -  The vulnerability was found and disclosed by Michael Mazzolini (Ethical Hacker at WHO).
  - The weakness is categorized as CWE-269 (Improper Privilege Management).
