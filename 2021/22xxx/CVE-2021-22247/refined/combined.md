# Guest in private project can see CI/CD Analytics

**[HackerOne report #1074326](https://hackerone.com/reports/1074326)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2021-01-08, assigned to [@dcouture](/dcouture "Dominic Couture"):

[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

##### Summary

Hello,

This is most probably documentation error but reporting this as you have mentioned in policy `Reports about intended behavior resulting in an update of our documentation will be rewarded with a $100 bounty, as long as this update is security related.`

As per document of user permission, `https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html`, Guest should not be able to see `View CI/CD analytics`  I think it is wrongly mentioned as guest can see CI/CD Analytics in private projects. Not too sure if there are any recent changes though but in any case, either document or code need fixing!

##### Steps to reproduce

1. Login as guest in private project and you can see CI/CD Analytics option and can browse too!

Regards,

Ashish

#### Impact

Guest in private project can see CI/CD Analytics
