- **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The `SchedulerServer` in VMware Photon OS is vulnerable to log injection due to insufficient input sanitization. Specifically, the package parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject carriage return (`\r`) characters.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The primary vulnerability is a CRLF injection, which is a type of log injection vulnerability. By injecting carriage return and line feed characters (`\r\n`), an attacker can manipulate log output, potentially inserting arbitrary data, including malicious code, or creating fake entries.
- **Impact of Exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious data into system logs. This could be used to hide malicious activity, create false audit trails, or potentially leverage other vulnerabilities if the manipulated log data is later processed by other vulnerable systems or applications.
- **Attack Vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted request to the `SchedulerServer` with a malformed package parameter containing carriage return characters.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable `SchedulerServer`. No specific position inside the network is mentioned, so it could potentially be exploited remotely over the network.
