Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22874:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `period_preset` parameter in `userlog-index.php` was not properly escaped when printed within a JavaScript context.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could trick a user with access to the Revive Adserver interface into clicking a malicious link.
*   Upon clicking the link, injected JavaScript code could be executed within the user's browser.
*   Although the session cookie is not directly accessible via Javascript, malicious HTML and Javascript injection is still possible.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a URL containing the malicious payload in the `period_preset` parameter.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into clicking on the crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need any privileges on the Revive Adserver instance.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and then convince a valid user to click on it.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the existing escaping was circumvented by injecting a closing `</script>` tag, allowing the attacker to add arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code.
*   The provided fix in the commit e2a67ce8 addresses this by using `addcslashes` which should properly escape the injected value.
