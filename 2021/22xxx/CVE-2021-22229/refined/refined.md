{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "When a project member forks a project with repository visibility set to 'Only Project Members', the forked project defaults to public visibility, unintentionally exposing proprietary source code.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Incorrect handling of visibility settings during the fork operation. Specifically, the repository visibility setting is not preserved when a project is forked.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Unintentional exposure of proprietary source code which could lead to data leaks and unauthorized access to sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "A project member forks a project with restricted repository visibility.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be a project member of a project with repository visibility set to 'Only Project Members'."
