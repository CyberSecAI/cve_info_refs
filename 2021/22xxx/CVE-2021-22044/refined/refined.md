- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the use of type-level `@RequestMapping` annotations on Feign client interfaces. When such annotations are used, the methods on the interface can become unintentionally exposed as endpoints.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unintended exposure of server-side endpoints through Feign client interfaces due to the use of type-level `@RequestMapping` annotations.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Although no response is returned, the request reaches the server-side endpoint, potentially allowing attackers to trigger server-side actions and expose sensitive functionality through the unintentional endpoints.
- **Attack vectors:** By sending a request to the exposed endpoint on the client side (although the server is the one receiving the request), attackers can trigger unintended server side actions.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the unintentionally exposed endpoints in the application.
