These options allow an administrator to retrieve the list of groups a user is associated with after successfully authenticating to an event.  *NOTE:*The Return Group on Logon is enabled by default for all the events except the Authenticators Management, Smartphone Enrollment, OAuth 2.0, and SAML 2.0 events.  For more information, see [Configuring an Existing Event](../../server-administrator-guide/data/config_exst_event.html#config_exst_event) in the [Advanced Authentication - Administration](../../server-administrator-guide/data/bookinfo.html#bookinfo) guide. |

### 1.2 Security Improvements

Advanced Authentication 6.3 Service Pack 4 Patch 1 resolves a potential Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) downgrade issue (CVE-2021-22515).

We would like to offer a special thanks to Julkair for responsibly disclosing this issue.

### 1.3 Software Fixes

This release includes the following fixes:

| Component | Description |
| Enrollment Portal | The Delete option for the SMS OTP and Email OTP methods is not available in the old Enrollment portal. |
| Enrollment Portal | When a user logs in to the old Enrollment portal by performing the basic authentication and tries to enroll the TOTP method, the QR code is not displayed. |
| Enrollment Portal | When a user connects the Spanish national identity card (Documento Nacional de identidad) and tries to enroll it using the PKI method, the certificate is not displayed in the Key field.  However, on click of Show All, certificates are displayed. When the user selects a certificate, the following error message is displayed:  Cannot check the revocation status. |
| RADIUS | The RADIUS server does not return the msRADIUSFramedIPAddress attribute if the hexadecimal value of that attribute contains a negative value. |
| Web Authentication | When the users from LDAP repositories try to log in to the Enrollment Portal, the following error message is displayed:  WebAuth feature is not running.  This issue happens only for LDAP users who are associated with many groups and many nested groups. The local users can log in without any problem. |

## 2.0 Known Issues

NetIQ Corporation strives to ensure our products provide quality solutions for your enterprise software needs. The following issues are currently being researched. If you need further assistance with any issue, please contact [Technical Support](http://www.netiq.com/support).

Advanced Authentication 6.3 Service Pack 4 Patch 1 includes the following known issue:

* [Windows Client Does Not Respond](#t4dxmp0l5u7n)
* [Syslog is Flooded with the Health Check Messages](#t4f8j0c9h403)
* [Issue with Risk Service After Upgrade](#t4fcfosop51y)

### 2.1 Windows Client Does Not Respond

When a user tries to authenticate to Windows Client, it freezes in the Please wait screen after providing the username. This happens only in Windows machines with external Nvidia Quadro graphics cards and their drivers installed.

### 2.2 Syslog is Flooded with the Health Check Messages

There are various messages as follows:

dockerd[2167]: time="2020-12-21T23:30:22.663706880Z" level=warning msg="Health check for container b1cc02cc52d3fe2681c9fa60abfab62aa54fa40d4d833fca4bb0fef5d0414890 error: context deadline exceeded" in syslog.

These messages do not indicate any issues. This is due to the absence of the Risk Service license.

*Workaround:*
Perform the following steps:

1. Log in to the Configuration Portal (:9443).
2. Click System Services and select the Risk Service then click Action and select Stop.
3. Click Options then select Set as Manual for Risk Service.

### 2.3 Issue with Risk Service After Upgrade

*Issue:*
The Risk Service does not work after upgrading to Advanced Authentication 6.3 SP4.

*Workaround:*
Run the following commands to remove the old rba\_history container and reboot the appliance:

1. systemctl stop docker
2. systemctl start docker
3. docker container stop risk\_rbahistory\_1
4. docker container rm risk\_rbahistory\_1
5. docker rmi -f mfsecurity/rba\_history:1.0.0.2
6. reboot
7. Log in to the Administration portal and click Logs > Clear to clear the logs.

*NOTE:*If any command takes too long to respond or hangs, press Ctrl+C to stop and continue with the next step.
