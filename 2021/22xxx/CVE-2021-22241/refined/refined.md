{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The 'default branch name' of a group accepts arbitrary text without sanitization, leading to an injection vulnerability when displayed on a project's main page.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary JavaScript execution within the victim's browser when accessing a project's main page. This can lead to various malicious activities depending on the instance's CSP settings.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Setting a malicious 'default branch name' in a group.",
      "Creating a project within the group.",
      "Inviting victims as 'Developers' to the project or direct access to a project by an admin"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create and modify groups and projects within the GitLab instance. They need to have the ability to invite other users to projects."
  },
  "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the project's 'getting started' information page includes unsanitized output of the group's 'default branch name'. A lack of proper Content Security Policy (CSP) can exacerbate the impact, allowing for actions such as stealing user tokens or redirecting users to attacker-controlled sites. On GitLab.com, the attacker can change the base-uri via the malicious input."
