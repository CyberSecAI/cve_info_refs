  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Crafted Markdown files trigger performance issues in the Markdown renderers, causing unexpectedly long execution times.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Performance bug in Markdown rendering",
      "Unbounded CPU consumption"
    ],
    "impact": "Server-side denial of service (DoS). The server becomes unavailable due to high CPU usage caused by rendering crafted markdown, affecting normal users and operations.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Submitting crafted markdown files through the browser user interface",
       "Submitting crafted markdown files through the API endpoint /api/v4/markdown"
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Any user who can submit markdown files for rendering (including unauthenticated users if the API is exposed publicly)."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability can be triggered by submitting a markdown file containing multiple nested code blocks, specifically 'css' and 'typescript', as described in the provided report. The reported version of GitLab CE was 13.8.1. The issue was found in the markdown rendering engine itself and can be triggered both by using the UI or the API. There is an assumption that GitLab.com can be impacted as well if not fixed."
