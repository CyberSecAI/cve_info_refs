Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation when a specific module in Huawei smartphones processes messages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability: The module reads memory outside of the intended buffer due to missing input checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Compromising normal service: The out-of-bounds read could lead to unexpected behavior, potentially disrupting the device's functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Sending malicious input: An attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending specially crafted messages to the affected module via a specific pathway.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to send messages to the vulnerable module through a specific pathway. The document specifies "Attackers can send message to affected module through specific module."

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as HWPSIRT-2020-06146.
- The affected product is HUAWEI Mate 30 with version 10.0.0.182(C00E180R6P2), which is fixed in version 11.0.0.155(C00E150R7P11).
- The CVSSv3 base score is 4.6 (AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) which means the attack vector is physical, the attack complexity is low, no privileges are required, there is no user interaction, scope is unchanged, confidentiality impact is none, integrity impact is none and availability impact is high.
- The CVSSv3 temporal score is 4.3 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C) which means the exploit code is functional, the remediation level is official fix and the report confidence is confirmed.
