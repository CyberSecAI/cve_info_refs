       "response": "The provided content indicates that CVE-2021-22877 is related to a vulnerability in Nextcloud where stored credentials could be accessed by other users. \n\n**Root cause of vulnerability:**\nThe vulnerability arises from how Nextcloud handles credentials for external storage mounts, specifically SMB mounts. When an admin navigates to the user list page, the system incorrectly populates the `oc_storages_credentials` table with credentials, including for users who have not logged in yet. These credentials seem to be derived from the admin's context, and are then not updated when the actual user logs in.\n\n**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**\n- Incorrect population of the `oc_storages_credentials` table with admin-derived credentials for all users, including those who haven't logged in. \n- Failure to update the credentials in the database when a user logs in, if credentials already exist from the admin-triggered pre-population.\n- Use of `is_null($credentials)` in `Files_External\\Lib\\Auth\\Password\\LoginCredentials.php` leading to not updating the credentials when the user is logged in.\n\n**Impact of exploitation:**\n- Users are unable to access their external storage mounts (e.g., SMB shares) due to incorrect credentials being stored for their accounts. \n- Unauthorized access to resources in external storage is possible because of the credential sharing vulnerability.\n\n**Attack vectors:**\n- An administrator navigating to the user list page (`/settings/users`) triggers the vulnerability, causing incorrect credentials to be stored in the database for all users. \n- Subsequent user login attempts then fail due to the incorrect credentials being used.\n\n**Required attacker capabilities/position:**\n- An attacker would need to be an administrator on the Nextcloud instance to trigger the vulnerability.\n- No specific user interaction is required beyond typical administrative tasks.\n\n**Additional Details:**\nThe provided GitHub issue and pull request reveal the vulnerability and the fix:\n\n- The issue #24600 describes the problem of malformed credentials being saved in `oc_storages_credentials`.\n- The pull request #25224 includes the fix that ensures credentials of another user are not saved and also fixes the username and ensures the login name is stored via the event.\n- The fix involves verifying if user is logged in via  `\\OC::$server->getUserSession()->isLoggedIn()` to avoid pre-populating the table with admin's context credentials.\n"
