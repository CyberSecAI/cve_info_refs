Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE-2021-22196**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `source_branch` variable within the `_sidebar.html.haml` template. This allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code through the branch name.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The unsanitized `source_branch` is used directly within the `title` attribute of a `cite` tag.
    *   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input (the branch name) before displaying it on the page.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a victim's browser when they view the affected merge request page.
    *   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal session cookies, leading to account compromise.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could leverage the access to the GitLab API to perform actions on behalf of the victim, such as modifying data, creating resources, or triggering further malicious activities.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious Branch Name:** The attacker crafts a malicious branch name containing the XSS payload (e.g., HTML/JavaScript).
    *   **Git Push:** The attacker pushes the malicious branch to the GitLab repository.
    *   **Merge Request Creation:** The attacker creates a merge request involving the malicious branch.
    *   **Victim Access:**  The victim views the merge request page, triggering the stored XSS.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Access to the Git Repository:** The attacker needs write access to the repository or have the ability to create new branches (through a fork).
    *   **Ability to Create Merge Requests:**  The attacker needs the ability to create merge requests involving the malicious branch.

**Summary of the XSS:**
The core issue is that the `source_branch` variable is not sanitized when being used in a `title` attribute within the `_sidebar.html.haml` template. This allows for stored XSS when a malicious branch name is created and a merge request involving it is viewed. The attacker crafts a branch name containing a malicious payload, pushes it to the repo, creates a merge request, and when a victim visits the merge request the javascript within the title tag is executed.
