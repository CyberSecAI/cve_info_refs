- **Root cause of vulnerability**: RabbitMQ installers on Windows prior to version 3.8.16 do not properly harden plugin directory permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient file system permissions on the RabbitMQ plugin directory. This allows attackers with local filesystem access to add arbitrary plugins.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution on the running RabbitMQ server.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with sufficient local filesystem permissions can add malicious plugins.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local filesystem access to the machine running the vulnerable RabbitMQ server.
