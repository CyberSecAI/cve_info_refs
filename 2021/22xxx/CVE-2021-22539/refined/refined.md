- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `vscode-bazel` extension allows workspace settings to modify the path of an executable file used for linting `.bzl` files (specifically the `bazel.buildifierExecutable` setting). This setting can be altered by placing a crafted JSON config file within the project folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in the ability to modify the executable path used by the extension, allowing execution of arbitrary programs.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution by placing a malicious JSON config file within a project that is opened using `vscode-bazel`.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local, where the attacker must have the ability to add the malicious JSON configuration to the project directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to write files within the project directory that will be opened by a user using the vulnerable VSCode extension.  The user of the VSCode extension must also interact with the project by opening the project folder using the vulnerable extension.
