  "CVE-2021-22925": {
    "description": "curl could potentially reveal sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol",
    "root_cause": "A buffer overflow in curl's TELNET option parser when sending NEW_ENV variables led to the disclosure of uninitialized data from a stack-based buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Buffer Overflow",
      "Exposure of Sensitive Information"
    ],
    "impact": "Sensitive internal information may be revealed to a remote server using clear-text protocols.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker can exploit this via a malicious TELNET server or by intercepting and manipulating the traffic between a curl client and a legitimate TELNET server. No specific user interaction is required on the client-side other than sending the malicious telnet option"
