Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22006:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vCenter Server contains a reverse proxy bypass vulnerability due to the way the endpoints handle the URI. This allows a malicious actor to bypass intended access restrictions to specific endpoints by manipulating the URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Reverse Proxy Bypass:** The core issue is that the reverse proxy mechanism does not properly validate or handle URIs, allowing attackers to bypass intended access controls and reach restricted endpoints.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access to Restricted Endpoints:** By exploiting this vulnerability, a malicious actor can gain unauthorized access to internal or restricted endpoints of vCenter Server that are normally protected by the reverse proxy.
- **Potential for Further Exploitation:** Access to these endpoints can lead to further attacks, such as information disclosure, data manipulation, or denial-of-service conditions, depending on the functionality of the specific endpoint exposed.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:** The primary attack vector is through network access to port 443 of the vCenter Server. This suggests the vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
- **URI manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the URI to bypass the reverse proxy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access to vCenter:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the vCenter Server on port 443.
- **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited without any prior authentication to the vCenter Server.

**Additional Information**
- This issue does not affect vCenter Server 6.5.
- The vulnerability was reported by George Noseevich (@webpentest) and Sergey Gerasimov of SolidLab LLC.
- VMware has evaluated this issue to be in the "Important" severity range, with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 8.3.
