- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Kibana webhook actions lacked a timeout or limit on the request size, which could be abused by an attacker to create a denial of service.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Lack of timeout or request size limit in Kibana webhook actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with permissions to create webhook actions could drain the Kibana host connection pool, making Kibana unavailable for all other users, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: By creating webhook actions that do not timeout or send large requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs permissions to create webhook actions within Kibana.
