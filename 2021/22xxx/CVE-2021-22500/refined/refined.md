Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-22500:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The document states that the vulnerability allows an attacker to trick users into executing actions of the attacker's choosing. This implies a **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)** vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The vulnerability stems from the application's failure to properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to craft malicious requests that are executed by an authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can trick users into performing unintended actions within the Application Performance Management (APM) application. This could potentially lead to:
    *   Unauthorized data modification
    *   Unauthorized configuration changes
    *   Other actions within the scope of the user's privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious link or web page that, when accessed by an authenticated user of the APM application, would trigger the unintended action.
*   The document highlights that the attacker needs to trick a user, indicating that **user interaction is required** to trigger the vulnerability, which is characteristic of a CSRF attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges are required**: The attacker doesn't need to be an authenticated user, according to the provided information.
*   The attacker needs to be able to lure a legitimate user of the vulnerable APM system into clicking on a malicious link, or open a web page that executes the malicious requests in the background.
*   The attack relies on the user already being authenticated to the APM system.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The document provides CVSS scores for the vulnerability: 6.5 (v3.1 and v3) and 7.8 (v2).
*   The document mentions a resolution by directing the user to another page.
*   The vulnerable products are Micro Focus Application Performance Management (APM) versions 9.40, 9.50, and 9.51.
