- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Nextcloud Android app performs searches for share recipients on the lookup server by default, instead of only on the local Nextcloud server, unless the user explicitly chooses a global search. This exposes user search queries to an external server when it is not expected by the user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information Exposure (CWE-201), unintentional leakage of user search queries to an external lookup server.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Users' search queries for share recipients are sent to the lookup server, potentially exposing sensitive information about the users they are searching for, or the nature of the files they wish to share.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is present in the Nextcloud Android client application. An attacker does not need any specific system access or capabilities to trigger this vulnerability. The application transmits search requests over the network to an external server without explicit user consent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special capabilities or position are required, as the application's default behavior leads to the information exposure. An attacker is the server receiving the search queries from the affected application.
