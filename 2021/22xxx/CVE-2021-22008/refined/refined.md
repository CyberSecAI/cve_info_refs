**CVE-2021-22008: vCenter Server Information Disclosure Vulnerability**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies within the vCenter API (VAPI) service. It stems from how the service processes specially crafted JSON-RPC messages.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Improper handling of JSON-RPC messages allows for unauthorized access to sensitive information.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:** A malicious actor can potentially gain access to sensitive information by exploiting this vulnerability.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attacker needs network access to port 443 on the vCenter Server.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker must have the ability to send crafted JSON-RPC messages to the vCenter Server through the network (port 443). No authentication is required.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**

*   **Severity:** VMware has rated this vulnerability as having a "Moderate" severity, with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of 5.3.
*   **Affected Products:**
