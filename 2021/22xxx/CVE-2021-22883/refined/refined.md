{
  "CVE-2021-22883": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the HTTP2 implementation where a large number of connections with an 'unknownProtocol' can lead to a leak of file descriptors.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Resource exhaustion",
       "File descriptor leak"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service (DoS). The server becomes unable to accept new connections and may prevent the process from opening files. In systems without file descriptor limits, the vulnerability leads to excessive memory usage, potentially causing the system to run out of memory.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "HTTP2 connections"
    ],
   "required_capabilities": "Attacker can establish HTTP2 connections to the vulnerable server."
  },
  "CVE-2021-22884": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient check in the whitelist of domains that can be used with the --inspect flag, specifically when 'localhost6' is included and not present in /etc/hosts.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DNS rebinding"
    ],
    "impact": "Bypassing DNS rebinding protection. An attacker controlling the victim's DNS server can use 'localhost6' to bypass the DNS rebinding protection, and then apply further attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "DNS spoofing"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "Attacker must be able to control victim's DNS server or spoof its responses."
