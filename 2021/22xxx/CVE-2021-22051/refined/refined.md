- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Specifically crafted requests can cause Spring Cloud Gateway to make an extra request to downstream services.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability lies in how Spring Cloud Gateway handles certain types of requests, leading to unintended extra requests being made. This is a request smuggling issue.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can potentially cause extra requests to be made to downstream services. This could lead to various impacts such as resource exhaustion, unexpected behavior in downstream systems, or potentially exposing vulnerabilities in those systems through unexpected interactions. The CVSS score indicates a Low impact on Confidentiality, High impact on Integrity and Low impact on Availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. The attacker crafts specific HTTP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs network access to the Spring Cloud Gateway instance and the ability to send crafted HTTP requests. A low level of privileges are needed according to the CVSS score.
