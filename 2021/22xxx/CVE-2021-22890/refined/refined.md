  "CVE-2021-22890": {
    "description": "libcurl can confuse TLS 1.3 session tickets from a HTTPS proxy with tickets from the target host, potentially bypassing the server TLS certificate check.",
    "root_cause": "The code was not updated to handle the modified sequence of session ID provision in TLS 1.3 where the session ids are provided after the handshake, unlike TLS 1.2.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Authentication Bypass by Spoofing (CWE-290)"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious HTTPS proxy can perform a MITM attack, circumventing the server TLS certificate check.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "A malicious HTTPS proxy is required to perform the attack."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Attacker must control a HTTPS proxy.",
      "The malicious proxy must provide a valid certificate for the target server (unless the client is configured to ignore server certificate checks).",
	  "The client must be using TLS 1.3 and communicating through a HTTPS proxy."
