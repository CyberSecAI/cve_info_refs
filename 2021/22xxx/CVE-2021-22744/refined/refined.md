- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions when processing malformed TriStation packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A CWE-754 Improper Check for Unusual or Exceptional Conditions vulnerability exists in the Model 3009/3009X MP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A successful attack can cause a module reset, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the affected module receives malformed TriStation packets. This requires physical access (AV:P).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have physical access to the affected system and must have the write-protect keyswitch in the PROGRAM position (PR:H). User interaction is required to set the keyswitch (UI:R).
