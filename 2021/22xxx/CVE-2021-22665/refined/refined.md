Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an "Uncontrolled Search Path Element" (CWE-427) in Rockwell Automation's DriveTools SP and Drives AOP software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The software does not properly control the locations it searches for executable files or libraries. This can allow an attacker to introduce malicious files which would then be executed by the vulnerable software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation may result in privilege escalation, potentially granting the attacker full control of the system.
-  It can lead to a total loss of device confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A local attacker with limited privileges can exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to place a malicious file in a location where the vulnerable software searches for its resources.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
- The attacker needs to have limited privileges on the system.
- Some level of technical knowledge is required to craft the malicious file and place it in the right location.
- User interaction is required as part of the attack.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected products are:
   - DriveTools SP v5.13 and below (including DriveExecutive v5.13 and below)
   - Drives AOP v4.12 and below (supports Logix Versions v16-v30)
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 with a vector string of AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H.
- The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
- A high skill level is needed to exploit.
- Rockwell Automation recommends updating to DriveTools SP v5.14.41 or later and Drives AOP v4.13.41 or later to mitigate the vulnerability.
- Other mitigation strategies include running the software as a user rather than an administrator, using allow list applications such as Microsoft AppLocker, and adhering to the least-privilege principle.
