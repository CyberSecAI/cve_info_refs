## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

Subject: CVE-2021-22569: Protobuf Java, Kotlin, JRuby DoS

Summary
A potential Denial of Service issue in protobuf-java was discovered in the
parsing procedure for binary data.
- Reporter: OSS-Fuzz [1]
- Affected versions: All versions of Java Protobufs (including Kotlin and
JRuby) prior to the versions listed below. Protobuf "javalite" users
(typically Android) are not affected.

Severity
CVE-2021-22569 High - CVSS Score: 7.5 [2]
An implementation weakness in how unknown fields are parsed in Java. A
small (~800 KB) malicious payload can occupy the parser for several minutes
by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause frequent,
repeated GC pauses.

Proof of Concept
For reproduction details, please refer to the oss-fuzz issue [3] that
identifies the specific inputs that exercise this parsing weakness.

Remediation and Mitigation
Please update to the latest available versions of the following packages:
- protobuf-java (3.16.1, 3.18.2, 3.19.2)
- protobuf-kotlin (3.18.2, 3.19.2)
- google-protobuf [JRuby gem] (3.19.2)

| A vulnerability was discovered in the Vertex AI API serving Gemini multimodal requests, allowing bypass of [VPC Service Controls](/vertex-ai/docs/general/vpc-service-controls). An attacker may be able to abuse the [`fileURI`](/vertex-ai/generative-ai/docs/reference/rest/v1/projects.locations.tuningJobs#FileData) parameter of the API to exfiltrate data.  **What should I do?**  No actions needed. We've implemented a fix to return an error message when a media file URL is specified in the fileUri parameter and VPC Service Controls is enabled. Other use cases are unaffected.  **What vulnerabilities are being addressed?**  The Cloud Support API serving Gemini multimodal requests lets you include media files by specifying the URL of the media file in the `fileUri` parameter. This capability can be used to bypass VPC Service Controls perimeters. An attacker inside the service perimeter could encode sensitive data in the `fileURI` parameter to bypass the service perimeter. | Medium | [CVE-2024-12236](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-12236) |

There are two Looker versions that are hosted by Looker:   * Looker (Google Cloud core) was found to be vulnerable. This issue has already been mitigated and our investigation has found no signs of exploitation. * Looker (original) was not vulnerable to this issue.   Customer-hosted Looker instances were found to be vulnerable and must be upgraded to one of the versions below.  This vulnerability has been patched in all supported versions of customer-hosted Looker, which are available on the [Looker download page](https://download.looker.com/). What should I do?  * For all Looker-hosted instances, including Looker (Google Cloud core) instances, there are no actions you need to take. * For Looker customer-hosted instances, please update to the latest supported version of Looker as soon as possible. The versions below have all been updated to protect from this vulnerability. You can download these versions at the Looker download page:   + 23.12 -> 23.12.123+   + 23.18 -> 23.18.117+   + 24.0 -> 24.0.92+   + 24.6 -> 24.6.77+   + 24.8 -> 24.8.66+   + 24.10 -> 24.10.78+   + 24.12 -> 24.12.56+   + 24.14 -> 24.14.37+  What vulnerabilities are being addressed? The vulnerability, CVE-2024-8912, allows an attacker to send crafted HTTP request headers to Looker, possibly resulting in the interception of HTTP responses destined for other users.  These responses could contain sensitive information.

| **2024-07-16 Updates:**  Some Serverless VPC Access customers are potentially impacted by a vulnerability in OpenSSH (CVE-2024-6387). In the case of successful exploit, this could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the target virtual machine. Exploitation is believed to be difficult. For example, customers can't access the VMs and the VMs don't have public IPs. We are not aware of any exploitation attempts.  **What should I do?**  Serverless VPC Access deployments have been automatically updated by Google where possible. However, you should verify that the [Google-managed service agent has its required role](https://cloud.google.com/vpc/docs/configure-serverless-vpc-access#service_account_permissions). If not, your Serverless VPC Access connector might still be vulnerable. We recommend that you [migrate to Direct VPC egress](https://cloud.google.com/run/docs/configuring/migrate-direct-vpc), or deploy a new connector and delete the old connector, to ensure that you have the required update with the fix.   ---   **2024-07-11 Update:** Added patch versions for GDC software for VMware, GKE on AWS, and GKE on Azure. For details, in the GKE documentation, see the following bulletins:  * [GDC software for VMware security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2024-040-gdcvmware) * [GKE on AWS security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2024-040-gkeaws) * [GKE on Azure security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2024-040-gkeazure)  ---   **2024-07-10 Update:**   * Added security bulletin for Migrate to Virtual Machines.  ---   **2024-07-09 Updates:**  Some App Engine flexible environment customers are potentially impacted by a vulnerability in OpenSSH (CVE-2024-6387). In the case of successful exploit, this could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the target virtual machine.  **What should I do?**  Google has already updated flexible environment deployments automatically where possible. However some customers who [disabled the Google-managed service agent](https://cloud.google.com/appengine/docs/flexible/service-agent#verify_the_service_agent), or made changes to the Google Cloud APIs or other default configurations, could not be updated and might still be vulnerable. You should deploy a new version of your app to pick up the update with the fix.  Please note that updated deployments will report ssh version `OpenSSH_9.6p1`. This version has been patched with a fix for CVE-2024-6387.  **What vulnerabilities are being addressed?**  The vulnerability CVE-2024-6387, which allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the target machine.   ---   **2024-07-08 Updates:**  Dataproc clusters on Google Compute Engine running on image version 2.2 (all operating systems) and 2.1 (Debian only) are impacted by a vulnerability in OpenSSH (CVE-2024-6387) which in case of successful exploit could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the target machine.  Dataproc on Google Compute Engine image versions 2.0 and 1.5, as well as Dataproc images version 2.1 not running on Debian, are not impacted. Dataproc clusters with Personal Authentication enabled are not impacted. Dataproc Serverless is also not impacted.  **What should I do?**  Please update your Dataproc clusters on Google Compute Engine to one the following versions:  * 2.2.24 or later * 2.1.58 or later  In case you are not able to update your Dataproc clusters to one of the versions above, we recommend using the initialization action available at this location: `gs://dataproc-initialization-actions/hotfixes/openssh-CVE-2024-6387-mitigation.sh`  Please follow these instructions on how to [specify initialization actions for Dataproc](/dataproc/docs/concepts/configuring-clusters/init-actions). Please note that the initialization action has to be run on every node (masters and workers) for pre-existing clusters.   ---   **2024-07-03 Updates:**   * Added patch versions for GKE. * Added security bulletin for GDC   connected.  ---   **2024-07-02 Updates:**   * Clarified that Autopilot clusters are impacted and   will require user action. * Added impact assessments and mitigation steps for   GDC software for VMware, GKE on AWS, and GKE on Azure. * Corrected the GDC software for bare metal security bulletin to clarify that GDC software for bare metal isn't directly   affected and that customers should check with OS vendors for patches.   --- | Critical | [CVE-2024-6387](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2024-6387) |

| Looker fixed vulnerabilities reported by an external researcher via the Google and Alphabet Vulnerability Reward Program (VRP) program, but found no evidence of exploitation. These issues are now resolved and no user action is required for Looker-hosted customers on Looker (Google Cloud core) and Looker (original). Self-hosted Looker instances are advised to update to the latest supported version.  **What should I do?**  **Looker-hosted instances: Looker (Google Cloud core) and Looker (original) instances** No customer action is required.  **Self-hosted Looker instances only**  If your Looker instance is self-hosted, we recommend upgrading your Looker instances to one of the following [versions](/looker/docs/officially-supported-releases):   * 24.6.12+ * 24.4.27+ * 24.2.58+ * 24.0.65+ * 23.18.100+ * 23.12.105+ * 23.6.163+   **How was this fixed?**  Google disabled direct administrative access to the internal database from the Looker application, removed elevated privileges that enabled cross-tenant access, and rotated the exposed secrets. Additionally, we have patched path traversal vulnerabilities that potentially exposed service account credentials. We are also conducting a thorough review of our code and systems to identify and address any similar potential vulnerabilities. | Critical |  |

| Researchers discovered a vulnerability ([CVE-2023-48022](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-48022)) in [Ray](https://www.ray.io/). Ray is a [third-party, open source tool](https://github.com/ray-project/ray) for AI workloads. Because Ray does not require authentication, threat actors can achieve remote code execution through submitting jobs to publicly exposed instances. The vulnerability has been [disputed by Anyscale](https://www.anyscale.com/blog/update-on-ray-cves-cve-2023-6019-cve-2023-6020-cve-2023-6021-cve-2023-48022-cve-2023-48023), the developer of Ray. Ray maintains its functions are an intended, core product feature, and that security must instead be implemented outside of a Ray cluster, as any unintended network exposure of the Ray cluster could lead to compromise.  Based on the response, this CVE is disputed and may not show up in vulnerability scanners. Regardless, it is being actively exploited in the wild and users should configure their usage as suggested below.  **What should I do?**  Follow Ray [best practices](https://docs.ray.io/en/latest/ray-security/index.html#best-practices) and guidelines, including running trusted code on trusted networks, in order to secure your Ray workloads. Deployment of [ray.io](http://ray.io/) in customer cloud instances falls under the model of shared responsibility.  Google Kubernetes Engine (GKE) security has published a [blog](/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/securing-ray-to-run-on-google-kubernetes-engine) on hardening Ray on GKE.  For further information on ways to add authentication and authorization to Ray services, consult the [Identity-Aware Proxy (IAP) documentation](/security/products/iap#documentation). GKE users can implement IAP following this [guidance](/iap/docs/enabling-kubernetes-howto) or by repurposing Terraform modules linked in the [blog](/blog/products/containers-kubernetes/securing-ray-to-run-on-google-kubernetes-engine). | High | [CVE-2023-48022](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-48022) |

| TorchServe is used to host PyTorch machine learning models for online prediction. Vertex AI provides prebuilt PyTorch model serving containers which depend on TorchServe. Vulnerabilities were recently discovered in TorchServe which would allow an attacker to take control of a TorchServe deployment if its model management API is exposed. Customers with PyTorch models deployed to Vertex AI online prediction are not affected by these vulnerabilities, since Vertex AI does not expose TorchServe's model management API. Customers using TorchServe outside of Vertex AI should take precautions to ensure their deployments are set up securely.  **What should I do?**  Vertex AI customers with deployed models using Vertex AI's [prebuilt PyTorch serving containers](/vertex-ai/docs/predictions/pre-built-containers#pytorch) do not need to take any action to address the vulnerabilities, since Vertex AI's deployments do not expose TorchServe's management server to the internet.  Customers who are using the prebuilt PyTorch containers in other contexts, or who are using a custom-built or third-party distribution of TorchServe, should do the following:   * Ensure that TorchServe's model management API is not exposed to the internet. The model management API can be restricted to local access only by ensuring that the `[management_address](https://pytorch.org/serve/configuration.html#configure-torchserve-listening-address-and-port)` is bound to `127.0.0.1`. * Use the `[allowed_urls](https://pytorch.org/serve/configuration.html#other-properties)` setting to ensure that models can be loaded from intended sources only. * Upgrade TorchServe to version 0.8.2, which includes mitigations for this issue, as soon as possible. As a precaution, Vertex AI will release fixed prebuilt containers by 2023-10-13.   **What vulnerabilities are being addressed?**  TorchServe's management API is bound to `0.0.0.0` by default in most TorchServe Docker images, including those released by Vertex AI, making it accessible to external requests. The default IP address for the management API is changed to `127.0.0.1` in TorchServe 0.8.2, mitigating this issue.  [CVE-2023-43654](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-43654) and [CVE-2022-1471](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1471) allow a user with access to the management API to load models from arbitrary sources and remotely execute code. Mitigations for both of these issues are included in TorchServe 0.8.2: the remote code execution path is removed, and a warning is emitted if the default value for `allowed_urls` is used. | High | [CVE-2023-43654](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2023-43654), [CVE-2022-1471](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1471) |

| **2024-05-29 Update**: The new feeds no longer use the shared service account, but it remains active for existing feeds to avoid service disruptions. Changes to the source in older feeds are blocked to prevent misuse of the shared service account. Customers can continue using their old feeds normally, as long as they don't change the source.  ---   Customers can configure Google Security Operations to ingest data from customer-owned Cloud Storage buckets using an ingestion feed. Until recently, Google Security Operations provided a shared service account that customers used to grant permission to the bucket. An opportunity existed such that one customer's Google Security Operations instance could be configured to ingest data from another customer's Cloud Storage bucket. After performing an impact analysis, we found no current or prior exploitation of this vulnerability. The vulnerability was present in all versions of Google Security Operations prior to Sept 19, 2023.  **What should I do?**  As of Sept 19, 2023, Google Security Operations has been updated to address this vulnerability. No customer action is required.  **What vulnerabilities are being addressed?**  Previously, Google Security Operations provided a shared service account that customers used to grant permission to a bucket. Because different customers gave the same Google Security Operations service account permission to their bucket, an exploitation vector existed that allowed one customer's feed to access a different customer's bucket when a feed was being created or modified. This exploitation vector required knowledge of the bucket URI. Now, during feed creation or modification, Google Security Operations uses unique service accounts for each customer. | High |  |

| The following CVEs expose Cloud Service Mesh to exploitable vulnerabilities:   * CVE-2023-35941: A malicious client is able to construct   credentials with permanent validity in some specific scenarios.   For example, the combination of host and expiration time in the   HMAC payload can be always valid in OAuth2 filter's HMAC check. * CVE-2023-35942: gRPC access loggers using the listener's global   scope can cause a use-after-free crash when the listener is   drained. This can be triggered by an LDS update with the same   gRPC access log configuration. * CVE-2023-35943: If `origin` header is configured to be   removed with `request_headers_to_remove: origin`, CORS   filter will `segfault` and crash Envoy. * CVE-2023-35944: Attackers can send mixed scheme requests to bypass   scheme checks in Envoy. For example, if a request with mixed   scheme HTTP is sent to the OAuth2 filter, it will fail the   exact-match checks for HTTP, and inform the remote endpoint the   scheme is HTTPS, thus potentially bypassing OAuth2 checks specific   to HTTP requests.

In April, we identified two vulnerabilities in 1.53 and 1.54 releases. One was a Denial-of-Service vulnerability within the gRPC's C++ implementation and the other was a remote data exfiltration vulnerability. These have been fixed in 1.53.1, 1.54.2 and later releases.  Previously in March, our internal teams discovered a Denial-of-Service vulnerability within the gRPC's C++ implementation while performing routine fuzzing activities. It was found in the gRPC 1.52 release, and has been fixed in the 1.52.2 and 1.53 releases. What should I do?

These patches mitigate the following vulnerabilities:   * 1.53.1, 1.54.2 and later releases address the following: Denial-Of-Service vulnerability in gRPC C++ implementation. Specially crafted requests can cause a termination of connection between a proxy and a backend. Remote data exfiltration vulnerability: Desynchronisation in the HPACK table due to header size limitations can lead to proxy backends leaking header data from other clients connected to a proxy.* 1.52.2, 1.53, and later releases address the following: Denial-of-Service vulnerability within the gRPC's C++ implementation.

| A message parsing and memory management vulnerability in ProtocolBuffer’s C++ and Python implementations can trigger an out of memory (OOM) failure when processing a specially crafted message. This could lead to a denial of service (DoS) on services using the libraries. What should I do? Ensure that you're using the latest versions of the following software packages:   * protobuf-cpp (3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 3.21.6) * protobuf-python (3.18.3, 3.19.5, 3.20.2, 4.21.6)  What vulnerabilities are addressed by this patch? The patch mitigates the following vulnerability:  A specially constructed small message that causes the running service to allocate large amounts of RAM. The small size of the request means that it is easy to take advantage of the vulnerability and exhaust resources. C++ and Python systems that consume untrusted protobufs would be vulnerable to DoS attacks if they contain a `MessageSet` object in their RPC request. | Medium | [CVE-2022-1941](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-1941) |

| **2022-11-22 Update:** For GKE clusters in both modes, Standard and Autopilot, workloads using [GKE Sandbox](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/sandbox-pods) are unaffected.   ---   A security vulnerability, CVE-2022-0847, has been discovered in the Linux kernel version 5.8 and later that can potentially escalate container privileges to root. This vulnerability affects the following products:   * GKE node pool versions 1.22 and later that use Container-Optimized OS images (Container-Optimized OS 93 and later) * GKE on VMware v1.10 for Container-Optimized OS images * GKE on AWS v1.21 and GKE on AWS (previous generation) v1.19, v1.20, v1.21, which use Ubuntu * Managed clusters of GKE on Azure v1.21 which use Ubuntu   For instructions and more details, see the following security bulletins:   * [GKE security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2022-012-gke) * [GKE on VMware security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2022-012-anthosvmware) * [GKE on AWS security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2022-012-anthosaws) * [GKE on Azure security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2022-012-anthosazure) * [Google Distributed Cloud Virtual for Bare Metal security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2022-012-anthosbm) | High | [CVE-2022-0847](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2022-0847) |

| **Update 2022-08-11:** Added more information about the Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT) configuration. SMT was intended to be disabled, but was enabled on the versions listed.  If you manually enabled SMT for a sandboxed node pool, SMT will remain manually enabled despite this issue.   ---   There is a misconfiguration with Simultaneous Multi-Threading (SMT), also known as Hyper-threading, on GKE Sandbox images. The misconfiguration leaves nodes potentially exposed to side channel attacks such as Microarchitectural Data Sampling (MDS) (for more context, see [GKE Sandbox documentation](/kubernetes-engine/docs/concepts/sandbox-pods#hyper-threading_is_disabled)). We do not recommend using the following affected versions:  * 1.22.4-gke.1501 * 1.22.6-gke.300 * 1.23.2-gke.300 * 1.23.3-gke.600  For instructions and more details, see the: [GKE security bulletin](/anthos/clusters/docs/security-bulletins#gcp-2022-011). | Medium |

Package        : protobuf
Version        : 3.6.1.3-2+deb10u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-22569 CVE-2021-22570 CVE-2022-1941

This update fixes a NULL pointer derference and two denial of service
conditions in in protobuf.

CVE-2021-22569

    An issue in protobuf-java allowed the interleaving of
    com.google.protobuf.UnknownFieldSet fields in such a way that would be
    processed out of order. A small malicious payload can occupy the parser for
    several minutes by creating large numbers of short-lived objects that cause
    frequent, repeated pauses.

CVE-2021-22570

    Nullptr dereference when a null char is present in a proto symbol. The
    symbol is parsed incorrectly, leading to an unchecked call into the proto
    file's name during generation of the resulting error message. Since the
    symbol is incorrectly parsed, the file is nullptr.

CVE-2022-1941

    A parsing vulnerability for the MessageSet type in the ProtocolBuffers can
    lead to out of memory failures. A specially crafted message with multiple
    key-value per elements creates parsing issues, and can lead to a Denial of
    Service against services receiving unsanitized input.

For Debian 10 buster, these problems have been fixed in version
3.6.1.3-2+deb10u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your protobuf packages.

For the detailed security status of protobuf please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/protobuf>
