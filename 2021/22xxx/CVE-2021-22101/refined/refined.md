Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-22101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in how the Cloud Controller handles REST HTTP requests with `label_selectors` on multiple V3 endpoints. Specifically, the processing of these requests leads to the generation of extremely large SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Unauthenticated Denial of Service (DoS): The system is susceptible to DoS attacks due to the inefficient processing of crafted requests.
- Inefficient SQL query generation: The application generates massive SQL queries when processing specific requests, causing the database to become unavailable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service: Attackers can cause the Cloud Controller's database (ccdb) to become unavailable, preventing legitimate users from accessing the system. This leads to a disruption of the overall service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- REST HTTP requests: Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to multiple V3 endpoints.
- `label_selectors`: The requests include `label_selectors` parameters which trigger the generation of the problematic SQL queries.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Unauthenticated access: The attacker does not need to authenticate to exploit this vulnerability. They can send the malicious requests from any network location reachable by the vulnerable Cloud Controller instance.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
- CAPI: All versions prior to 1.118.0
- CF Deployment: All versions prior to 16.24.0
