Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-22185:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way GitLab handles the author's name in wiki pages. Specifically, the application was using `html_safe` on a string that included the author's name, which could potentially contain user-supplied HTML. The author name is sourced from the Git commit.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. By injecting malicious HTML tags into the Git commit's author name, an attacker could cause arbitrary JavaScript code to execute in the context of a user's browser when they view the wiki page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the wiki page.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a Git commit with a malicious author name containing HTML tags (e.g., `<script>`). When the wiki page displays this author's name, the injected HTML is rendered by the browser, leading to the XSS execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to be able to make a commit to the GitLab repository where the wiki is stored. This suggests that the attacker would need contributor access to the repository.
