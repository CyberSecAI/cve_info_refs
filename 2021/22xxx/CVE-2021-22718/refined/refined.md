- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of a user-supplied path within the parsing of CBZ files, before using it in file operations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Directory traversal vulnerability due to insufficient validation of user-supplied paths.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation requires user interaction, such as visiting a malicious page or opening a malicious CBZ file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious CBZ file to the victim, or trick the victim into visiting a page with the exploit.
