{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that system hooks can be triggered by a GET request to the API endpoint `/api/v4/hooks/{hook-id}`. This allowed a CSRF attack because the action (triggering the hook) was performed via a GET request instead of a POST request.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause system hooks to be executed undesirably, potentially leading to unintended actions by the system.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Luring an administrator to browse a malicious website containing an image pointing to the vulnerable endpoint.",
      "Luring an administrator to click a link pointing to the vulnerable endpoint."
     ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to lure a logged-in GitLab administrator to visit a malicious site or click a malicious link. The attacker needs the hook ID to target a specific system hook."
  },
    "additional_notes": "The report suggests a fix by changing the HTTP method to POST to be consistent with a previous fix for a similar issue. This would prevent CSRF attacks by requiring a POST request, which cannot be as easily triggered by simply loading an image or following a link. The provided report indicates the vulnerability was reported in December 2018, however the CVE was not published until 2021"
