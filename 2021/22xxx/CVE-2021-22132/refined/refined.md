Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22132:

**1. Verification:**
The provided content directly relates to CVE-2021-22132. The title of the advisory is "CVE-2021-22132 Elasticsearch Vulnerability in NetApp Products," and the advisory clearly states that it addresses the mentioned CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies within the Elasticsearch software itself. Specifically, versions 7.7.0 through 7.10.1 are vulnerable due to an issue in the async search API that stores HTTP headers.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability is an information disclosure flaw present in the Elasticsearch async search API. The weakness is that HTTP headers are stored during the execution of an async search. This stored data can be accessed by other Elasticsearch users.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information contained within the stored HTTP request headers.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N), requires low access complexity (AC:L), and low privileges (PR:L) to exploit. The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N). The vulnerability exists in the async search API that stores HTTP headers which could be obtained from a different user.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be an Elasticsearch user within the cluster and have the ability to read the '.tasks' index. This user does not need special privileges beyond being able to access this index within the cluster.

**Additional Notes:**
- The content provides details about the affected Elasticsearch versions and the lack of a workaround, recommending an upgrade to Elasticsearch 7.10.2.
