- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A use-after-free vulnerability occurs when a module refers to memory that has already been freed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use-after-free vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to a module crash, which can compromise normal services.
- **Attack vectors**: Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending specific malicious messages to the affected module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to send specific messages to the vulnerable module.
