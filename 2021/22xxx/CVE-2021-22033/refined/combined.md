| vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 8.6 | 12 October 2021 | Build 18747913  Check for additions and updates to these release notes. |
| --- |

## What's in the Release Notes

The release notes cover the following topics:

* [What's New](#before)
* [Recommendations](#recommend)
* [Limitations](#limit)
* [Security Updates for Multiple Vulnerabilities](#cve)
* [Resolved Issues](#resolvedissues)
* [Known Issues](#knownissues)

## What's New

Here are the key features and capabilities of vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 8.6:

* Cloud Proxy deployment

* VCF enhancements

* Snapshot management enhancements

* Outbound notification integration

* vRealize Operations Manager support improvements

* Technical debt and product improvements

* Marketplace improvements
  + Previously, Marketplace connected with VMware Solutions Exchange to download content in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. VMware Solutions Exchange is now deprecated, so Marketplace fetches the required content from VMware Cloud Marketplace.

* Content Management enhancements
  + The version history is now captured for Orchestrator Action and Orchestrator-ConfigurationElement when capturing the Orchestrator workflow.
  + You can deploy or publish cloud templates and XaaSBlueprints when releasing these content types.

* vRealize Cloud Universal simplification to help our users

* Perpetual and vRealize Cloud Universal licenses in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager

Note: You can now provide customer feedback directly to the engineering and product development teams to address product improvement opportunities.

## Recommendations

* If the source vRealize Automation has 8.0.0 GA or 8.0.1 GA, ensure that KB [78235](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78235) is applied before upgrading to restore expired root accounts.
* When configuring multi-tenancy in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager for VMware Identity Manager and vRealize Automation, if you replace VMware Identity Manager certificate, it can cause service downtime on products integrated with VMware Identity Manager. Hence, it is suggested to create SAN certificates with required hostnames for multi-tenancy. To avoid service disruption, use wildcard certificates on VMware Identity Manager.
* To reboot VMware Identity Manager cluster setup, use the Power On and Power Off options in the VMware Identity Manager product actions in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager.

## Limitations

* vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager cannot be upgraded using VMware Remote console in Windows VM: During an vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager upgrade, the ISO filename is truncated after it is mounted in Windows VM. For an upgrade, ensure that you upload the ISO filename in a content library of the vCenter server or upload it to a datastore that the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager VM can access. After uploading the ISO filename, attach the ISO to the CD-ROM device of the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager VM by editing the hardware configuration from the vCenter inventory of the VM. From the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager UI, select CD-ROM based upgrade option, and then click proceed.

* vRealize Automation SaltStack Config cannot be downloaded from My VMware in the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Settings> Binary Mapping> Product Binaries page as the vRealize Automation SaltStack Config product binary is not available in the vRealize Suite download page. For more details and the workaround, refer to KB [82543](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/82543).

* If a custom form is released without a blueprint at the target vRealize Automation, even if the release is successful on vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, the custom form is not visible at the target vRealize Automation instance. To release a custom form, ensure that the associated composite blueprint is released or created first on the target vRealize Automation.

* Content source on vRealize Automation 8.x endpoint:When releasing a blueprint on vRealize Automation 8.x, you must create the content source on the target vRealize Automation 8.x prior to the release.

* vRealize Automation 8.x content types: The vRealize Automation 8.x content types which are renamed must be re-captured from the vRealize Automation endpoints, and then checked in to the source control endpoints. If the content is present in the source control, then you must manually rename the folder in the source control endpoints, and then check-out the content from the source control endpoints.

* Content Migration from 1.3, 2.0 and 2.1 are not supported in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 8.0.1 and later. For more information, see [Content Management.](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Suite-Lifecycle-Manager/8.1/com.vmware.vrsuite.lcm.8.1doc/GUID-CE092BF8-1B49-40EC-B213-CB5D68E46D1E.html)

* Support of content from an earlier version to the latest version depends on the product capabilities: You can capture content from vRealize Automation 7.5 and release to vRealize Automation 7.6. However, if vRealize Automation 7.6 does not support contents captured from older version, it would not work in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager.

* vRealize Orchestrator package can scale up to 1000 elements in a package.

* Snapshot for VMs remain in the in-progress state in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager: Snapshot for VMs that have device back up are not supported and remain in the in-progress state in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. You cannot take snapshots of VMs that have a device back up in vCenter. vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager also supports taking snapshots of VMs. However, the vCenter server also supports taking device back up. For such VMs, vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager snapshot requests would remain in progress.

* vRealize Operations upgrade failed at application upgrade task after completing the OS upgrade task and the cluster is not online:
   When Cassandra fails in one of the vRealize Operations nodes, this causes the vRealize Operations cluster to be offline.

## Resolved Issues

* **VCF Enabled Password Error After Upgrading vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager**

  When you upgrade from vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager version 8.2.1 to a later  version but prior to version 8.6, and then perform an inventory sync of the environment, you may not be able to edit passwords from Locker. You may receive the following error message:

  ```
  The Password edit is not allowed for VCF enabled environment
  ```

  **Workaround**: If you upgrade from vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager version 8.2.1 to a later version but prior to version 8.6.0, ensure that you reimport the environments of the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager inventory.
* **vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager user interface not accessible post upgrade**

  When upgrading vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, if VMware Identity Manager API does not respond, the upgrade fails with the following error:

  ```
  SYSOUT/SYSERR CAPTURED:  -- org.springframework.web.client.
  ResourceAccessException: I/O error on GET request for "https://[vIDM hostname]/SAAS/API/1.0/REST/auth/token":
  Connection reset; nested exception is java.net.SocketException: Connection reset”.
  This can be verified by looking at logs available under /var/log/vmware_vrlcm.log.
  ```

  **Workaround:**

  1. Revert snapshot.
  2. Ensure that VMware Identity Manager responds through vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager and the VMware Identity Manager inventory sync is successful, prior to an upgrade.

## Known Issues

* **vRealize Operations Manager patch install request fails with an error message**

  When the vRealize Operations Manager PAK file is corrupted in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, the vRealize Operations Manager patch install request may fail with the following error message:

  ```
  vROPS upgrade failure error with exception Product PAK file null not found.
  ```

  **Workaround**: Perform the following steps.

  1. Delete the vRealize Operations Manager patch install binary mapped in Settings > Binary Mappings > Patch Binary tab.
  2. Map the vRealize Operations Manager patch file with new binary.
  3. Retrigger the vRealize Operations Manager patch install.
* **Capturing historical content version VRO 7.5 is not supported**

  If we try to capture and release the historical version of the content from VRO 7.5, the content is not captured.

  **Workaround**: Use the supported version of the historical content from VRO 7.6 and later.
* **vRealize Operations deployment fails in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager**

  After you download the install binaries for vRealize Operations version 8.5 or 8.6 from My VMware in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, the
     installation of vRealize operations may fail with the following error.

  ```
  Error Code: LCMVSPHERECONFIG1000087
  Exception occurred while deploying ovf. Invalid argument provided.
  Invalid argument provided for ovf deployment.
  ```

  **Workaround:** Use alternate ways to map the install binary, such as Local or NFS, or enable the content library mapping.

  1. Download the vRealize Operations binaries from My VMware, and place it in a shared location, such as NFS or vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager VA.
  2. Navigate to Settings Page -> Binary Mapping in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager.
  3. To add a binary, select Local or NFS as Location Type in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager.
  4. Trigger the vRealize Operations installation.

  Note: See [vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Suite-Lifecycle-Manager/8.6/com.vmware.vrsuite.lcm.8.6.doc/GUID-2C93EB0A-055C-4897-A764-77FC73EFE992.html) for different ways in which binaries can be mapped in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager. You can also see [KB 86088](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/86088) for more details.
* **vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager and vRealize Log Insight integration error**

  If you attempt to integrate vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager and vRealize Log Insight without Secure Socket Layer (SSL), the integration may fail.

  Perform the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager and vRealize Log Insight integration with SSL.
* **Test connection for vRealize Operations Manager endpoint fails**

  When vRealize Operations Manager is configured with VMware Identity Manager using vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, if you perform a test connection in content management when adding the vRealize Operations Manager endpoint, the connection fails.

  **Workaround**: Log in with your username in the following format:

  ```
  domain@vidmauthsource
  For example; configadmin@System
  ```
* **vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager upgrade stops responding when downloading packages**

  When upgrading earlier versions of vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, the system upgrade stops responding, and the packages cannot be downloaded.

  **Workaround**:

  You can perform one of the following steps:

  + Revert snapshot, and then retry the upgrade.
  + Remove the upgradeprogress file, and then retry the upgrade.

  For more details, refer to [KB 81402](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/81402).
* **Compatibility version check takes longer time for content from source control**

  When performing tests from source control, such as apture+test, capture+deploy, capture+test+deploy or when releasing the content using multi-release or multiple tests functionalities, the version compatibility test using the compatibility check takes longer time when content is from source control.

  **Workaround**: Select fewer number of content from source control when performing the deployment, which will take lesser time to provide the result of compatible tests.
* **The retry inputs provided in the failed deployment request is not saved.**

  The retry inputs provided in the failed deployment request is not getting saved and the next task in the deployment request fails again with the old input provided during the deployment.

  **Workaround:** Provide the retry inputs for each failed task in the deployment request or you should to re-deploy the environment with correct inputs.
* **VRCS\_CUSTOM tagged workflow does not appear in the post and pre stub present under the Settings page.**

  None of the existing workflows appears in the drop-down (tagged with the VRCS\_CUSTOM ) post-selection of external vRO endpoint in the pre-post stub.

  **Workaround**: Rename the existing tag of the workflow (VRCS\_CUSTOM) in the vRO endpoint with "vRSLCM\_CUSTOM". This displays all the workflow in the drop-down menu.
* While migrating or upgrading content management, the source control endpoints are required to be mapped to the respective Source Control Servers again. While migrating vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 2.0 to 8.0.1 content library configuration in the vSphere setting page will not appear.

  **Workaround:**

  + Edit the required source control endpoint in the migrated or updated setup. Against the source control server, select the server from the drop-down menu which maps to this endpoint.
  + Similarly, if you are migrating from vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 2.0 to 8.0.1, reselect the content library from vSphere setting page within the Lifecycle Manager Environment.
* **When there are multiple vRealize Automation products selected during the tenant creation, if there is a failure in the tenant association with a particular vRealize Automation instance, then you cannot manage the entire tenant.**

  Tenant in the Tenant Management page cannot be used when the tenant is created in VMware Identity Manager but failed in vRealize Automation, and the same tenant cannot be used for other configurations.

  **Workaround:**

  Perform one of the following workarounds:

  1. Retry the failed tenant creation request after fixing the tenant creation failure.
  2. Skip the tenant creation for specific vRealize Automation, in the retry request.

  Retry for all products specified in the tenant creation request until the tenant creation request is successful. Once the create tenant request is successful, you can click the tenant in the Tenant Management page and perform further operations.
* **While replacing VMware Identity Manager certificate after the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager upgrade to 8.1 or above, the product associations does not list all products.**

  While replacing VMware Identity Manager certificate after vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager upgrade to 8.1 or above, the product associations does not list all products present in vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager that are integrated with VMware Identity Manager.

  **Workaround:**

  After the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager upgrade to 8.1 or above, run the inventory sync of the products that are integrated with VMware Identity Manager, and then try replacing the certificate in VMware Identity Manager to reflect all the product associations listed in Replace Certificate wizard.
* **The vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager UI crashes when navigating to certain pages.**

  The vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager UI crashes or does not reflect specific operations when navigating to certain pages. It displays an unexpected error message to check connectivity to the server and try again.

  **Workaround:**

  Perform one of the following workarounds:

  + Clear the browser cache.
  + Open the vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager UI in an incognito mode to reset the browser cache.

[Metrics added in vRealize Operations 8.6](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/85834)

**Instanced Metrics**

Instanced metrics are disabled by default after deploying or upgrading to vRealize Operations 8.2 or later, and after importing a policy from older versions. To re-enable instanced metrics in vRealize Operations 8.2 or later, see [KB 81119](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/81119).

**Updated Management Packs**

VMware Management Packs that are updated for vRealize Operations 8.6 are:

* SDDC Health Monitoring Solution 8.6
* vRealize Operations Management Pack for VMware Cloud Director 8.6
* vRealize Operations Tenant App for VMware Cloud Director 8.6
* vRealize Operations Management Pack for vRealize Orchestrator 3.2
* vRealize Operations Management Pack for Kubernetes 1.6

**VMware vRealize Operations Certificate Renewal PAK File**

An upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.6 also upgrades the internal certificate, except for setups with Cloud Proxy connected. The VMware vRealize Operations Certificate Renewal PAK file must be applied on vRealize Operations 8.6 only if the internal certificate has expired and if Cloud Proxy was connected to vRealize Operations before upgrade. The internal certificate in vRealize Operations 8.6 is generated during initial deployment. See [KB 71018](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/71018). Cloud Proxy certificates are upgraded separately, for more details, see [KB 83698](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/83698).

**Basic Authentication**

Basic authentication using the REST API is deprecated and disabled in vRealize Operations 8.6 fresh deployments by default. Instances that have been upgraded to vRealize Operations 8.6, will inherit the same properties before the upgrade. It is recommended that you use token-based authentication instead. If you still need to enable or disable basic authentication, see [KB 77271](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/77271).

**Active Directory Authentication Sources**

Logging in to vRealize Operations with a short name will be successful only if the user name's domain suffix matches the domain name specified in the **Base DN** option. Otherwise, the full user name with the domain suffix is required during login. For more information, see [KB 68131](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/68131)

## System Requirements

Review this section before you install or update vRealize Operations.

Sizing and Scaling

The CPU, memory, and disk requirements that meet the needs of a particular environment depend on the number and type of objects in your environment and data collected. This includes the number and type of adapters installed, the use of HA (High Availability) and CA (Continuous Availability), the duration of data retention, and the quantity of specific data points of interest. VMware updates [Knowledge Base article 2093783](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2093783) with the most current information about sizing and scaling. The Knowledge Base article includes overall maximums and spreadsheet calculations that provide a recommendation based on the number of objects and metrics you expect to monitor.

Deployment Formats

You can deploy vRealize Operations 8.6 with VMware virtual appliance.

If you are deploying a vRealize Operations virtual appliance and vRealize Operations Cloud Appliance, use a VMware vSphere Client to connect to a VMware vCenter Server, and deploy the virtual appliance through the vCenter Server instance. The vRealize Operations virtual appliance and vRealize Operations Cloud Appliance must be deployed on hosts that are:

* ESX/ESXi 6.5 Update 1 or later and managed by VMware vCenter Server 6.5 or later.
* If you have vRealize Operations virtual appliance deployed on ESXi 6.0 or older hosts, you must first upgrade vCenter Server and ESXi to version 6.5 Update 1 or later, and then upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.6.

## Hardware Versions and Cipher Suites and Protocols

**Hardware Versions**

The minimum hardware version required for vRealize Operations 8.x releases is version 11. If your vRealize Operations virtual appliance had a hardware version earlier than 11, you must first upgrade to hardware version 11 on vRealize Operations virtual appliance and then upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.6.

**Cipher Suites and Protocols**

For information about cipher suite lists and relevant protocols, see [Cipher Suites and Protocols](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations/8.6/com.vmware.vcom.scg.doc/GUID-171B7B96-4CF3-4803-94CE-2947AB646176.html).

## VMware Product Compatibility

VMware Product Compatibility

**Note:** The [VMware Product Interoperability Matrix](https://www.vmware.com/resources/compatibility/sim/interop_matrix.php) provides details about the compatibility of vRealize Operations with VMware products.

**Note:** For FIPS mode compatibility details, see the footnotes in the interoperability matrix. The product will not work in FIPS mode if there are footnotes that state that it will not work in FIPS mode.

## Solutions and Browser Support

Solutions Support

In addition to the VMware solutions (vSphere, vRealize Log Insight, vSAN, Service Discovery, NSX-T, and many more), see the [VMware Marketplace](https://marketplace.vmware.com/vsx/) for many more solutions. These solutions work with Virtual Appliance single or multiple nodes.

Browser Support

This vRealize Operations release supports all current Web browsers, although only the following browsers were tested with this release:

* Google Chrome: Version 91 and 92
* Mozilla Firefox: Version 90 and 91
* Microsoft Edge: Version 91 and 92
* Safari: 13 and 14

**Note:** Support for Internet Explorer has been dropped from vRealize Operations 8.4 onwards.

## SDDC Compliance

To ensure compliance of your vSphere, VMware Cloud on AWS, and vSAN 7.0, 6.7, and 6.5 objects, and also NSX-T 2.3, 2.4, and 2.5, and NSX-V 6.3.x and 6.4.x objects, vRealize Operations 8.6 includes compliance alerts for [VMware vSphere Security Configuration Guides versions 6.7 Update 1 and 6.5](https://www.vmware.com/security/hardening-guides.html). These security configuration guide alerts are based on the corresponding object types. Some of the alerts and symptoms are available only for backward compatibility with older versions of vSphere, even though the current release supports the latest vSphere Security Configuration Guide 6.7 Update 1.

**Note**: Compliance rules will work on vSphere 7.0 objects as well. However, those rules are based on vSphere Security Configuration Guide 6.7 Update 1.

## Installing and Upgrading vRealize Operations

**Upgrading to vRealize Operations 8.6, resets out-of-the-box content as part of the software upgrade process. This implies that the user modifications made to default content such as alert definitions, symptom definitions, recommendations, policies, views, dashboards, widgets, and reports are overwritten. You need to clone or backup the content before you upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.6.**

There are two different upgrade .pak files to upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.6:

* To upgrade from vRealize Operations 8.x to 8.6 without Cloud Proxy, you must download and apply the **vRealize Operations Manager - Virtual Appliance upgrade** .pak file without Cloud Proxy.
* To upgrade from vRealize Operations 8.x to 8.6 with Cloud Proxy, you must download and apply the **vRealize Operations Manager - Virtual Appliance upgrade** .pak file with Cloud Proxy

**Notes:**

* Direct upgrade from vRealize Operations 7.5 to vRealize Operations 8.6 is not supported.
* While upgrading to vRealize Operations 8.6, the expected size of the /dev/sda for Photon OS is 20 GB (hard disk 1). For information about this requirement, see [KB 75298](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/75298).
* To upgrade to vRealize Operations 8.6, you must upload the upgrade .pak file to the Master node only. Uploading it to any other node will result in a failed upgrade.
* It is always recommended to run the Pre-Upgrade Assessment tool before an upgrade. A pre-upgrade assessment report that is generated will provide you with the recommended replacements. This tool provides you with an impact analysis following the reduction of metrics in various versions of the product. For more details on using the Pre-Upgrade Assessment Tool, see [KB 85833](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/85833).

* [User Interface Issues](#Known Issues-User Interface Issues)

### Installation and Upgrade Issues

* **VMware Cloud on AWS Government Cloud**

  When you restart or upgrade cloud proxy, reconfigure the parameter values in the VMware Cloud on AWS and NSX-T Adapter configuration files.

  **Workaround:** See the [Prerequisites](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations/8.6/com.vmware.vcom.core.doc/GUID-297BFD57-FD7C-427A-8EBE-9789CF0ED1F8.html) section in the documentation for the details of parameters and values.
* **After you upgrade vRealize Operations from 8.4 to a later release, content upgrade and agent management actions fail**

  After you upgrade vRealize Operations from a previous release, content upgrade and agent management actions fail on vRealize Operations on-prem and vRealize Operations Cloud when you also upgrade cloud proxy.

  **Workaround:**

  Complete the following steps:

  1. SSH to the Cloud Proxy VM.
  2. Run the following command: */rpm-content/ucp/subsequentboot.sh*

  You can view the log from the following location: */opt/vmware/var/log/ucp-subsequentboot*
* **Upgrade might fail if any of the nodes are running on VMs with US/Pacific-New timezone**

  PostgreSQL database systems no longer support the US/Pacific-New timezone, which was just an alias for America/Los\_Angeles timezone. If any of the vRealize Operations nodes are running on VMs with US/Pacific-New timezone, upgrade might fail.

  **Workaround:** Change VM timezones from US/Pacific-New to America/Los\_Angeles, and then upgrade.
* **The Take Node(s) Offline wizard appears when you try to bring an offline RC node online**

  When you try to bring an RC node back online after having just taken it offline, the **Take Node(s) Offline** wizard appears when you click the **Take Node Offline/Online** button, instead of the **Take Node(s) Online** wizard as expected.

  **Workaround:** If the node state still displays as **Running** or the status is still **Online** after having taken it offline, wait a few moments and then manually refresh the data in the view from the top menu to get the latest state of the node. After the correct state is displayed which is **Not Running**, the **Take Node Offline/Online** button will work as expected.

### General Issues

* **Renaming the VMware Cloud on AWS cluster**

  If a cluster is renamed in VMware Cloud on AWS, and as a result of renaming the cluster, if the management resource pool names change in VMware Cloud on AWS, then the following limitations are seen in vRealize Operations:

  + The view, "VMC Management Resource Pool" and the dashboard, "VMC Management VM Monitoring" excludes the management resource pool objects from the cluster that was renamed. As a workaround, update the filter definition for the view "VMC Management Resource Pool" to use a "contains" constraint instead of an "is" constraint for the name attribute that matches the value of "Mgmt-ResourcePool".
  + Jobs that are run through Automation Central will include the VMware Cloud on AWS management VMs instead of excluding them. Use caution with jobs as they may cause interruptions in the management VM functionality in VMware Cloud on AWS.
* **JBoss server running in domain mode does not support LCM using custom Telegraf**

  You cannot deploy jolokia.war across all the servers that run as a part of the JBoss domain mode and hence metrics cannot be collected.

  **Workaround:** Monitoring domain mode configuration in JBoss is supported in open source Telegraf. You can deploy jolokia.war across multiple servers.
* **The Add button in the Manage Telegraf Agents page remains activated after the creation of an application service**

  While monitoring specific application services using Telegraf, the Add button in the Manage Telegraf Agents page is active after the creation of the second instance of the following application services: MSIIS, Active Directory, Sharepoint, MSExchange, and Network Time Protocol.

  **Workaround:** Delete the previous configurations of the specific application services and configure a new one.
* **Concurrent activation or deactivation of plugins during application monitoring using suite-api does not work**

  During application monitoring using suite-api, when you activate or deactivate plugins concurrently, plugin activation or deactivation does not work. An exception is logged in the ucpapi.log file.

  **Workaround:** Provide a gap of one second between each thread during activation or deactivation of the plugins using suite-api.
* **When you get an application instance's configuration status using a Rest-API call, a wrong status is returned when the same configuration was installed or uninstalled previously**

  If you installed or uninstalled an application instance and then uninstalled or installed it respectively, the API returns "SUBMITTING" when you try to get the application instance install or uninstall configuration status using "GET /api/applications/agents/services/{taskId}/status".

  **Workaround:** While getting the application instance configuration status using the "GET /api/applications/agents/services/{taskId}/status" API, ensure that you use the latest performed task ID. The result of calls with older IDs is undefined.
* **Previewing a view works incorrectly**

  When you try to preview a view that was not opened recently, the preview is not displayed.

  **Workaround:** Click on **Sample Data** and then anywhere on the screen to view the preview. Refresh your browser tab afterwards, so that the workaround is applicable to other views from the left pane, which do not have a specified preview source.
* **When you upgrade from vRealize Operations 8.1 to 8.6, the Cassandra application service is displayed as Java Application in the Services Discovered/Configured column of the Manage Telegraf Agents tab**

  During application monitoring, after you upgrade from vRealize Operations 8.1 to 8.6, the Cassandra application service is displayed as Java Application in the Services Discovered/Configured column of the Manage Telegraf Agents tab. This happens if the Cassandra application service is configured for monitoring in vRealize Operations 8.1, using the vRealize Application Remote Collector generic Java plugin.

  **Workaround:** Deactivate the Java plugin before you upgrade the vRealize Application Remote Collector agent on the VM. After upgrading the vRealize Application Remote Collector agent, the Cassandra plugin will be discovered and can then be activated.
* **System language settings affects service discovery**

  Service discovery might not work if the system language is different from English. For languages different from English, network connection state values might be different from constants defined in standard RFCs.

  **Workaround:** None
* **Reconfigure the Project Price widget if the vRealize Automation 8.x integration is deactivated and then reactivated**

  There is data missing in the **Project Price** widget of the **Cloud Automation Project Price Overview** dashboard when you deactivate and then reactivate an existing vRealize Automation 8.x integration.

  **Workaround:** Reconfigure the **Project Price** widget by completing the following steps:

  1. After you deactivate and then reactivate the vRealize Automation 8.x integration, navigate to **Dashboards** > **vRealize Automation 8.x** > **Cloud Automation Project Price Overview** dashboard.
  2. Edit the **Project Price** widget.
  3. Navigate to the **Input data** section.
  4. Select the **'+' (Add Object)** button and select the CAS World object from **vRealize Automation Adapter 8.x > CAS World**.
  5. Click **OK**.
  6. Navigate to the **Output data** in the same widget configuration mode. Search for and select the CAS Project Price View object from the list.
  7. Save the widget.
* **While monitoring applications, you cannot activate a plugin with the same fields till the plugin configuration is deleted**

  An error message is displayed in the user interface of vRealize Operations that states the following: 'Failed to update resource: Resource with same key already exists'.

  **Workaround:** Manually delete the existing plugin configuration and then continue with the activation of the plugin. If the problem persists, delete the corresponding resource from the inventory.
* **Alerts from the vSAN adapter that correspond to vSAN health check tests are not canceled if the test is removed from the vSAN Health Service.**

  vRealize Operations cannot detect and cancel deleted alerts.

  **Workaround**: Manually cancel the alert from the user interface of vRealize Operations.
* **Generated reports may be blank**

  If you log in to vRealize Operations with vCenter Server credentials and generate a report, the generated report is always blank.

  **Workaround:** None
* **Despite deleting ucp-adapter instance certificates, users can run actions**

  If users delete ucp-adapter instance certificates, they can still run actions such as, start and stop an agent, configure remote checks, and so on.

  **Workaround:** None
* **If you change the vRealize Operations web certificate, some adapter instances may stop collection**

  Some adapter instances might stop collection after an update of the web certificate via API or from the vRealize Operations admin user interface.

  **Workaround:** Stop and start the impacted adapters.
* **Sorting by name in a view, results in unexpected behavior**

  When you edit a view and sort by name, the number of virtual machines displayed is more than what is configured.

  **Workaround:** None
* **HTTP Post Adapter is deprecated in vRealize Operations 7.0 and above**

  Re-enabling the HTTP Post Adapter can open vRealize Operations to security flaws.

  **Workaround**: Complete the steps in [KB 60328](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/60328).
* **The compliance score for a user with limited object visibility is the same as for a user with complete object visibility**

  The compliance score is calculated for objects that are not visible (not assigned) to the current user.

  **Workaround:** Complete the following steps:

  1. Create a custom group with objects visible (assigned) to the user.
  2. For that group, apply a policy in which the needed set of compliance alert definitions is enabled.

     If that set is enabled only in one active policy (the one that is applied to the custom group), the compliance benchmark based on those alert definitions will display the correct score.

### User Interface Issues

* **After upgrading cloud proxy and vRealize Operations to 8.6, the VM name is not appended to the MSSQL instance**

  After upgrading cloud proxy and vRealize Operations to 8.6, the VM name is not appended to the MSSQL instance for existing or newly activated plugins.

  **Workaround**: None
* **The Last Year option in the date picker is not intuitive**

  The Last Year option in the date picker indicates that the time range starts from the end of the previous month and goes back a year. It does not indicate a time range that spans one year from the current date or the whole previous year.

  **Workaround**: None
* **A PDF report file might not include all data from a widget that has a scrollbar**

  When you generate a report that contains a custom dashboard with a widget that has a scrollbar, the downloaded PDF file might not include all the data in the widget.

  **Workaround:** Increase the height of the widget in the dashboard to fit all the data.
