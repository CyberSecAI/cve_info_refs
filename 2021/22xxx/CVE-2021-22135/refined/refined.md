Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22135:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the Elasticsearch suggester and profile API. Specifically, when Document and Field Level Security are enabled, certain queries can inadvertently enable the profiler and suggester. This bypasses the intended access controls that should disable these APIs when document-level security is in use.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is an information disclosure flaw. The suggester and profile API, when improperly enabled, can reveal the existence of documents and fields that the attacker should not have permission to view based on the security configurations.
- **Bypass of Document and Field Level Security:** The vulnerability allows attackers to bypass the intended security restrictions imposed by Document and Field Level Security, which are designed to control access to sensitive data within Elasticsearch.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Disclosure of Sensitive Information:** Attackers can gain unauthorized access to the existence of documents and fields that should be protected by security configurations. This could lead to the revelation of sensitive information, depending on the data contained within the Elasticsearch instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through specifically crafted queries that can enable the suggester and profiler APIs even when they should be disabled by document-level security.
- This indicates the attack is likely network-based (AV:N), involving crafted queries sent to the vulnerable Elasticsearch instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privileges (PR:L):** The attacker needs to have a user account that has access to send requests to the vulnerable Elasticsearch instance. They do not necessarily need high privileges, just enough to interact with the API.
- **Complex Query Construction:** The attacker must craft a specific query that triggers the vulnerability. This implies a level of technical sophistication in understanding how Elasticsearch query mechanisms work.
- **No User Interaction (UI:N):** The attack doesn't require any user interaction beyond sending the crafted query.
- **No Scope Change (S:U):** The security scope remains unchanged

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided CVSS score from the Elasticsearch security advisory (3.1) is different from the NetApp security advisory (5.3), likely due to different calculations or contexts.
- The advisory from NetApp indicates that their products are not affected by this vulnerability.
- There is no known workaround for this flaw, and users are advised to upgrade to the specified versions of Elasticsearch.
