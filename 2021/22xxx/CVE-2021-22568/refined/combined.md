# Publishing to third-party package repositories may expose pub.dev credentials

Moderate

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<2.15.0

## Patched versions

2.15.0

## Description

### Impact

A malicious *third-party package repository* may impersonate a user on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) for up to one hour after the user has published a package to that third-party package repository using `dart pub publish`.

When publishing Dart packages to third-party package repositories using `dart pub publish`, Dart SDKs prior to `2.15.0` will authorize the request using an OAuth2 `access_token` intended for authentication with [pub.dev](https://pub.dev). Thus, a malicious third-party package repository could use this `access_token` to impersonate the user on [pub.dev](https://pub.dev). The `access_token` is usually only valid for up to one hour, but an attacker could persist access by using the `access_token` to obtain uploader permissions.

This only affects users who publish packages to a third-party package repository by:

1. Specifying `publish_to: https://my-pub-server.com/` in `pubspec.yaml` and publishing using `dart pub publish`;
2. Defining environment variable `PUB_HOSTED_URL=https://my-pub-server.com/` and publishing using `dart pub publish`; or;
3. Publishing using `dart pub publish --server https://my-pub-server.com/`.

### Patches

This is fixed as of Dart SDK version `2.15.0`.

As of Dart SDK version `2.15.0` requests to third-party package repositories will no longer include an OAuth2 `access_token` intended for [pub.dev](https://pub.dev). Requests to third-party package repositories can be authenticated using opaque tokens passed to the Dart SDK using `dart pub token add https://my-pub-server.com`.

### Workarounds

Avoid publishing to untrusted third-party package repositories with `dart pub publish` using a Dart SDK prior to `2.15.0`.

### Mitigations

If you've published a package to a third-party package repository, consider doing an audit of all your account activity on the [pub.dev](https://pub.dev) public package repository. You can use the pub.dev [activity log](https://pub.dev/my-activity-log) for this.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
