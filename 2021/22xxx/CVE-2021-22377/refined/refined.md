Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input verification in a module of Huawei products.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability.
* **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can inject commands, potentially compromising normal service.
* **Attack vectors:** Sending malicious parameters to the affected module.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attackers need to log onto the affected module.

**Summary:** The vulnerability lies in a lack of proper input sanitization in a module of certain Huawei products. This allows an attacker, who has already authenticated onto the device, to inject malicious commands by sending crafted parameters to the vulnerable module. This command injection can lead to the compromise of normal device operation.

**Affected Products:**
- S12700
- S2700
- S5700
- S6700
- S7700

**Affected Versions:** V200R019C00SPC500 for all listed products.

**Fixed Versions:**
