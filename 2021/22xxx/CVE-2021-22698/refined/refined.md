Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper parsing of SSD files within the Schneider Electric EcoStruxure Power Build software. Specifically, the software fails to validate the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a fixed-size stack-based buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Unrestricted Upload of File with Dangerous Type (CWE-434):** The software allows uploading of files with a dangerous type (SSD), without proper validation, leading to further exploitation.
*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow:** Due to insufficient length validation, a specially crafted SSD file with oversized data can overflow the buffer allocated on the stack.
* **Use-After-Free:** The improper parsing of a malicious SSD file could also lead to use-after-free condition

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process running the vulnerable software.
*   **System Compromise:**  The attacker can potentially gain full control of the system running the software.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious SSD File:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious SSD file crafted to exploit the buffer overflow vulnerability.
* **User Interaction:** The user needs to open a malicious file for the exploit to be triggered.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local Access:** The attack requires local access, or ability to get a user to open the file.
*   **Low Skill Level:** The advisory notes that the exploit has a low skill level requirement.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in EcoStruxure Power Build-Rapsody software versions 2.1.13 and prior.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 7.8, with a vector string of AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates that the vulnerability has high impacts on confidentiality, integrity, and availability, and requires user interaction.
*   A fix is expected in the first half of 2021.
*   Mitigation includes: limiting access, using application whitelisting, and up-to-date antivirus software.
*   The vulnerability was reported by rgod, working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative to CISA.
*   Affected sectors: Commercial Facilities, Energy, Food and Agriculture, Government Facilities, Transportation Systems, Water and Wastewater Systems
