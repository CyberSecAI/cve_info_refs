- **Root cause of vulnerability:** CSV injection vulnerability in the interactive analytics export function of VMware vRealize Log Insight.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of user-supplied data during the export of CSV files. This allows an attacker to inject malicious content into the exported CSV file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious user can embed untrusted data into a CSV file through Log Insight's export function. When the victim opens this malicious CSV file, the injected code might get executed within their environment, potentially leading to data compromise, information disclosure, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the interactive analytics export function.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be authenticated with non-administrative privileges to export a CSV file with injected code. The user also needs to open the crafted CSV file to trigger the payload.
