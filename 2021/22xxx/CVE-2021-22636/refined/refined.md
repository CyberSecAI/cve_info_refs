Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22636:

**Verification:**

The CISA advisory specifically mentions CVE-2021-22636 under section 4.2.18:
"Texas Instruments TI-RTOS returns a valid pointer to a small buffer on extremely large values, which can trigger an integer overflow vulnerability in 'malloc' and result in code execution." This aligns with the CVE description for CVE-2021-22636.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Integer overflow in the `malloc` function within Texas Instruments TI-RTOS. The vulnerability occurs when allocating an extremely large memory request which can trigger an integer overflow causing `malloc` to allocate a much smaller buffer but return a valid pointer.
*   **Weakness:** Integer overflow vulnerability in memory allocation functions.
*   **Impact:** This can lead to arbitrary memory allocation, which in turn can cause code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Local access with high complexity.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs local access to the device, and the exploit requires a high degree of complexity.

**Additional Information:**

*   The CISA advisory provides a broader context, grouping this vulnerability with similar integer overflow issues in other Real-Time Operating Systems (RTOS) and libraries.
*   The advisory also provides remediation steps, which involves updating TI-RTOS to patched versions.
*   The advisory uses a CVSS v3 base score of 7.4 for this specific vulnerability, with the vector string: AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
