## Description

For certain valid JPEG XL images with a size slightly larger than an integer number of groups (256x256 pixels) when processing the groups out of order the decoder can perform an out of bounds copy of image pixels from an image buffer in the heap to another. This copy can occur when processing the right or bottom edges of the image, but only when groups are processed in certain order. Groups can be processed out of order in multi-threaded decoding environments with heavy thread load but also with images that contain the groups in an arbitrary order in the file. It is recommended to upgrade past 0.6.0 or patch with [libjxl/libjxl#775](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/pull/775)

### @deymo **[deymo](/deymo)** commented [Oct 26, 2021](#issue-1036599090)

When processing groups out of order with an image where the last group

size is smaller than the needed border it was possible to attempt to

load the right or bottom border from the next group when already

processing the rightmost or bottom group respectively. This situation

was causing an out-of-bounds copy on saved Image3F buffer in release

mode (or hitting a JXL\_DASSERT in debug mode).

The order in which the groups are processed depends on many factors,

including the order in which the threads are scheduled when using

multiple threads, and potentially the order of the groups in the file

(not checked).

Added a test to force the out-of-order situation in a simulated parallel

runner that forces a random order on the tasks. The new test triggers

the assert in debug mode, which is now fixed.

Fixes [#708](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/issues/708).

Sorry, something went wrong.

`[Fix out of bounds copy in LoadBorders() (](/deymo/libjxl/commit/435f2acd4f9215d13d752c084f6e571c13a588cd "Fix out of bounds copy in LoadBorders() (#775)

When processing groups out of order with an image where the last group
size  is smaller than the needed border it was possible to attempt to
load the right or bottom border from the next group when already
processing the rightmost or bottom group respectively. This situation
was causing an out-of-bounds copy on saved Image3F buffer in release
mode (or hitting a JXL_DASSERT in debug mode).

The order in which the groups are processed depends on many factors,
including the order in which the threads are scheduled when using
multiple threads, and potentially the order of the groups in the file
(not checked).

Added a test to force the out-of-order situation in a simulated parallel
runner that forces a random order on the tasks. The new test triggers
the assert in debug mode, which is now fixed.

Fixes #708.

Each thread have different instance of the plug-in and each plug-in create own ParallelRunner. It may not crash during first iteration, but sooner or later it crashes. The output may run like this:  ``` ./test_crash Iteration: 0 [0]     10916x9985      count:1 [1]     10916x9985      count:1 Iteration: 1 [0]     10916x9985      count:1 [1]     10916x9985      count:1 Iteration: 2 [1]     10916x9985      count:1 /var/tmp/portage/media-libs/libjxl-9999/work/libjxl-9999/lib/jxl/image_ops.h:48: JXL_DASSERT: rect_from.IsInside(from) Neprípustná inštrukcia  ```  Sometime it crashes immediately:  ``` Iteration: 0 /var/tmp/portage/media-libs/libjxl-9999/work/libjxl-9999/lib/jxl/image_ops.h:48: JXL_DASSERT: rect_from.IsInside(from) /var/tmp/portage/media-libs/libjxl-9999/work/libjxl-9999/lib/jxl/image_ops.h:48: JXL_DASSERT: rect_from.IsInside(from) Neprípustná inštrukcia  ```  When just one thread with plug-in is running at a time, there is no crash. |

| I am able to reproduce the crash also via [gdk-pixbuf](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/tree/main/plugins/gdk-pixbuf) loader which use ResizeableParallelRunner.  It is enough to call following procedure in concurrently in multiple threads few times:  ``` #include <gdk-pixbuf/gdk-pixbuf.h>  bool test_plugin_gdk(int id) {     GdkPixbuf *pixbuf = gdk_pixbuf_new_from_file("bucuresti2.jxl", NULL);     if (!pixbuf) {         printf("Error reading picture via GDK plugin\n");         return false;     }     int x = gdk_pixbuf_get_width(pixbuf);     int y = gdk_pixbuf_get_height(pixbuf);     printf("GDK [%d]\t%dx%d\n", id, x, y);     gdk_pixbuf_unref(pixbuf);     return true; }  ``` |

| [@novomesk](https://github.com/novomesk) what's the source image for that .jxl file? Does it have a vertical green rectangle on the top right corner of the image by any chance? I'm not sure if that rectangle was on the source image or that's also a (maybe different) bug.  I wasn't able to reproduce it directly with djxl but it has to do with the order in which the groups are processed so the more threads/CPUs you have the more likely it is. I was able to reliably reproduce it with an random-order single threaded parallel runner. |

`[Fix out of bounds copy in LoadBorders()](/deymo/libjxl/commit/279a2e6dbea872d2a071588a7c4c62d771907ab1 "Fix out of bounds copy in LoadBorders()

When processing groups out of order with an image where the last group
size  is smaller than the needed border it was possible to attempt to
load the right or bottom border from the next group when already
processing the rightmost or bottom group respectively. This situation
was causing an out-of-bounds copy on saved Image3F buffer in release
mode (or hitting a JXL_DASSERT in debug mode).

The order in which the groups are processed depends on many factors,
including the order in which the threads are scheduled when using
multiple threads, and potentially the order of the groups in the file
(not checked).

Added a test to force the out-of-order situation in a simulated parallel
runner that forces a random order on the tasks. The new test triggers
the assert in debug mode, which is now fixed.

`[Fix out of bounds copy in LoadBorders() (](/libjxl/libjxl/commit/e6497057899269bb40f54a26729826a55d857fd7 "Fix out of bounds copy in LoadBorders() (#775)

When processing groups out of order with an image where the last group
size  is smaller than the needed border it was possible to attempt to
load the right or bottom border from the next group when already
processing the rightmost or bottom group respectively. This situation
was causing an out-of-bounds copy on saved Image3F buffer in release
mode (or hitting a JXL_DASSERT in debug mode).

The order in which the groups are processed depends on many factors,
including the order in which the threads are scheduled when using
multiple threads, and potentially the order of the groups in the file
(not checked).

Added a test to force the out-of-order situation in a simulated parallel
runner that forces a random order on the tasks. The new test triggers
the assert in debug mode, which is now fixed.
