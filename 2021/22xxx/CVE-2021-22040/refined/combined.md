## Upgrade Information

You can upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11 either from VMware Cloud Foundation 3.10.2.2 (sequential upgrade) or from VMware Cloud Foundation 3.7.1 or later (skip-level upgrade). VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11 cannot be deployed as a new release. For upgrade information, refer to the [*VMware Cloud Foundation Upgrade Guide*](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/3.11/vcf-lifecycle/GUID-B384B08D-3652-45E2-8AA9-AF53066F5F70.html).

VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11 is supported as a source version for migration to VMware Cloud Foundation 4.x.

**vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Version 2.1.0 Patch 3**

There is no upgrade bundle for vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Version 2.1.0 Patch 3. To upgrade, follow the process described in the [VMware vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager 2.1 Patch 3 Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vRealize-Suite-Lifecycle-Manager/2.1/rn/VMware-vRealize-Suite-Lifecycle-Manager-21-Patch-3-Release-Notes.html).

**Design Considerations for Multiple Availability Zones**

NSX-T Data Center 3.x changes how the northbound traffic flow can be influenced. If you have the following architecture, you must change the Tier-0 gateway architecture **before** you upgrade to NSX-T Data Center 3.x:

* An NSX Edge cluster with edge nodes placed in both availability zones (typically two edge nodes pinned to Availability Zone 1 and two edge nodes pinned to Availability Zone 2)
* An Active/Active Tier-0 gateway architecture where the Tier-0 gateway spans edge nodes in both availability zones.
* Deployed in a data center infrastructure that cannot tolerate asymmetrical routing to or from each availability zone, for example, for physical data center firewalls, and other.

Change to a Tier-0 gateway architecture where the Tier-0 gateway is active only in a single availability zone at a time in one of the following ways:

* **Recommended**: Place an NSX Edge cluster with edge nodes in a single availability zone only (typically Availability Zone 1), that fail over using vSphere HA to Availability Zone 2 on failure. This change requires changes in the data center fabric including stretching of the Uplink and Edge TEP VLANs between the availability zones. See [KB 87426](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87426) for more information.
* Migrate to an Active/Standby Tier-0 gateway. Follow the [NSX-T Data Center 3.x product documentation](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-NSX-T-Data-Center/index.html) for changing from an Active/Active to an Active/Standby architecture of the Tier-0 gateway.

**Changing from a Three N-VDS to Single N-VDS Edge Node Design**

Starting with NSX-T Data Center 2.5, a single N-VDS switch design is available in the NSX Edge node. Changing from three N-VDS instances to a single N-VDS provides network throughput and scalability improvements in NSX-T Data Center. It is recommended for all environments but highly recommended for environments deployed at scale.

The procedure involves the following high-level steps:

* Deploy a new NSX Edge cluster with new edge nodes based on the single N-VDS design.
* Deploy a new Tier-0 gateway and verify connectivity.
* Once tested, you can reconfigure your Tier-1 gateways to utilize the new Tier-0 gateway on the single N-VDS edge cluster.

See [KB 87426](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87426) for more information.

## VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11.0.1 Release Information

You can upgrade to VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11.0.1 either from VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11 (sequential upgrade) or from VMware Cloud Foundation 3.7.1 or later (skip-level upgrade). VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11.0.1 cannot be deployed as a new release. For upgrade information, refer to the VMware Cloud Foundation Upgrade Guide. It is strongly recommended that all customers on VCF 3.x upgrade to VCF 3.11.0.1.

VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11.0.1 contains the following BOM updates:

| Software Component | Version | Date | Build Number |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SDDC Manager | 3.11.0.1 | 07 APR 2022 | 19571759 |
| VMware NSX Data Center for vSphere | 6.4.13 | 08 FEB 2022 | 19307994 |

SDDC Manager 3.11.0.1 fixes the issue:

* Deleting an NSX for vSphere (NSX-V) VI workload domain incorrectly deletes the NSX controllers for the management domain

VMware NSX Data Center for vSphere 6.4.13 addresses the security vulnerability described in [VMSA-2022-0005](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0005.html)

### Upgrade Known Issues

* **File permissions precheck gets stuck or captures permission issues in wrong directories**

  There are two potential issues:

  + The LCM directories permission precheck does not finish for more than an hour.
  + The LCM directories permission precheck reports permission/ownership issues in `/var/log` directories.

  Workaround: See [KB 90205](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/90205).
* **Upgrade precheck fails for PSC SSO**

  If the maximum lifetime password policy for vCenter Single Sign-On local accounts is set to a number greater than 9999, then the upgrade precheck fails.

  Workaround: Set the maximum lifetime password policy to any number less than or equal to 9999. See [KB 88163](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88163) for more information.
* **There is a cosmetic mismatch between the posted manifest date (02/11/2022) and the release notes software date (02/14/2022).**

  There are no technical side effects.
* **The vRealize Automation upgrade reports the "Precheck Execution Failure : Make sure the latest version of VMware Tools is installed" message**

  The vRealize Automation IaaS VMs must have the same version of VMware Tools as the ESXi hosts on which the VMs reside.

  Workaround: Upgrade VMware Tools on the vRealize Automation IaaS VMs.
* **Error upgrading vRealize Automation**

  Under certain circumstances, upgrading vRealize Automation may fail with a message similar to:

  ```
  An automated upgrade has failed. Manual intervention is required.
  vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager Pre-upgrade checks for vRealize Automation have failed:
  vRealize Automation Validations : iaasms1.rainpole.local : RebootPending : Check if reboot is pending : Reboot the machine.
  vRealize Automation Validations : iaasms2.rainpole.local : RebootPending : Check if reboot is pending : Reboot the machine.
  Please retry the upgrade once the upgrade is available again.
  ```

  1. Log-in into the first VM listed in the error message using RDP or the VMware Remote Console.
  2. Reboot the VM.
  3. Wait 5 minutes after the login screen of the VM appears.
  4. Repeat steps 1-3 for the next VM listed in the error message.
  5. Once you have restarted all the VMs listed in the error message, retry the vRealize Automation upgrade.
* **When there is no associated workload domain to vRealize Automation, the VRA VM NODES CONSISTENCY CHECK upgrade precheck fails**

  This upgrade precheck compares the content in the logical inventory on the SDDC Manager and the content in the vRealize Lifecycle Manager environment. When there is no associated workload domain, the vRealize Lifecycle Manager environment does not contain information about the `iaasagent1.rainpole.local` and `iaasagent2.rainpole.local` nodes. Therefore the check fails.

  Workaround: None. You can safely ignore a failed `VRA VM NODES CONSISTENCY CHECK` during the upgrade precheck. The upgrade will succeed even with this error.
* **NSX Data Center for vSphere upgrade fails with the message "Host Prep remediation failed"**

  After addressing the issue, the NSX Data Center for vSphere bundle no longer appears as an available update.

  Workaround: To complete the upgrade, manually enable the anti-affinity rules.

  1. Log in to the management vCenter Server using the vSphere Client.
  2. Click **Menu > Hosts and Clusters** and select the cluster on which host prep remediation failed (for example SDDC-Cluster1).
  3. Click **Configure > Configuration > VM/Host Rules**.
  4. Select **NSX Controller Anti-Affinity Rule** and click **Edit**.
  5. Select **Enable rule** and click **OK**.

  This completes the NSX Data Center for vSphere upgrade.
* **Upgrade precheck may fail as you approach the maximum number of supported ESXi hosts**

  In a large environment with many ESXi hosts, vSAN prechecks may fail.

  Workaround: Turn off vSAN prechecks.

  1. SSH to the SDDC Manager appliance as the **vcf** user.
  2. Enter `su` to switch to the root user.
  3. Turn off the vSAN prechecks:

     + Enter `vi /opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application-prod.properties`
     + In the VSAN CONFIGURATION section, set the following properties to false:
     + `vsan.healthcheck.enabled=false`
     + `vsan.hcl.update.enabled=false`
     + `vsan.precheck.enabled=false`
     + Save the changes.
  4. Restart LCM.

     `systemctl restart lcm`
* **Task panel does not show correct upgrade tasks for NSX-T workload domain upgrades**

  When you upgrade NSX-T workload domains. the task panel does not show upgrade status correctly. This is a UI issue only and there is no impact on the upgrade workflow.

  Workaround: Monitor upgrade status by navigating to the Update/Patches tab of the relevant workload domain:

  1. On the SDDC Manager Dashboard, click *Inventory* -> *Workload Domains*.
  2. In the Domain column, click the appropriate workload domain name.
  3. Click the *Update/Patches* tab.
  4. Monitor upgrade status.
* **Exception displayed when a scheduled NSX-T upgrade begins during an idle SDDC Manager session**

  When a scheduled NSX-T upgrade begins during an idle SDDC Manager session, the following UI exception is displayed: Retrieving NSXT upgrade failed with unknown exception

  This is a UI issue only. There is no impact on the upgrade workflow.

  Workaround: Refresh the web browser.
* **After upgrading to VMware Cloud Foundation 3.11 the NSX Edge password precheck is turned off**

  Enable the NSX Edge password precheck so that future upgrades of NSX-T based VI workload domains do not fail due to expired passwords.

  Workaround:

  1. SSH to the SDDC Manager appliance as the **vcf** user.
  2. Type `su` to switch to the root user.
  3. Edit the /opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/feature.properties file as shown below:

     + `#feature flag for NSXT Edge VM Password Expiry Precheck`
     + `feature.lcm.nsxt.edge.password.validation=true`
  4. Run the following command: `systemctl restart lcm`

### vRealize Suite Known Issues

* **vRealize Operations Manager: VMware Security Advisory VMSA-2021-0018**

  [VMSA-2021-0018](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2021-0018.html) describes security vulnerabilities that affect VMware Cloud Foundation.

  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains an arbitrary file read vulnerability. A malicious actor with administrative access to vRealize Operations Manager API can read any arbitrary file on server leading to information disclosure.The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22022 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API has insecure object reference vulnerability. A malicious actor with administrative access to vRealize Operations Manager API may be able to modify other users information leading to an account takeover.The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22023 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains an arbitrary log-file read vulnerability. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can read any log file resulting in sensitive information disclosure. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22024 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains a broken access control vulnerability leading to unauthenticated API access. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can add new nodes to existing vROps cluster. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifier CVE-2021-22025 to this issue.
  + The vRealize Operations Manager API contains a Server Side Request Forgery in multiple end points. An unauthenticated malicious actor with network access to the vRealize Operations Manager API can perform a Server Side Request Forgery attack leading to information disclosure. The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project (cve.mitre.org) has assigned identifiers CVE-2021-22026 and CVE-2021-22027 to this issue.

  Workaround: See [KB 85452](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/85452) for information about applying vRealize Operations Security Patches that resolve the issues.
* **The password update for vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager may run infinitely or may fail when the password contains special character "%"**

  Password management uses the vRealize Lifecycle Manager API to update the password of vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager. When there is special character "%" in either of SSH or API or Administrator credential types of the vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager users, then the vRealize Lifecycle Manager API hangs and doesn't respond to password management. There is a timeout of 5 mins and password management marks the operation as failed.

  Workaround:Retry the password update operation without the special character "%". Ensure that the passwords for all other vRealize Automation and vRealize Operations Manager accounts don't contain the "%" special character.

### Networking Known Issues

* **NSX Manager is not visible in the vSphere Web Client.**

  In addition to NSX Manager not being visible in the vSphere Web Client, the following error message displays in the NSX Home screen: "No NSX Managers available. Verify current user has role assigned on NSX Manager." This issue occurs when vCenter Server is not correctly configured for the account that is logged in.

  Workaround: To resolve this issue, follow the procedure detailed in Knowledge Base article 2080740 ["No NSX Managers available" error in the vSphere Web Client](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2080740).

### SDDC Manager Known Issues

* **Unable to delete VI workload domain enabled for vRealize Operations Manager from SDDC Manager.**

  Attempts to delete the vCenter adapter also fail, and return an SSL error.

  Workaround: Use the following procedure to resolve this issue.

  1. Create a vCenter adapter instance in vRealize Operations Manager, as described in [Configure a vCenter Adapter Instance in vRealize Operations Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Operations-Manager/7.5/com.vmware.vcom.config.doc/GUID-19DAD6AF-7262-4655-B69F-6C665E33B52F.html). This step is required because the existing adapter was deleted by the failed workload domain deletion.
  2. Follow the procedure described in [Knowledge Base article 56946](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/56946).
  3. Restart the failed VI workload domain deletion workflow from the SDDC Manager interface.
* **APIs for managing SDDC cannot be executed from the SDDC Manager Dashboard**

  You cannot use the API Explorer in the SDDC Manager Dashboard to execute the APIs for managing SDDC (`/v1/sddc`).

  Workaround: None. These APIs can only be executed using the Cloud Builder as the host.

### Workload Domain Known Issues

* **Adding host fails when host is on a different VLAN**

  A host add operation can sometimes fail if the host is on a different VLAN.

  Workaround:

  1. Before adding the host, add a new portgroup to the VDS for that cluster.
  2. Tag the new portgroup with the VLAN ID of the host to be added.
  3. Add the Host. This workflow fails at the "Migrate host vmknics to dvs" operation.
  4. Locate the failed host in vCenter, and migrate the vmk0 of the host to the new portgroup you created in step 1. For more information, see [Migrate VMkernel Adapters to a vSphere Distributed Switch](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/com.vmware.vsphere.networking.doc/GUID-0DE237B8-1938-4DE9-90EC-718E345B56A0.html) in the vSphere product documentation.
  5. Retry the Add Host operation.

  **NOTE**: If you later remove this host in the future, you must manually remove the portgroup as well if it is not being used by any other host.
* **NSX Manager for VI workload domain is not displayed in vCenter**

  Although NFS-based VI workload domains are created successfully, the NSX Manager VM is not registered in vCenter Server and is not displayed in vCenter.

  Workaround: To resolve this issue, use the following procedure:

  1. Log in to NSX Manager (http://<nsxmanager IP>).
  2. Navigate to **Manage > NSX Management Service**.
  3. Un-register the lookup service and vCenter, then re-register.
  4. Close the browser and log in to vCenter.
* **A vCenter Server on which certificates have been rotated is not accessible from a Horizon workload domain**

  VMware Cloud Foundation does not support the certificate rotation on the Horizon workload domains.

  Workaround: See KB article [70956](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/70956).
* **Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain displays an error**

  Deploying partner services on an NSX-T workload domain such as McAfee or Trend displays the “Configure NSX at cluster level to deploy Service VM” error.

  Workaround: Attach the Transport node profile to the cluster and try deploying the partner service. After the service is deployed, detach the transport node profile from the cluster.
* **If the witness ESXi version does not match with the host ESXi version in the cluster, vSAN cluster partition may occur**

  vSAN stretch cluster workflow does not check the ESXi version of the witness host. If the witness ESXi version does not match the host version in the cluster, then vSAN cluster partition may happen.

  Workaround:

  1. Upgrade the witness host manually with the matching ESXi version using the vCenter VUM functionality.
  2. Replace or deploy the witness appliance matching with the ESXi version.
* **The certificate rotate operation on the second NSX-T domain fails**

  Certificate rotation works on the first NSX-T workload domain in your environment, but fails on all subsequent NSX-T workload domains.

  Workaround: None
* **Operations on NSX-T workload domains fails if their host FQDNs include uppercase letters**

  If the FQDNs of ESXi hosts in an NSX-T workload domain include uppercase letters, then the following operations may fail for the workload domain:

  + Add a host
  + Remove a host
  + Add a cluster
  + Remove a cluster
  + Delete the workload domain

  Workaround: See [KB 76553](http://kb.vmware.com/kb/76553).
* **VI workload domain creation or expansion operations fail**

  If there is a mismatch between the letter case (upper or lower) of an ESXi host's FQDN and the FQDN used when the host was commissioned, then workload domain creation and expansion may fail.

  Workaround: ESXi hosts should have lower case FQDNs and should be commissioned using lower case FQDNs.
* **Cluster is deleted even if VMs are up and running on the cluster**

  When you delete a cluster, it gets deleted even if there are VMs running on the cluster. This includes critical VMs such as Edge VMs, which may prevent you from accessing your environment after the cluster gets deleted.

  Workaround: Migrate the VMs to a different cluster before deleting the cluster.
* **Workload domain operations fail if cluster upgrade is in progress**

  Workload domain operations cannot be performed if one or more clusters are being upgraded. The UI does not block such oeprations during an upgrade.

  Workaround: Do not perform any operations on the workload domain when a cluster upgrade is in progress.
* **If you use the special character underscore (\_) in the vCenter Server host name for the workload domain create operation, the vCenter Server deployment fails**

  The vCenter deployment fails with the **"ERROR > Section 'new\_vcsa', subsection 'network', property 'system\_name' validation"** error message.

  Workaround: None. This is an issue in the vCenter Server product installer where the installer pre-validation fails. You should create the workload domain by providing valid vCenter Server host names.

### Multi-Instance Management Known Issues

* **Federation creation information not displayed if you leave the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard**

  Federation creation progress is displayed on the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard. If you navigate to another screen and then return to the Multi-Instance Management Dashboard, progress messages are not displayed. Instead, an empty map with no Cloud Foundation instances are displayed until the federation is created.

  Workaround: Stay on the Multi-Instance Dashboard till the task is complete. If you have navigated away, wait for around 20 minutes and then return to the dashboard by which time the operation should have completed.
* **The federation creation progress is not displayed**

  While federation creation is in progress, the SDDC manager UI displays the progress on the multi-site page. If you navigate into any other screen and come back to the multi-site screen, the progress messages are not displayed. An empty map with no VMware Cloud Foundation instances is displayed until the federation creation process completes.

  Workaround: None
* **Multi-Instance Management Dashboard operation fails**

  After a controller joins or leaves a federation, Kafka is restarted on all controllers in the federation. It can take up to 15 minutes for the federation to stabilize. Any operations performed on the dashboard during this time may fail.

  Workaround: Re-try the operation.

### Backup and Restore Known Issues

* **NSX Manager restore might not complete due to certificate rejection**

  A restore might not complete as a result of an installed certificate with no CRL Distribution Point and an incorrect setting (crl\_checking\_enable configuration to true).

  Workaround: None

#### Issue/Introduction

[VMSA-2022-0004](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0004.html) details numerous vulnerabilities in VMware ESXi.
As part of the response, VMware released "back in time" patches for VMware ESXi 7.0U1 and VMware ESX 7.0U2.
This KB documents the process should customers running VMware Cloud Foundation 4.1.x, 4.2.x or 4.3.x wish to update their ESXi hosts to these releases.

[Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u1e.html) for VMware ESXi 7.0U1e
[Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u2e-release-notes.html)  for VMware ESXi 7.0U2e

**NOTE: This KB is not applicable for VCF on Dell EMC VxRail Release**

Symptoms:
As documented in [VMSA-2022-0004](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0004.html) , all versions of the VMware ESXi 7.0 prior to 7.0 Update 3c are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the advisory.
Since the VMware Cloud Foundation(VCF) 4.x versions, prior to VCF 4.4, bundle impacted releases of VMware ESXi, the VCF versions VCF 4.1.x, VCF 4.2.x and VCF 4.3.x releases, are similarly impacted by the vulnerabilities listed in the advisory.

#### Environment

VMware Cloud Foundation 4.3.x
VMware Cloud Foundation 4.2.x
VMware Cloud Foundation 4.1

#### Resolution

#### **Guidance Steps:**

1. Verify the VCF release to be able to apply ESXi Async patch.

| **VCF Release** | **Upgrade Steps** |
| --- | --- |
| VCF 4.1.0 | Upgrade to VCF 4.1.0.1, Apply [KB 87050](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87050)  and then move to Step 2. |
| VCF 4.1.0.1 | Apply [KB 87050](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87050) and then move to Step 2. |
| VCF 4.2.0 | Upgrade to VCF 4.2.1, Apply [KB 87050](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87050)  and then apply [KB 88287](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88287). |
| VCF 4.2.1 | Apply [KB 87050](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87050)  and then apply [KB 88287](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88287). |
| VCF 4.3.0 | Upgrade to VCF 4.3.1.1 as documented in [VCF 4.3.1.1 Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/4.3.1/rn/vmware-cloud-foundation-431-release-notes/index.html) and apply [KB 88287](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88287). |
| VCF 4.3.1 | Upgrade to VCF 4.3.1.1 as documented in [VCF 4.3.1.1 Release Notes](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/4.3.1/rn/vmware-cloud-foundation-431-release-notes/index.html) and apply [KB 88287](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88287). |
| VCF 4.3.1.1 | Apply [KB 88287](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/88287). |

2. Apply ESXi fix patch async outside of VCF.

    Release Notes:
    For VCF 4.1.x and 4.2.x, refer [VMware ESXi 7.0 Update 1e](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u1e.html)
    For VCF 4.3.x, refer [VMware ESXi 7.0 Update 2e](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u2e-release-notes.html)

    Using vSphere product documentation apply ESXi patch directly without using SDDC Manager.

    **Note: After ESXi hosts are async patched. Please make sure to cleanup the baselines and ISOs on vSphere UI which were created as part of the upgrade through vSphere. If not deleted, the future upgrades from VCF LCM are prone to failures.**
3. Update the SDDC Manager Inventory.

{
    "forceUpdate": true,
    "versionAliasesForBundleComponentTypes": [ {
        "bundleComponentType": "ESX\_HOST",
        "versionAliases": [ {
            "aliases": ["7.0.1-19324898"],
            "version": "7.0.2-18426014"
        } ]
    } ]
}

2. Trigger the PUT api call using the request.json payload and the output for the API call is as below.

API: curl -k '<SDDC Manager FQDN>/v1/system/settings/version-aliases' -X PUT -d @request.json  -H 'Content-Type:application/json'  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <AUTH TOKEN>'

<SDDC Manager FQDN >  -   Fully qualified domain name of SDDC manager.
<AUTH TOKEN> -   Access Token retrieved from Step 4.1.

Sample Output:

{
    "elements": [{
            "bundleComponentType": "ESX\_HOST",
            "versionAliases": [{
                "version": "7.0.2-18426014",
                "aliases": [
                    "7.0.1-19324898"
                ]
            }]
        }
    ]
}

#### **Forward upgrade path for customers on VCF 4.3.x:**

To enable forward upgrades, please follow below steps:

1. Create the API request payload:

* Open a vi editor with file name request.json

vi request.json

* Create a file request.json with below contents:

{
    "forceUpdate": true,
    "versionAliasesForBundleComponentTypes": [ {
        "bundleComponentType": "ESX\_HOST",
        "versionAliases": [ {
            "aliases": ["7.0.2-19290878"],
            "version": "7.0.2-18426014"
        } ]
    } ]
}

2. Trigger the PUT api call using the request.json payload and the output for the API call is as below.

API: curl -k '<SDDC Manager FQDN>/v1/system/settings/version-aliases' -X PUT -d @request.json  -H 'Content-Type:application/json'  -H 'Authorization: Bearer <AUTH TOKEN>'

<SDDC Manager FQDN >  -   Fully qualified domain name of SDDC manager.
<AUTH TOKEN> -   Access Token retrieved from Step 4.1.

Sample Output:
{
    "elements": [{
            "bundleComponentType": "ESX\_HOST",
            "versionAliases": [{
                "version": "7.0.2-18426014",
                "aliases": [
                    "7.0.2-19290878"
                ]
            }]
        }
    ]
}

**Note:**
VI domain creation will still be based on the VCF release BOM. For example: VI domain creation on VCF 4.2.1 will be based on the ESXi version(7.0.1-17551050) i.e [4.2.1 release BOM](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/4.2.1/rn/VMware-Cloud-Foundation-421-Release-Notes.html#swversions). Follow the Guidance Steps above to patch ESXi for a new VI.

| --- |

## What's in the Release Notes

**IMPORTANT**: ESXi 7.0 Update 1e delivers fixes for CVE-2021-22040, CVE-2021-22041, CVE-2021-22042, and CVE-2021-22043. If you do not plan to update your environment to ESXi 7.0 Update 3c (build # 19193900), use ESXi 7.0 Update 1e to update your ESXi hosts of version 7.0 Update 1d (build # 17551050) and earlier with these security fixes. The supported update path from ESXi 7.0 Update 1e is to ESXi 7.0 Update 3c or later. The upgrade path from ESXi 6.5.x and ESXi 6.7.x to ESXi 7.0 Update 1e is not supported.

 **Warning**: Updates from ESXi 7.0 Update 1е to 7.0 Update 2, 7.0 Update 2a, 7.0 Update 2c, and 7.0 Update 2d might expose your vSphere system to security vulnerabilities, because this is considered a back-in-time update.

For a table of build numbers and versions of VMware vCenter Server, see VMware knowledge base article [2143838](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2143838).

 **IMPORTANT**:

* Starting with vSphere 7.0, VMware uses components for packaging VIBs along with bulletins. The ESXi and `esx-update` bulletins are dependent on each other. Always include both in a single ESXi host patch baseline or include the rollup bulletin in the baseline to avoid failure during host patching.
* When patching ESXi hosts by using the vSphere Lifecycle Manager from a version earlier than ESXi 7.0 Update 1, it is strongly recommended to use the rollup bulletin in the patch baseline. If you cannot use the rollup bulletin, make sure to include all of the following packages in the patching baseline. If the following packages are not included in the baseline, the update operation fails:

  + VMware-vmkusb\_0.1-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher
  + VMware-vmkata\_0.1-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher
  + VMware-vmkfcoe\_1.0.0.2-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher
  + VMware-NVMeoF-RDMA\_1.0.1.2-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher

## Patch Download and Installation

In vSphere 7.x, the Update Manager plug-in, used for administering vSphere Update Manager, is replaced with the Lifecycle Manager plug-in. Administrative operations for vSphere Update Manager are still available under the Lifecycle Manager plug-in, along with new capabilities for vSphere Lifecycle Manager.
 The typical way to apply patches to ESXi 7.x hosts is by using the vSphere Lifecycle Manager. For details, see [About vSphere Lifecycle Manager](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere-lifecycle-manager.doc/GUID-74295A37-E8BB-4EB9-BFBA-47B78F0C570D.html) and [vSphere Lifecycle Manager Baselines and Images](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere-lifecycle-manager.doc/GUID-9A20C2DA-F45F-4C9B-9D17-A89BCB62E6EF.html).
 You can also update ESXi hosts without using the Lifecycle Manager plug-in, and use an image profile instead. To do this, you must manually download the patch offline bundle ZIP file from the [VMware download](https://my.vmware.com/en/web/vmware/info/slug/datacenter_cloud_infrastructure/vmware_vsphere/7_0) page or the [Product Patches](https://my.vmware.com/group/vmware/patch#search) page and use the `esxcli software profile update` command.
 For more information, see the [Upgrading Hosts by Using ESXCLI Commands](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.esxi.upgrade.doc/GUID-A4301ADA-8E02-459D-BF9D-0AD308DA5325.html) and the [VMware ESXi Upgrade](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.esxi.upgrade.doc/GUID-65B5B313-3DBB-4490-82D2-A225446F4C99.html) guide.

The ESXi and esx-update bulletins are dependent on each other. Always include both in a single ESXi host patch baseline or include the rollup bulletin in the baseline to avoid failure during host patching.

 Updates the `esx-dvfilter-generic-fastpath, vsanhealth, vdfs, vsan, esx-base, crx, native-misc-drivers, esx-xserver, gc`and `cpu-microcode` VIBs to resolve the following issues:

* This release resolves CVE-2021-22040, CVE-2021-22041, CVE-2021-22042, and CVE-2021-22043. For more information on these vulnerabilities and their impact on VMware products, see [VMSA-2022-0004](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0004.html).
* **PR 2903398: An NSX-T logical switch port, such as the Service Plane Forwarding (SPF) port, might unexpectedly be removed from a vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS)**

  An issue in the sync workflow might cause an NSX-T logical switch port, such as SPF, unexpectedly to drop from a VDS and VMs to lose network connectivity. In the backtrace, you see an error such as `Could not connect SPF port : Not found`.

  This issue is resolved in this release.

## Known Issues from Earlier Releases

To view a list of previous known issues, click here.

The earlier known issues are grouped as follows.

* [Installation, Upgrade, and Migration Issues](#installation,-upgrade,-and-migration-issues-earlier-known)
* [Security Features Issues](#security-features-issues-earlier-known)
* [Networking Issues](#networking-issues-earlier-known)
* [Storage Issues](#storage-issues-earlier-known)
* [vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues](#vcenter-server-and-vsphere-client-issues-earlier-known)

* [vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues](#vsphere-lifecycle-manager-issues-earlier-known)
* [Miscellaneous Issues](#miscellaneous-issues-earlier-known)

**Installation, Upgrade, and Migration Issues**

* **The vCenter Upgrade/Migration pre-checks fail with "Unexpected error 87"**

  The vCenter Server Upgrade/Migration pre-checks fail when the Security Token Service (STS) certificate does not contain a Subject Alternative Name (SAN) field. This situation occurs when you have replaced the vCenter 5.5 Single Sign-On certificate with a custom certificate that has no SAN field, and you attempt to upgrade to vCenter Server 7.0. The upgrade considers the STS certificate invalid and the pre-checks prevent the upgrade process from continuing.

  Workaround: Replace the STS certificate with a valid certificate that contains a SAN field then proceed with the vCenter Server 7.0 Upgrade/Migration.
* **Problems upgrading to vSphere 7.0 with pre-existing CIM providers**

  After upgrade, previously installed 32-bit CIM providers stop working because ESXi requires 64-bit CIM providers. Customers may lose management API functions related to CIMPDK, NDDK (native DDK), HEXDK, VAIODK (IO filters), and see errors related to **uwglibc** dependency.
   The syslog reports module missing, "32 bit shared libraries not loaded."

  Workaround: There is no workaround. The fix is to download new 64-bit CIM providers from your vendor.
* **Installation of 7.0 Update 1 drivers on ESXi 7.0 hosts might fail**

  You cannot install drivers applicable to ESXi 7.0 Update 1 on hosts that run ESXi 7.0 or 7.0b.
   The operation fails with an error, such as:
   `VMW_bootbank_qedrntv_3.40.4.0-12vmw.701.0.0.xxxxxxx requires vmkapi_2_7_0_0, but the requirement cannot be satisfied within the ImageProfile. ​
   Please refer to the log file for more details.`

  Workaround: Update the ESXi host to 7.0 Update 1. Retry the driver installation.
* **Upgrades to ESXi 7.x from 6.5x and 6.7.0 by using ESXCLI might fail due to a space limitation**

  Upgrades to ESXi 7.x from 6.5.x and 6.7.0 by using the `esxcli software profile update` or `esxcli software profile install` ESXCLI commands might fail, because the ESXi bootbank might be less than the size of the image profile. In the ESXi Shell or the PowerCLI shell, you see an error such as:
    `[InstallationError]
   The pending transaction requires 244 MB free space, however the maximum supported size is 239 MB.
   Please refer to the log file for more details.`
   The issue also occurs when you attempt an ESXi host upgrade by using the ESXCLI commands `esxcli software vib update` or `esxcli software vib install`.

  Workaround: You can perform the upgrade in two steps, by using the `esxcli software profile update` command to update ESXi hosts to ESXi 6.7 Update 1 or later, and then update to 7.0 Update 1c. Alternatively, you can run an upgrade by using an ISO image and the vSphere Lifecycle Manager.
* **Smart Card and RSA SecurID authentication might stop working after upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0**

  If you have configured vCenter Server for either Smart Card or RSA SecurID authentication, see the VMware knowledge base article at <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78057> before starting the vSphere 7.0 upgrade process. If you do not perform the workaround as described in the KB, you might see the following error messages and Smart Card or RSA SecurID authentication does not work.

  "Smart card authentication may stop working. Smart card settings may not be preserved, and smart card authentication may stop working."

  or

  "RSA SecurID authentication may stop working. RSA SecurID settings may not be preserved, and RSA SecurID authentication may stop working."

  Workaround: Before upgrading to vSphere 7.0, see the VMware knowledge base article at <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/78057>.
* **Upgrading a vCenter Server with an external Platform Services Controller from 6.7u3 to 7.0 fails with VMAFD error**

  When you upgrade a vCenter Server deployment using an external Platform Services Controller, you converge the Platform Services Controller into a vCenter Server appliance. If the upgrade fails with the error `install.vmafd.vmdir_vdcpromo_error_21`, the VMAFD firstboot process has failed. The VMAFD firstboot process copies the VMware Directory Service Database (data.mdb) from the source Platform Services Controller and replication partner vCenter Server appliance.

  Workaround: Disable TCP Segmentation Offload (TSO) and Generic Segmentation Offload (GSO) on the Ethernet adapter of the source Platform Services Controller or replication partner vCenter Server appliance before upgrading a vCenter Server with an external Platform Services Controller. See Knowledge Base article: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/74678
* **Upgrading vCenter Server using the CLI incorrectly preserves the Transport Security Layer (TLS) configuration for the vSphere Authentication Proxy service**

  If the vSphere Authentication Proxy service (`vmcam`) is configured to use a particular TLS protocol other than the default TLS 1.2 protocol, this configuration is preserved during the CLI upgrade process. By default, vSphere supports the TLS 1.2 encryption protocol. If you must use the TLS 1.0 and TLS 1.1 protocols to support products or services that do not support TLS 1.2, use the TLS Configurator Utility to enable or disable different TLS protocol versions.

  Workaround: Use the TLS Configurator Utility to configure the `vmcam` port. To learn how to manage TLS protocol configuration and use the TLS Configurator Utility, see the *VMware Security* documentation.
* **Smart card and RSA SecurID settings may not be preserved during vCenter Server upgrade**

  Authentication using RSA SecurID will not work after upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0. An error message will alert you to this issue when attempting to login using your RSA SecurID login.

  Workaround: Reconfigure the smart card or RSA SecureID.
* **Migration of vCenter Server for Windows to vCenter Server appliance 7.0 fails with network error message**

  Migration of vCenter Server for Windows to vCenter Server appliance 7.0 fails with the error message `IP already exists in the network`. This prevents the migration process from configuring the network parameters on the new vCenter Server appliance. For more information, examine the log file: `/var/log/vmware/upgrade/UpgradeRunner.log`

  Workaround:

  1. Verify that all Windows Updates have been completed on the source vCenter Server for Windows instance, or disable automatic Windows Updates until after the migration finishes.
  2. Retry the migration of vCenter Server for Windows to vCenter Server appliance 7.0.
* **When you configure the number of virtual functions for an SR-IOV device by using the max\_vfs module parameter, the changes might not take effect**

  In vSphere 7.0, you can configure the number of virtual functions for an SR-IOV device by using the Virtual Infrastructure Management (VIM) API, for example, through the vSphere Client. The task does not require reboot of the ESXi host. After you use the VIM API configuration, if you try to configure the number of SR-IOV virtual functions by using the `max_vfs` module parameter, the changes might not take effect because they are overridden by the VIM API configuration.

  Workaround: None. To configure the number of virtual functions for an SR-IOV device, use the same method every time. Use the VIM API or use the `max_vfs` module parameter and reboot the ESXi host.
* **Upgraded vCenter Server appliance instance does not retain all the secondary networks (NICs) from the source instance**

  During a major upgrade, if the source instance of the vCenter Server appliance is configured with multiple secondary networks other than the VCHA NIC, the target vCenter Server instance will not retain secondary networks other than the VCHA NIC. If the source instance is configured with multiple NICs that are part of DVS port groups, the NIC configuration will not be preserved during the upgrade. Configurations for vCenter Server appliance instances that are part of the standard port group will be preserved.

  Workaround: None. Manually configure the secondary network in the target vCenter Server appliance instance.
* **After upgrading or migrating a vCenter Server with an external Platform Services Controller, users authenticating using Active Directory lose access to the newly upgraded vCenter Server instance**

  After upgrading or migrating a vCenter Server with an external Platform Services Controller, if the newly upgraded vCenter Server is not joined to an Active Directory domain, users authenticating using Active Directory will lose access to the vCenter Server instance.

  Workaround: Verify that the new vCenter Server instance has been joined to an Active Directory domain. See Knowledge Base article: https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2118543
* **Migrating a vCenter Server for Windows with an external Platform Services Controller using an Oracle database fails**

  If there are non-ASCII strings in the Oracle events and tasks table the migration can fail when exporting events and tasks data. The following error message is provided: UnicodeDecodeError

  Workaround: None.
* **After an ESXi host upgrade, a Host Profile compliance check shows non-compliant status while host remediation tasks fail**

  The non-compliant status indicates an inconsistency between the profile and the host.

  This inconsistency might occur because ESXi 7.0 does not allow duplicate claim rules, but the profile you use contains duplicate rules. For example, if you attempt to use the Host Profile that you extracted from the host before upgrading ESXi 6.5 or ESXi 6.7 to version 7.0 and the Host Profile contains any duplicate claim rules of system default rules, you might experience the problems.

  Workaround:

  1. Remove any duplicate claim rules of the system default rules from the Host Profile document.
  2. Check the compliance status.
  3. Remediate the host.
  4. If the previous steps do not help, reboot the host.
* **Error message displays in the vCenter Server Management Interface**

  After installing or upgrading to vCenter Server 7.0, when you navigate to the Update panel within the vCenter Server Management Interface, the error message "Check the URL and try again" displays. The error message does not prevent you from using the functions within the Update panel, and you can view, stage, and install any available updates.

  Workaround: None.

**Security Features Issues**

* **Encrypted virtual machine fails to power on when HA-enabled Trusted Cluster contains an unattested host**

  In VMware® vSphere Trust Authority™, if you have enabled HA on the Trusted Cluster and one or more hosts in the cluster fails attestation, an encrypted virtual machine cannot power on.

  Workaround: Either remove or remediate all hosts that failed attestation from the Trusted Cluster.
* **Encrypted virtual machine fails to power on when DRS-enabled Trusted Cluster contains an unattested host**

  In VMware® vSphere Trust Authority™, if you have enabled DRS on the Trusted Cluster and one or more hosts in the cluster fails attestation, DRS might try to power on an encrypted virtual machine on an unattested host in the cluster. This operation puts the virtual machine in a locked state.

  Workaround: Either remove or remediate all hosts that failed attestation from the Trusted Cluster.
* **Migrating or cloning encrypted virtual machines across vCenter Server instances fails when attempting to do so using the vSphere Client**

  If you try to migrate or clone an encrypted virtual machine across vCenter Server instances using the vSphere Client, the operation fails with the following error message: "The operation is not allowed in the current state."

  Workaround: You must use the vSphere APIs to migrate or clone encrypted virtual machines across vCenter Server instances.

**Networking Issues**

* **Reduced throughput in networking performance on Intel 82599/X540/X550 NICs**

  The new queue-pair feature added to ixgben driver to improve networking performance on Intel 82599EB/X540/X550 series NICs might reduce throughput under some workloads in vSphere 7.0 as compared to vSphere 6.7.

  Workaround: To achieve the same networking performance as vSphere 6.7, you can disable the queue-pair with a module parameter. To disable the queue-pair, run the command:

  `# esxcli system module parameters set -p "QPair=0,0,0,0..." -m ixgben`

  After running the command, reboot.
* **One or more I/O devices do not generate interrupts when the AMD IOMMU is in use**

  If the I/O devices on your ESXi host provide more than a total of 512 distinct interrupt sources, some sources are erroneously assigned an interrupt-remapping table entry (IRTE) index in the AMD IOMMU that is greater than the maximum value. Interrupts from such a source are lost, so the corresponding I/O device behaves as if interrupts are disabled.

  Workaround: Use the ESXCLI command `esxcli system settings kernel set -s iovDisableIR -v true` to disable the AMD IOMMU interrupt remapper. Reboot the ESXi host so that the command takes effect.
* **High throughput virtual machines may experience degradation in network performance when Network I/O Control (NetIOC) is enabled**

  Virtual machines requiring high network throughput can experience throughput degradation when upgrading from vSphere 6.7 to vSphere 7.0 with NetIOC enabled.

  Workaround: Adjust the `ethernetx.ctxPerDev` setting to enable multiple worlds.
* **IPv6 traffic fails to pass through VMkernel ports using IPsec**

  When you migrate VMkernel ports from one port group to another, IPv6 traffic does not pass through VMkernel ports using IPsec.

  Workaround: Remove the IPsec security association (SA) from the affected server, and then reapply the SA. To learn how to set and remove an IPsec SA, see the *vSphere Security* documentation.
* **Higher ESX network performance with a portion of CPU usage increase**

  ESX network performance may increase with a portion of CPU usage.

  Workaround: Remove and add the network interface with only 1 rx dispatch queue. For example:

  `esxcli network ip interface remove --interface-name=vmk1`

  `esxcli network ip interface add --interface-name=vmk1 --num-rxqueue=1`
* **VM might lose Ethernet traffic after hot-add, hot-remove or storage vMotion**

  A VM might stop receiving Ethernet traffic after a hot-add, hot-remove or storage vMotion. This issue affects VMs where the uplink of the VNIC has SR-IOV enabled. PVRDMA virtual NIC exhibits this issue when the uplink of the virtual network is a Mellanox RDMA capable NIC and RDMA namespaces are configured.

  Workaround: You can hot-remove and hot-add the affected Ethernet NICs of the VM to restore traffic. On Linux guest operating systems, restarting the network might also resolve the issue. If these workarounds have no effect, you can reboot the VM to restore network connectivity.
* **Change of IP address for a VCSA deployed with static IP address requires that you create the DNS records in advance**

  With the introduction of the DDNS, the DNS record update only works for VCSA deployed with DHCP configured networking. While changing the IP address of the vCenter server via VAMI, the following error is displayed:

  The specified IP address does not resolve to the specified hostname.

  Workaround: There are two possible workarounds.

  1. Create an additional DNS entry with the same FQDN and desired IP address. Log in to the VAMI and follow the steps to change the IP address.
  2. Log in to the VCSA using ssh. Execute the following script:

     `./opt/vmware/share/vami/vami_config_net`

     Use option 6 to change the IP adddress of eth0. Once changed, execute the following script:

     `./opt/likewise/bin/lw-update-dns`

     Restart all the services on the VCSA to update the IP information on the DNS server.
* **It may take several seconds for the NSX Distributed Virtual Port Group (NSX DVPG) to be removed after deleting the corresponding logical switch in NSX Manager.**

  As the number of logical switches increases, it may take more time for the NSX DVPG in vCenter Server to be removed after deleting the corresponding logical switch in NSX Manager. In an environment with 12000 logical switches, it takes approximately 10 seconds for an NSX DVPG to be deleted from vCenter Server.

  Workaround: None.
* **Hostd runs out of memory and fails if a large number of NSX Distributed Virtual port groups are created.**

  In vSphere 7.0, NSX Distributed Virtual port groups consume significantly larger amounts of memory than opaque networks. For this reason, NSX Distributed Virtual port groups can not support the same scale as an opaque network given the same amount of memory.

  Workaround:To support the use of NSX Distributed Virtual port groups, increase the amount of memory in your ESXi hosts. If you verify that your system has adequate memory to support your VMs, you can directly increase the memory of `hostd` using the following command.

  `localcli --plugin-dir /usr/lib/vmware/esxcli/int/ sched group setmemconfig --group-path host/vim/vmvisor/hostd --units mb --min 2048 --max 2048`

  Note that this will cause `hostd` to use memory normally reserved for your environment's VMs. This may have the affect of reducing the number of VMs your ESXi host can support.
* **DRS may incorrectly launch vMotion if the network reservation is configured on a VM**

  If the network reservation is configured on a VM, it is expected that DRS only migrates the VM to a host that meets the specified requirements. In a cluster with NSX transport nodes, if some of the transport nodes join the transport zone by NSX-T Virtual Distributed Switch (N-VDS), and others by vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS) 7.0, DRS may incorrectly launch vMotion. You might encounter this issue when:

  + The VM connects to an NSX logical switch configured with a network reservation.
  + Some transport nodes join transport zone using N-VDS, and others by VDS 7.0, or, transport nodes join the transport zone through different VDS 7.0 instances.

  Workaround: Make all transport nodes join the transport zone by N-VDS or the same VDS 7.0 instance.
* **When adding a VMkernel NIC (vmknic) to an NSX portgroup, vCenter Server reports the error "Connecting VMKernel adapter to a NSX Portgroup on a Stateless host is not a supported operation. Please use Distributed Port Group instead."**
  + For stateless ESXi on Distributed Virtual Switch (DVS), the vmknic on a NSX port group is blocked. You must instead use a Distributed Port Group.
  + For stateful ESXi on DVS, vmknic on NSX port group is supported, but vSAN may have an issue if it is using vmknic on a NSX port group.

  Workaround: Use a Distributed Port Group on the same DVS.
* **Enabling SRIOV from vCenter for QLogic 4x10GE QL41164HFCU CNA might fail**

  If you navigate to the **Edit Settings** dialog for physical network adapters and attempt to enable SR-IOV, the operation might fail when using QLogic 4x10GE QL41164HFCU CNA. Attempting to enable SR-IOV might lead to a network outage of the ESXi host.

  Workaround: Use the following command on the ESXi host to enable SRIOV:

  `esxcfg-module`
* **vCenter Server fails if the hosts in a cluster using Distributed Resource Scheduler (DRS) join NSX-T networking by a different Virtual Distributed Switch (VDS) or combination of NSX-T Virtual Distributed Switch (NVDS) and VDS**

  In vSphere 7.0, when using NSX-T networking on vSphere VDS with a DRS cluster, if the hosts do not join the NSX transport zone by the same VDS or NVDS, it can cause vCenter Server to fail.

  Workaround: Have hosts in a DRS cluster join the NSX transport zone using the same VDS or NVDS.

**Storage Issues**

* **VMFS datastores are not mounted automatically after disk hot remove and hot insert on HPE Gen10 servers with SmartPQI controllers**

  When SATA disks on HPE Gen10 servers with SmartPQI controllers without expanders are hot removed and hot inserted back to a different disk bay of the same machine, or when multiple disks are hot removed and hot inserted back in a different order, sometimes a new local name is assigned to the disk. The VMFS datastore on that disk appears as a snapshot and will not be mounted back automatically because the device name has changed.

  Workaround: None. SmartPQI controller does not support unordered hot remove and hot insert operations.
* **ESXi might terminate I/O to NVMeOF devices due to errors on all active paths**

  Occasionally, all active paths to NVMeOF device register I/O errors due to link issues or controller state. If the status of one of the paths changes to Dead, the High Performance Plug-in (HPP) might not select another path if it shows high volume of errors. As a result, the I/O fails.

  Workaround: Disable the configuration option **/Misc/HppManageDegradedPaths** to unblock the I/O.
* **VOMA check on NVMe based VMFS datastores fails with error**

  VOMA check is not supported for NVMe based VMFS datastores and will fail with the error:

  ```
  ERROR: Failed to reserve device. Function not implemented
  ```

  Example:

  ```
  # voma -m vmfs -f check -d /vmfs/devices/disks/: <partition#>
  Running VMFS Checker version 2.1 in check mode
  Initializing LVM metadata, Basic Checks will be done

  Checking for filesystem activity
  Performing filesystem liveness check..|Scanning for VMFS-6 host activity (4096 bytes/HB, 1024 HBs).
  ERROR: Failed to reserve device. Function not implemented
  Aborting VMFS volume check
  VOMA failed to check device : General Error
  ```

  Workaround: None. If you need to analyse VMFS metadata, collect it using the `-l` option, and pass to VMware customer support. The command for collecting the dump is:

  ```
  voma -l -f dump -d /vmfs/devices/disks/:<partition#>
  ```
* **Using the VM reconfigure API to attach an encrypted First Class Disk to an encrypted virtual machine might fail with error**

  If an FCD and a VM are encrypted with different crypto keys, your attempts to attach the encrypted FCD to the encrypted VM using the `VM reconfigure API` might fail with the error message:

  ```
  Cannot decrypt disk because key or password is incorrect.
  ```

  Workaround: Use the `attachDisk API` rather than the `VM reconfigure API` to attach an encrypted FCD to an encrypted VM.
* **ESXi host might get in non responding state if a non-head extent of its spanned VMFS datastore enters the Permanent Device Loss (PDL) state**

  This problem does not occur when a non-head extent of the spanned VMFS datastore fails along with the head extent. In this case, the entire datastore becomes inaccessible and no longer allows I/Os.

  In contrast, when only a non-head extent fails, but the head extent remains accessible, the datastore heartbeat appears to be normal. And the I/Os between the host and the datastore continue. However, any I/Os that depend on the failed non-head extent start failing as well. Other I/O transactions might accumulate while waiting for the failing I/Os to resolve, and cause the host to enter the non responding state.

  Workaround: Fix the PDL condition of the non-head extent to resolve this issue.
* **After recovering from APD or PDL conditions, VMFS datastore with enabled support for clustered virtual disks might remain inaccessible**

  You can encounter this problem only on datastores where the clustered virtual disk support is enabled. When the datastore recovers from an All Paths Down (APD) or Permanent Device Loss (PDL) condition, it remains inaccessible. The VMkernel log might show multiple `SCSI3 reservation conflict`  messages similar to the following:

  `2020-02-18T07:41:10.273Z cpu22:1001391219)ScsiDeviceIO: vm 1001391219: SCSIDeviceCmdCompleteCB:2972: Reservation conflict retries 544 for command 0x45ba814b8340 (op: 0x89) to device "naa.624a9370b97601e346f64ba900024d53"`

  The problem can occur because the ESXi host participating in the cluster loses SCSI reservations for the datastore and cannot always reacquire them automatically after the datastore recovers.

  Workaround: Manually register the reservation using the following command:

  `vmkfstools -L registerkey /vmfs/devices/disks/<device name>`

  where the `<device name>` is the name of the device on which the datastore is created.
* **Virtual NVMe Controller is the default disk controller for Windows 10 guest operating systems**

  The Virtual NVMe Controller is the default disk controller for the following guest operating systems when using Hardware Version 15 or later:

  Windows 10
   Windows Server 2016
   Windows Server 2019

  Some features might not be available when using a Virtual NVMe Controller. For more information, see <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/2147714>

  **Note**: Some clients use the previous default of LSI Logic SAS. This includes ESXi host client and PowerCLI.

  Workaround: If you need features not available on Virtual NVMe, switch to VMware Paravirtual SCSI (PVSCSI) or LSI Logic SAS. For information on using VMware Paravirtual SCSI (PVSCSI), see <https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/1010398>
* **After an ESXi host upgrade to vSphere 7.0, presence of duplicate core claim rules might cause unexpected behavior**

  Claim rules determine which multipathing plugin, such as NMP, HPP, and so on, owns paths to a particular storage device. ESXi 7.0 does not support duplicate claim rules. However, the ESXi 7.0 host does not alert you if you add duplicate rules to the existing claim rules inherited through an upgrade from a legacy release. As a result of using duplicate rules, storage devices might be claimed by unintended plugins, which can cause unexpected outcome.

  Workaround: Do not use duplicate core claim rules. Before adding a new claim rule, delete any existing matching claim rule.
* **A CNS query with the compliance status filter set might take unusually long time to complete**

  The CNS QueryVolume API enables you to obtain information about the CNS volumes, such as volume health and compliance status. When you check the compliance status of individual volumes, the results are obtained quickly. However, when you invoke the CNS QueryVolume API to check the compliance status of multiple volumes, several tens or hundreds, the query might perform slowly.

  Workaround: Avoid using bulk queries. When you need to get compliance status, query one volume at a time or limit the number of volumes in the query API to 20 or fewer. While using the query, avoid running other CNS operations to get the best performance.
* **A VMFS datastore backed by an NVMe over Fabrics namespace or device might become permanently inaccessible after recovering from an APD or PDL failure**

  If a VMFS datastore on an ESXi host is backed by an NVMe over Fabrics namespace or device, in case of an all paths down (APD) or permanent device loss (PDL) failure, the datastore might be inaccessible even after recovery. You cannot access the datastore from either the ESXi host or the vCenter Server system.

  Workaround: To recover from this state, perform a rescan on a host or cluster level. For more information, see [Perform Storage Rescan](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.storage.doc/GUID-D0595EB3-D20C-4951-88EF-5AFB0BF2398D.html).
* **Deleted CNS volumes might temporarily appear as existing in the CNS UI**

  After you delete an FCD disk that backs a CNS volume, the volume might still show up as existing in the CNS UI. However, your attempts to delete the volume fail. You might see an error message similar to the following:
   `The object or item referred to could not be found`.

  Workaround: The next full synchronization will resolve the inconsistency and correctly update the CNS UI.
* **Attempts to attach multiple CNS volumes to the same pod might occasionally fail with an error**

  When you attach multiple volumes to the same pod simultaneously, the attach operation might occasionally choose the same controller slot. As a result, only one of the operations succeeds, while other volume mounts fail.

  Workaround: After Kubernetes retries the failed operation, the operation succeeds if a controller slot is available on the node VM.
* **Under certain circumstances, while a CNS operation fails, the task status appears as successful in the vSphere Client**

  This might occur when, for example, you use an incompliant storage policy to create a CNS volume. The operation fails, while the vSphere Client shows the task status as successful.

  Workaround: The successful task status in the vSphere Client does not guarantee that the CNS operation succeeded. To make sure the operation succeeded, verify its results.
* **Unsuccessful delete operation for a CNS persistent volume might leave the volume undeleted on the vSphere datastore**

  This issue might occur when the CNS Delete API attempts to delete a persistent volume that is still attached to a pod. For example, when you delete the Kubernetes namespace where the pod runs. As a result, the volume gets cleared from CNS and  the CNS query operation does not return the volume. However, the volume continues to reside on the datastore and cannot be deleted through the repeated CNS Delete API operations.

  Workaround: None.

**vCenter Server and vSphere Client Issues**

* **Vendor providers go offline after a PNID change​**

  When you change the vCenter IP address (PNID change), the registered vendor providers go offline.

  Workaround: Re-register the vendor providers.
* **Cross vCenter migration of a virtual machine fails with an error**

  When you use cross vCenter vMotion to move a VM's storage and host to a different vCenter server instance, you might receive the error `The operation is not allowed in the current state.`

  This error appears in the UI wizard after the Host Selection step and before the Datastore Selection step, in cases where the VM has an assigned storage policy containing host-based rules such as encryption or any other IO filter rule.

  Workaround: Assign the VM and its disks to a storage policy without host-based rules. You might need to decrypt the VM if the source VM is encrypted. Then retry the cross vCenter vMotion action.
* **Storage Sensors information in Hardware Health tab shows incorrect values on vCenter UI, host UI, and MOB**

  When you navigate to **Host > Monitor > Hardware Health > Storage Sensors** on vCenter UI, the storage information displays either incorrect or unknown values. The same issue is observed on the host UI and the MOB path “runtime.hardwareStatusInfo.storageStatusInfo” as well.

  Workaround: None.
* **vSphere UI host advanced settings shows the current product locker location as empty with an empty default**

  vSphere UI host advanced settings shows the current product locker location as empty with an empty default. This is inconsistent as the actual product location `symlink` is created and valid. This causes confusion to the user. The default cannot be corrected from UI.

  Workaround: User can use the esxcli command on the host to correct the current product locker location default as below.

  1. Remove the existing Product Locker Location setting with: `"esxcli system settings advanced remove -o ProductLockerLocation"`

  2. Re-add the Product Locker Location setting with the appropriate default:

  2.a.  If the ESXi is a full installation, the default value is `"/locker/packages/vmtoolsRepo" export PRODUCT_LOCKER_DEFAULT="/locker/packages/vmtoolsRepo"`

  2.b. If the ESXi is a PXEboot configuration such as autodeploy, the default value is: "`/vmtoolsRepo" export PRODUCT_LOCKER_DEFAULT="/vmtoolsRepo"`

  Run the following command to automatically figure out the location: `export PRODUCT_LOCKER_DEFAULT=`readlink /productLocker``

  Add the setting: `esxcli system settings advanced add -d "Path to VMware Tools repository" -o ProductLockerLocation -t string -s $PRODUCT_LOCKER_DEFAULT`

  You can combine all the above steps in step 2 by issuing the single command:

  `esxcli system settings advanced add -d "Path to VMware Tools repository" -o ProductLockerLocation -t string -s `readlink /productLocker``
* **Linked Software-Defined Data Center (SDDC) vCenter Server instances appear in the on-premises vSphere Client if a vCenter Cloud Gateway is linked to the SDDC.**

  When a vCenter Cloud Gateway is deployed in the same environment as an on-premises vCenter Server, and linked to an SDDC, the SDDC vCenter Server will appear in the on-premises vSphere Client. This is unexpected behavior and the linked SDDC vCenter Server should be ignored. All operations involving the linked SDDC vCenter Server should be performed on the vSphere Client running within the vCenter Cloud Gateway.

  Workaround: None.

**Virtual Machine Management Issues**

* **Virtual machines with enabled AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES) cannot create Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI) sockets**

  Performance and functionality of features that require VMCI might be affected on virtual machines with enabled AMD SEV-ES, because such virtual machines cannot create VMCI sockets.

  Workaround: None.
* **The postcustomization section of the customization script runs before the guest customization**

  When you run the guest customization script for a Linux guest operating system, the `precustomization` section of the customization script that is defined in the customization specification runs before the guest customization and the `postcustomization` section runs after that. If you enable Cloud-Init in the guest operating system of a virtual machine, the `postcustomization`section runs before the customization due to a known issue in Cloud-Init.

  Workaround: Disable Cloud-Init and use the standard guest customization.
* **Group migration operations in vSphere vMotion, Storage vMotion, and vMotion without shared storage fail with error**

  When you perform group migration operations on VMs with multiple disks and multi-level snapshots, the operations might fail with the error `com.vmware.vc.GenericVmConfigFault Failed waiting for data. Error 195887167. Connection closed by remote host, possibly due to timeout.`

  Workaround: Retry the migration operation on the failed VMs one at a time.
* **Deploying an OVF or OVA template from a URL fails with a 403 Forbidden error**

  The URLs that contain an HTTP query parameter are not supported. For example, `http://webaddress.com?file=abc.ovf` or the Amazon pre-signed S3 URLs.

  Workaround: Download the files and deploy them from your local file system.
* **Importing or deploying local OVF files containing non-ASCII characters in their name might fail with an error**

  When you import local `.ovf` files containing non-ASCII characters in their name, you might receive `400 Bad Request Error`. When you use such `.ovf` files to deploy a virtual machine in the vSphere Client, the deployment process stops at 0%. As a result, you might receive `400 Bad Request Error`or `500 Internal Server Error`.

  Workaround:

  1. Remove the non-ASCII characters from the `.ovf` and `.vmdk` file names.
     + To edit the .`ovf` file, open it with a text editor.
     + Search the non-ASCII `.vmdk` file name and change it to ASCII.
  2. Import or deploy the saved files again.
* **The third level of nested objects in a virtual machine folder is not visible**

  Perform the following steps:

  1. Navigate to a data center and create a virtual machine folder.
  2. In the virtual machine folder, create a nested virtual machine folder.
  3. In the second folder, create another nested virtual machine, virtual machine folder, vApp, or VM Template.

  As a result, from the VMs and Templates inventory tree you cannot see the objects in the third nested folder.

  Workaround: To see the objects in the third nested folder, navigate to the second nested folder and select the VMs tab.

**vSphere HA and Fault Tolerance Issues**

* **VMs in a cluster might be orphaned after recovering from storage inaccessibility such as a cluster wide APD**

  Some VMs might be in orphaned state after cluster wide APD recovers, even if HA and VMCP are enabled on the cluster.

  This issue might be encountered when the following conditions occur simultaneously:

  + All hosts in the cluster experience APD and do not recover until VMCP timeout is reached.
  + HA primary initiates failover due to APD on a host.
  + Power on API during HA failover fails due to one of the following:
    - APD across the same host
    - Cascading APD across the entire cluster
    - Storage issues
    - Resource unavailability
  + FDM unregistration and VCs steal VM logic might initiate during a window where FDM has not unregistered the failed VM and VC's host synchronization responds that multiple hosts are reporting the same VM. Both FDM and VC unregister the different registered copies of the same VM from different hosts, causing the VM to be orphaned.

  Workaround: You must unregister and reregister the orphaned VMs manually within the cluster after the APD recovers.

  If you do not manually reregister the orphaned VMs, HA attempts failover of the orphaned VMs, but it might take between 5 to 10 hours depending on when APD recovers.

  The overall functionality of the cluster is not affected in these cases and HA will continue to protect the VMs. This is an anomaly in what gets displayed on VC for the duration of the problem.

**vSphere Lifecycle Manager Issues**

* **You cannot enable NSX-T on a cluster that is already enabled for managing image setup and updates on all hosts collectively**

  NSX-T is not compatible with the vSphere Lifecycle Manager functionality for image management. When you enable a cluster for image setup and updates on all hosts in the cluster collectively, you cannot enable NSX-T on that cluster. However, you can deploy NSX Edges to this cluster.

  Workaround: Move the hosts to a new cluster that you can manage with baselines and enable NSX-T on that new cluster.
* **vSphere Lifecycle Manager and vSAN File Services cannot be simultaneously enabled on a vSAN cluster in vSphere 7.0 release**

  If vSphere Lifecycle Manager is enabled on a cluster, vSAN File Services cannot be enabled on the same cluster and vice versa. In order to enable vSphere Lifecycle Manager on a cluster, which has VSAN File Services enabled already, first disable vSAN File Services and retry the operation. Please note that if you transition to a cluster that is managed by a single image, vSphere Lifecycle Manager cannot be disabled on that cluster.

  Workaround: None.
* **ESXi 7.0 hosts cannot be added to а cluster that you manage with a single image by using vSphere Auto Deploy**

  Attempting to add ESXi hosts to а cluster that you manage with a single image by using the "Add to Inventory" workflow in vSphere Auto Deploy fails. The failure occurs because no patterns are matched in an existing Auto Deploy ruleset. The task fails silently and the hosts remain in the Discovered Hosts tab.

  Workaround:

  1. Remove the ESXi hosts that did not match the ruleset from the Discovered Hosts tab.
  2. Create a rule or edit an existing Auto Deploy rule, where the host target location is a cluster managed by an image.
  3. Reboot the hosts.

  The hosts are added to the cluster that you manage by an image in vSphere Lifecycle Manager.
* **When a hardware support manager is unavailable, vSphere High Availability (HA) functionality is impacted**

  If hardware support manager is unavailable for a cluster that you manage with a single image, where a firmware and drivers addon is selected and vSphere HA is enabled, the vSphere HA functionality is impacted. You may experience the following errors.

  + Configuring vSphere HA on a cluster fails.
  + Cannot complete the configuration of the vSphere HA agent on a host: `Applying HA VIBs on the cluster encountered a failure.`
  + Remediating vSphere HA fails: `A general system error occurred: Failed to get Effective Component map.`
  + Disabling vSphere HA fails: Delete Solution task failed. `A general system error occurred: Cannot find hardware support package from depot or hardware support manager.`

  Workaround:

  + If the hardware support manager is temporarily unavailable, perform the following steps.
  1. Reconnect the hardware support manager to vCenter Server.
  2. Select a cluster from the Hosts and Cluster menu.
  3. Select the Configure tab.
  4. Under Services, click vSphere Availability.
  5. Re-enable vSphere HA.
  + If the hardware support manager is permanently unavailable, perform the following steps.
  1. Remove the hardware support manager and the hardware support package from the image specification
  2. Re-enable vSphere HA.
  3. Select a cluster from the Hosts and Cluster menu.
  4. Select the Updates tab.
  5. Click Edit .
  6. Remove the firmware and drivers addon and click Save.
  7. Select the Configure tab.
  8. Under Services, click vSphere Availability.
  9. Re-enable vSphere HA.
* **I/OFilter is not removed from a cluster after a remediation process in vSphere Lifecycle Manager**

  Removing I/OFilter from a cluster by remediating the cluster in vSphere Lifecycle Manager, fails with the following error message: `iofilter XXX already exists`. Тhe iofilter remains listed as installed.

  Workaround:

  1. Call IOFilter API `UninstallIoFilter_Task` from the vCenter Server managed object (IoFilterManager).
  2. Remediate the cluster in vSphere Lifecycle Manager.
  3. Call IOFilter API `ResolveInstallationErrorsOnCluster_Task` from the vCenter Server managed object (IoFilterManager) to update the database.
* **While remediating a vSphere HA enabled cluster in vSphere Lifecycle Manager, adding hosts causes a vSphere HA error state**

  Adding one or multiple ESXi hosts during a remediation process of a vSphere HA enabled cluster, results in the following error message: `Applying HA VIBs on the cluster encountered a failure.`

  Workaround: Аfter the cluster remediation operation has finished, perform one of the following tasks.

  + Right-click the failed ESXi host and select *Reconfigure for vSphere HA*.
  + Disable and re-enable vSphere HA for the cluster.
* **While remediating a vSphere HA enabled cluster in vSphere Lifecycle Manager, disabling and re-enabling vSphere HA causes a vSphere HA error state**

  Disabling and re-enabling vSphere HA during remediation process of a cluster, may fail the remediation process due to vSphere HA health checks reporting that hosts don't have vSphere HA VIBs installed. You may see the following error message: `Setting desired image spec for cluster failed`.

  Workaround: Аfter the cluster remediation operation has finished, disable and re-enable vSphere HA for the cluster.
* **Checking for recommended images in vSphere Lifecycle Manager has slow performance in large clusters**

  In large clusters with more than 16 hosts, the recommendation generation task could take more than an hour to finish or may appear to hang. The completion time for the recommendation task depends on the number of devices configured on each host and the number of image candidates from the depot that vSphere Lifecycle Manager needs to process before obtaining a valid image to recommend.

  Workaround: None.
* **Checking for hardware compatibility in vSphere Lifecycle Manager has slow performance in large clusters**

  In large clusters with more than 16 hosts, the validation report generation task could take up to 30 minutes to finish or may appear to hang. The completion time depends on the number of devices configured on each host and the number of hosts configured in the cluster.

  Workaround: None
* **Incomplete error messages in non-English languages are displayed, when remediating a cluster in vSphere Lifecycle Manager**

  You can encounter incomplete error messages for localized languages in the vCenter Server user interface. The messages are displayed, after a cluster remediation process in vSphere Lifecycle Manager fails. For example, your can observe the following error message.

   The error message in English language: `Virtual machine 'VMC on DELL EMC -FileServer' that runs on cluster 'Cluster-1' reported an issue which prevents entering maintenance mode: Unable to access the virtual machine configuration: Unable to access file[local-0] VMC on Dell EMC - FileServer/VMC on Dell EMC - FileServer.vmx`

   The error message in French language: `La VM « VMC on DELL EMC -FileServer », située sur le cluster « {Cluster-1} », a signalé un problème empêchant le passage en mode de maintenance : Unable to access the virtual machine configuration: Unable to access file[local-0] VMC on Dell EMC - FileServer/VMC on Dell EMC - FileServer.vmx`

  Workaround: None.
* **Importing an image with no vendor addon, components, or firmware and drivers addon to a cluster which image contains such elements, does not remove the image elements of the existing image**

  Only the ESXi base image is replaced with the one from the imported image.

  Workaround: After the import process finishes, edit the image, and if needed, remove the vendor addon, components, and firmware and drivers addon.
* **When you convert a cluster that uses baselines to a cluster that uses a single image, a warning is displayed that vSphere HA VIBs will be removed**

  Converting a vSphere HA enabled cluster that uses baselines to a cluster that uses a single image, may result a warning message displaying that `vmware-fdm` component will be removed.

  Workaround: This message can be ignored. The conversion process installs the `vmware-fdm` component.
* **If vSphere Update Manager is configured to download patch updates from the Internet through a proxy server, after upgrade to vSphere 7.0 that converts Update Manager to vSphere Lifecycle Manager, downloading patches from VMware patch repository might fail**

  In earlier releases of vCenter Server you could configure independent proxy settings for vCenter Server and vSphere Update Manager. After an upgrade to vSphere 7.0, vSphere Update Manager service becomes part of the vSphere Lifecycle Manager service. For the vSphere Lifecycle Manager service, the proxy settings are configured from the vCenter Server appliance settings. If you had configured Update Manager to download patch updates from the Internet through a proxy server but the vCenter Server appliance had no proxy setting configuration, after a vCenter Server upgrade to version 7.0, the vSphere Lifecycle Manager fails to connect to the VMware depot and is unable to download patches or updates.

  Workaround: Log in to the vCenter Server Appliance Management Interface, https://*vcenter-server-appliance-FQDN-or-IP-address*:5480, to configure proxy settings for the vCenter Server appliance and enable vSphere Lifecycle Manager to use proxy.

**Miscellaneous Issues**

* **When applying a host profile with version 6.5 to a ESXi host with version 7.0, the compliance check fails**

  Applying a host profile with version 6.5 to a ESXi host with version 7.0, results in Coredump file profile reported as not compliant with the host.

  Workaround: There are two possible workarounds.

  1. When you create a host profile with version 6.5, set an advanced configuration option VMkernel.Boot.autoCreateDumpFile to false on the ESXi host.
  2. When you apply an existing host profile with version 6.5, add an advanced configuration option VMkernel.Boot.autoCreateDumpFile in the host profile, configure the option to a fixed policy, and set value to false.
* **The Actions drop-down menu does not contain any items when your browser is set to language different from English**

  When your browser is set to language different from English and you click the **Switch to New View**button from the virtual machine **Summary**tab of the vSphere Client inventory, the **Actions**drop-down menu in the **Guest OS**panel does not contain any items.

  Workaround: Select the **Actions**drop-down menu on the top of the virtual machine page.
* **Mellanox ConnectX-4 or ConnectX-5 native ESXi drivers might exhibit minor throughput degradation when Dynamic Receive Side Scaling (DYN\_RSS) or Generic RSS (GEN\_RSS) feature is turned on**

  Mellanox ConnectX-4 or ConnectX-5 native ESXi drivers might exhibit less than 5 percent throughput degradation when DYN\_RSS and GEN\_RSS feature is turned on, which is unlikely to impact normal workloads.

  Workaround: You can disable DYN\_RSS and GEN\_RSS feature with the following commands:

  `# esxcli system module parameters set -m nmlx5_core -p "DYN_RSS=0 GEN_RSS=0"`

  `# reboot`
* **RDMA traffic between two VMs on the same host might fail in PVRDMA environment**

  In a vSphere 7.0 implementation of a PVRDMA environment, VMs pass traffic through the HCA for local communication if an HCA is present. However, loopback of RDMA traffic does not work on qedrntv driver.  For instance, RDMA Queue Pairs running on VMs that are configured under same uplink port cannot communicate with each other.

  In vSphere 6.7 and earlier, HCA was used for local RDMA traffic if SRQ was enabled. vSphere 7.0 uses HCA loopback with VMs using versions of PVRDMA that have SRQ enabled with a minimum of HW v14 using RoCE v2.

  The current version of Marvell FastLinQ adapter firmware does not support loopback traffic between QPs of the same PF or port.

  Workaround: Required support is being added in the out-of-box driver certified for vSphere 7.0. If you are using the inbox qedrntv driver, you must use a 3-host configuration and migrate VMs to the third host.
* **Unreliable Datagram traffic QP limitations in qedrntv driver**

  There are limitations with the Marvell FastLinQ qedrntv RoCE driver and Unreliable Datagram (UD) traffic. UD applications involving bulk traffic might fail with qedrntv driver. Additionally, UD QPs can only work with DMA Memory Regions (MR). Physical MRs or FRMR are not supported. Applications attempting to use physical MR or FRMR along with UD QP fail to pass traffic when used with qedrntv driver. Known examples of such test applications are `ibv_ud_pingpong` and `ib_send_bw`.

  Standard RoCE and RoCEv2 use cases in a VMware ESXi environment such as iSER, NVMe-oF (RoCE) and PVRDMA are not impacted by this issue. Use cases for UD traffic are limited and this issue impacts a small set of applications requiring bulk UD traffic.

  Marvell FastLinQ hardware does not support RDMA UD traffic offload. In order to meet the VMware PVRDMA requirement to support GSI QP, a restricted software only implementation of UD QP support was added to the qedrntv driver. The goal of the implementation is to provide support for control path GSI communication and is not a complete implementation of UD QP supporting bulk traffic and advanced features.

  Since UD support is implemented in software, the implementation might not keep up with heavy traffic and packets might be dropped. This can result in failures with bulk UD traffic.

  Workaround: Bulk UD QP traffic is not supported with qedrntv driver and there is no workaround at this time. VMware ESXi RDMA (RoCE) use cases like iSER, NVMe, RDMA and PVRDMA are unaffected by this issue.
* **Servers equipped with QLogic 578xx NIC might fail when frequently connecting or disconnecting iSCSI LUNs**

  If you trigger QLogic 578xx NIC iSCSI connection or disconnection frequently in a short time, the server might fail due to an issue with the qfle3 driver. This is caused by a known defect in the device's firmware.

  Workaround: None.
* **ESXi might fail during driver unload or controller disconnect operation in Broadcom NVMe over FC environment**

  In Broadcom NVMe over FC environment, ESXi might fail during driver unload or controller disconnect operation and display an error message such as: `@BlueScreen: #PF Exception 14 in world 2098707:vmknvmeGener IP 0x4200225021cc addr 0x19`

  Workaround: None.
* **ESXi does not display OEM firmware version number of i350/X550 NICs on some Dell servers**

  The inbox ixgben driver only recognizes firmware data version or signature for i350/X550 NICs. On some Dell servers the OEM firmware version number is programmed into the OEM package version region, and the inbox ixgben driver does not read this information. Only the 8-digit firmware signature is displayed.

  Workaround: To display the OEM firmware version number, install async ixgben driver version 1.7.15 or later.
* **X710 or XL710 NICs might fail in ESXi**

  When you initiate certain destructive operations to X710 or XL710 NICs, such as resetting the NIC or manipulating VMKernel's internal device tree, the NIC hardware might read data from non-packet memory.

  Workaround: Do not reset the NIC or manipulate vmkernel internal device state.
* **NVMe-oF does not guarantee persistent VMHBA name after system reboot**

  NVMe-oF is a new feature in vSphere 7.0. If your server has a USB storage installation that uses vmhba30+ and also has NVMe over RDMA configuration, the VMHBA name might change after a system reboot. This is because the VMHBA name assignment for NVMe over RDMA is different from PCIe devices. ESXi does not guarantee persistence.

  Workaround: None.
* **Backup fails for vCenter database size of 300 GB or greater**

  If the vCenter database size is 300 GB or greater, the file-based backup will fail with a timeout. The following error message is displayed: `Timeout! Failed to complete in 72000 seconds`

  Workaround: None.
* **A restore of vCenter Server 7.0 which is upgraded from vCenter Server 6.x with External Platform Services Controller to vCenter Server 7.0 might fail**

  When you restore a vCenter Server 7.0 which is upgraded from 6.x with External Platform Services Controller to vCenter Server 7.0, the restore might fail and display the following error: `Failed to retrieve appliance storage list`

  Workaround: During the first stage of the restore process, increase the storage level of the vCenter Server 7.0. For example if the vCenter Server 6.7 External Platform Services Controller setup storage type is small, select storage type large for the restore process.
* **Enabled SSL protocols configuration parameter is not configured during a host profile remediation process**

  `Enabled SSL protocols` configuration parameter is not configured during a host profile remediation and only the system default protocol `tlsv1.2` is enabled. This behavior is observed for a host profile with version 7.0 and earlier in a vCenter Server 7.0 environment.

  Workaround: To enable TLSV 1.0 or TLSV 1.1 SSL protocols for SFCB, log in to an ESXi host by using SSH, and run the following ESXCLI command: `esxcli system wbem -P <protocol_name>`
* **Unable to configure Lockdown Mode settings by using Host Profiles**

  Lockdown Мode cannot be configured by using a security host profile and cannot be applied to multiple ESXi hosts at once. You must manually configure each host.

  Workaround: In vCenter Server 7.0, you can configure Lockdown Mode and manage Lockdown Mode exception user list by using a security host profile.
* **When a host profile is applied to a cluster, Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) settings are missing from the ESXi hosts**

  Some settings in the VMware config file `/etc/vmware/config` are not managed by Host Profiles and are blocked, when the config file is modified. As a result, when the host profile is applied to a cluster, the EVC settings are lost, which causes loss of EVC functionalities. For example, unmasked CPUs can be exposed to workloads.

  Workaround: Reconfigure the relevant EVC baseline on cluster to recover the EVC settings.
* **Using a host profile that defines a core dump partition in vCenter Server 7.0 results in an error**

  In vCenter Server 7.0, configuring and managing a core dump partition in a host profile is not available. Attempting to apply a host profile that defines a core dump partition, results in the following error: `No valid coredump partition found.`

  Workaround: None. In vCenter Server 7.0., Host Profiles supports only file-based core dumps.
* **If you run the ESXCLI command to unload the firewall module, the hostd service fails and ESXi hosts lose connectivity**

  If you automate the firewall configuration in an environment that includes multiple ESXi hosts, and run the ESXCLI command `esxcli network firewall unload` that destroys filters and unloads the firewall module, the hostd service fails and ESXi hosts lose connectivity.

  Workaround: Unloading the firewall module is not recommended at any time. If you must unload the firewall module, use the following steps:

  1. Stop the hostd service by using the command:
      `/etc/init.d/hostd stop.`
  2. Unload the firewall module by using the command:
      `esxcli network firewall unload.`
  3. Perform the required operations.
  4. Load the firewall module by using the command:
      `esxcli network firewall load.`
  5. Start the hostd service by using the command:
      `/etc/init.d/hostd start.`
* **vSphere Storage vMotion operations might fail in a vSAN environment due to an unauthenticated session of the Network File Copy (NFC) manager**

  Migrations to a vSAN datastore by using vSphere Storage vMotion of virtual machines that have at least one snapshot and more than one virtual disk with different storage policy might fail. The issue occurs due to an unauthenticated session of the NFC manager because the Simple Object Access Protocol (SOAP) body exceeds the allowed size.

  Workaround: First migrate the VM home namespace and just one of the virtual disks. After the operation completes, perform a disk only migration of the remaining 2 disks.
* **Changes in the properties and attributes of the devices and storage on an ESXi host might not persist after a reboot**

  If the device discovery routine during a reboot of an ESXi host times out, the jumpstart plug-in might not receive all configuration changes of the devices and storage from all the registered devices on the host. As a result, the process might restore the properties of some devices or storage to the default values after the reboot.

  Workaround: Manually restore the changes in the properties of the affected device or storage.
* **If you use a beta build of ESXi 7.0, ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen during some lifecycle operations**

  If you use a beta build of ESXi 7.0, ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen during some lifecycle operations such as unloading a driver or switching between ENS mode and native driver mode. For example, if you try to change the ENS mode, in the backtrace you see an error message similar to: `case ENS::INTERRUPT::NoVM_DeviceStateWithGracefulRemove hit BlueScreen: ASSERT bora/vmkernel/main/dlmalloc.c:2733` This issue is specific for beta builds and does not affect release builds such as ESXi 7.0.

  Workaround: Update to ESXi 7.0 GA.
* **vSAN secure disk wipe not supported on NVMe devices with multiple namespaces**

  If a NVME device has multiple namespaces configured, vSAN secure disk wipe operations are not supported.
   If a new namespace is configured while a secure wipe operation is in progress, for example in VMware Tanzu Architecture for Dell EMC VxRail or the Google Cloud Platform, the data on the newly added namespace might be erased, so vSAN secure disk wipe operations are supported only for NVME devices with a single namespace.

  Workaround: None
* **HTTP requests from certain libraries to vSphere might be rejected**

  The HTTP reverse proxy in vSphere 7.0 enforces stricter standard compliance than in previous releases. This might expose pre-existing problems in some third-party libraries used by applications for SOAP calls to vSphere.

  If you develop vSphere applications that use such libraries or include applications that rely on such libraries in your vSphere stack, you might experience connection issues when these libraries send HTTP requests to VMOMI. For example, HTTP requests issued from vijava libraries can take the following form:

  ```
  POST /sdk HTTP/1.1
  SOAPAction
  Content-Type: text/xml; charset=utf-8
  User-Agent: Java/1.8.0_221
  ```

  The syntax in this example violates an HTTP protocol header field requirement that mandates a colon after SOAPAction. Hence, the request is rejected in flight.

  Workaround: Developers leveraging noncompliant libraries in their applications can consider using a library that follows HTTP standards instead. For example, developers who use the vijava library can consider using the latest version of the yavijava library instead.
* **Editing an advanced options parameter in a host profile and setting a value to false, results in setting the value to true**

  When attempting to set a value to `false` for an advanced option parameter in a host profile, the user interface creates a non-empty string value. Values that are not empty are interpreted as `true` and the advanced option parameter receives a `true` value in the host profile.

  Workaround: There are two possible workarounds.

  + Set the advanced option parameter to `false` on a reference ESXi host and copy settings from this host in Host Profiles.
     Note: The host must be compliant with the host profile before modifying the advanced option parameter on the host.
  + Set the advanced option parameter to `false` on a reference ESXi host and create a host profile from this host. Then copy the host profile settings from the new host profile to the existing host profile.
* **You might see a dump file when using Broadcom driver lsi\_msgpt3, lsi\_msgpt35 and lsi\_mr3**

  When using the lsi\_msgpt3, lsi\_msgpt35 and lsi\_mr3 controllers, there is a potential risk to see dump file lsuv2-lsi-drivers-plugin-util-zdump. There is an issue when exiting the storelib used in this plugin utility. There is no impact on ESXi operations, you can ignore the dump file.

  Workaround: You can safely ignore this message. You can remove the lsuv2-lsi-drivers-plugin with the following command:

   `esxcli software vib remove -n lsuv2-lsiv2-drivers-plugin`
* **You might see reboot is not required after configuring SR-IOV of a PCI device in vCenter, but device configurations made by third party extensions might be lost and require reboot to be re-applied.**

  In ESXi 7.0, SR-IOV configuration is applied without a reboot and the device driver is reloaded. ESXi hosts might have third party extensions perform device configurations that need to run after the device driver is loaded during boot. A reboot is required for those third party extensions to re-apply the device configuration.

  Workaround: You must reboot after configuring SR-IOV to apply third party device configurations.

IMPORTANT:

To download the ESXi 7.0 Update 2e patch offline depot ZIP file from VMware Customer Connect, you must navigate to Products and Accounts > Product

Patches. From the Select a Product drop-down menu, select ESXi (Embedded and Installable) and from the Select a Version drop-down menu, select 7.0.

Starting with vSphere 7.0, VMware uses components for packaging VIBs along with bulletins. The ESXi and esx-update bulletins are dependent on each other.

Always include both in a single ESXi host patch baseline or include the rollup bulletin in the baseline to avoid failure during host patching.

When patching ESXi hosts by using VMware Update Manager from a version prior to ESXi 7.0 Update 2, it is strongly recommended to use the rollup bulletin in

the patch baseline. If you cannot use the rollup bulletin, be sure to include all of the following packages in the patching baseline. If the following packages are not

included in the baseline, the update operation fails:

VMware-vmkusb_0.1-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher

VMware-vmkata_0.1-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher

VMware-vmkfcoe_1.0.0.2-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher

VMware-NVMeoF-RDMA_1.0.1.2-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher

Rollup Bulletin

This rollup bulletin contains the latest VIBs with all the fixes after the initial release of ESXi 7.0.

Patch Download and Installation

In vSphere 7.0.x, the Update Manager plug-in, used for administering vSphere Update Manager, is replaced with the Lifecycle Manager plug-in. Administrative

operations for vSphere Update Manager are still available under the Lifecycle Manager plug-in, along with new capabilities for vSphere Lifecycle Manager.

The typical way to apply patches to ESXi 7.0.x hosts is by using the vSphere Lifecycle Manager. For details, see About vSphere Lifecycle Manager and vSphere

Lifecycle Manager Baselines and Images.

You can also update ESXi hosts without using the Lifecycle Manager plug-in, and use an image profile instead. To do this, you must manually download the patch

offline bundle ZIP file from the Product Patches page and use the esxcli software profile update command.

For more information, see the Upgrading Hosts by Using ESXCLI Commands and the VMware ESXi Upgrade guide.

CVE numbers

N/A

Updates esx-base, esx-update, vsan, and vsanhealth VIBs to resolve the following issues:

PR 2731317: During an USB passthrough, virtual machines might become unresponsive

If the USB device attached to an ESXi host has descriptors that are not compliant with the standard USB specifications, the virtual USB stack might fail to pass

through a USB device into a virtual machine. As a result, virtual machines become unresponsive, and you must either power off the virtual machine by using an

ESXCLI command, or restart the ESXi host.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2727062: Editing an advanced options parameter in a host profile and setting a value to false, results in setting the value to true

When attempting to set a value to false for an advanced option parameter in a host profile, the user interface creates a non-empty string value. Values that are

not empty are interpreted as true and the advanced option parameter receives a true value in the host profile.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2704831: After vSphere Replication appliance powers on, ESXi hosts intermittently lose connectivity to vCenter Server

A rare race condition with static map initialization might cause ESXi hosts to temporarily lose connectivity to vCenter Server after the vSphere Replication

appliance powers on. However, the hostd service automatically restarts and the ESXi hosts restore connectivity.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2764894: The hostd service might fail and ESXi hosts lose connectivity to vCenter Server due to an empty or unset property of a Virtual Infrastructure

Management (VIM) API array

In rare cases, an empty or unset property of a VIM API data array might cause the hostd service to fail. As a result, ESXi hosts lose connectivity to vCenter Server

and you must manually reconnect the hosts.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2720189: ESXi hosts intermittently fail with a BSVMM_Validate@vmkernel error in the backtrace

A rare error condition in the VMKernel might cause ESXi hosts to fail when powering on a virtual machine with more than 1 virtual CPU. A BSVMM_Validate@vmkernel

error is indicative for the problem.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2761940: An ESXi host might fail with a purple diagnostic screen due to locks during a vSphere vMotion operation

During a vSphere vMotion operation, if the calling context holds any locks, ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen and an error such as PSOD: Panic

at bora/vmkernel/core/lock.c:2070.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2757263: ESXi hosts fail with a purple diagnostic screen with a kernel context error, but not in the correct context

ESXi hosts might intermittently fail with a purple diagnostic screen with an error such as @BlueScreen: VERIFY bora/vmkernel/sched/cpusched.c that suggests a

preemption anomaly. However, the VMkernel preemption anomaly detection logic might fail to identify the correct kernel context and show a warning for the

wrong context.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix covers corner cases that might cause a preemption anomaly, such as when a system world exits while holding a

spinlock. The preemption anomaly detection warning remains @BlueScreen: VERIFY bora/vmkernel/sched/cpusched.c, but in the correct context.

PR 2752542: If you lower the value of the DiskMaxIOSize advanced config option, ESXi hosts I/O operations might fail

If you change the DiskMaxIOSize advanced config option to a lower value, I/Os with large block sizes might get incorrectly split and queue at the PSA path. As a

result, ESXi hosts I/O operations might time out and fail.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2772048: ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen due to a memory allocation failure in the vmkapi character device driver

Some poll requests might exceed the metadata heap of the vmkapi character device driver and cause ESXi hosts to fail with a purple diagnostic screen and an

error such as:

#PF Exception 14 in world 2099138:IPMI Response IP 0x41800b922ab0 addr 0x18 PTEs:0x0;

In the VMkernel logs, you might see messages such as:

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2741112: Failure of some Intel CPUs to forward Debug Exception (#DB) traps might result in virtual machine triple fault

In rare cases, some Intel CPUs might fail to forward #DB traps and if a timer interrupt happens during the Windows system call, virtual machine might triple fault.

In the vmware.log file, you see an error such as msg.monitorEvent.tripleFault. This issue is not consistent and virtual machines that consistently triple fault or triple

fault after boot are impacted by another issue.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix forwards all #DB traps from CPUs into the guest operating system, except when the DB trap comes from a debugger

that is attached to the virtual machine.

PR 2786864: An ESXi host fails with a purple diagnostic screen due to a call stack corruption in the ESXi storage stack

While handling the SCSI command READ CAPACITY (10), ESXi might copy excess data from the response and corrupt the call stack. As a result, the ESXi host fails

with a purple diagnostic screen.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2725025: You see alarms that a NIC link is down even after the uplink is restored

If you plug in and out a physical NIC in your vCenter Sever system, after the uplink is restored, you still see an alarm in the vSphere Client or the vSphere Web

Client that a NIC link on some ESXi hosts is down. The VOBD daemon might not create the event esx.clear.net.redundancy.restored to remove such alarms, which

causes the issue.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2776791: ESXi installation by using a ks.cfg installation script and a USB or SD booting device might fail

In some cases, when multiple USB or SD devices with different file systems are connected to your vCenter Server system, ESXi installation by using a ks.cfg

installation script and a USB or SD booting device might fail.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix logs an exception and allows the installation to continue, instead of failing.

PR 2724166: You might see higher than configured rate of automatic unmap operations on a newly mounted VMFS6 volumes

In the first minutes after mounting a VMFS6 volume, you might see higher than configured rate of automatic unmap operations. For example, if you set the

unmap bandwidth to 2000 MB/s, you see unmap operations running at more than 3000 MB/s.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2790353: Old data on an independent nonpersistent mode virtual disk remains after a virtual machine reset

For independent nonpersistent mode virtual disks, all writes are stored in a redo log, which is a temporary file with extension .REDO_XXXXXX in the VM directory.

However, a reset of a virtual machine does not clear the old redo log on such disks.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2787866: A replay of a pre-recorded support bundle by using the esxtop utility might fail with a segmentation fault

When you run the esxtop utility by using the ESXi Shell to replay a pre-recorded support bundle, the operation might fail with a segmentation fault.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure all local variables of the esxtop utility are initialized properly.

PR 2790502: Shutdown or reboot of ESXi hosts takes very long

Rarely, in certain configurations, the shutdown or reboot of ESXi hosts might stop at the step Shutting down device drivers for a long time, in the order of 20

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2834968: Virtual machines fail with a message for too many sticky pages

The virtual network adapter VMXNET Generation 3 (VMXNET3) uses buffers to process rx packets. Such buffers are either pre-pinned or pinned and mapped

during runtime. In rare occasions, some buffers might not un-pin and get re-pinned later, resulting in a higher-than-expected pin count of such a buffer. As a

result, virtual machines might fail with an error such as MONITOR PANIC: vmk: vcpu-0:Too many sticky pages..

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2832090: ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen when vSphere Replication is enabled due to a rare lock rank violation

Due to a rare lock rank violation in the vSphere Replication I/O filter, some ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen when vSphere Replication is

enabled. You see an error such as VERIFY bora/vmkernel/main/bh.c:978 on the screen.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2841163: You see packet drops for virtual machines with VMware Network Extensibility (NetX) redirection enabled

In vCenter Server advanced performance charts, you see an increasing number of packet drop count for all virtual machines that have NetX redirection enabled.

However, if you disable NetX redirection, the count becomes 0.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2804742: A virtual switch might drop IGMPv3 SSM specific queries during snooping

Virtual switches processing IGMPv3 SSM specific queries might drop some queries when an IP is not included in the list of available ports as a result of the source

PR 2793380: ESXi hosts become unresponsive when you power on a virtual machine

In particular circumstances, when you power on a virtual machine with a corrupted VMware Tools manifest file, the hostd service might fail. As a result, the ESXi

host becomes unresponsive. You can backtrace the issue in the hostd dump file that is usually generated in such cases at the time a VM is powered on.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2813328: Encrypted virtual machines do not auto power on even when the Start delay option is configured

After a reboot of an ESXi host, encrypted virtual machines might not auto power on even when Autostart is configured with the Start delay option to set a

specific start time of the host. The issue affects only encrypted virtual machines due to a delay in the distribution of keys from standard key providers.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that the Start delay option for encrypted VMs considers the delay for getting a key after an ESXi host

reboot.

PR 2792504: Disabling the SLP service might cause failures during operations with host profiles

When the SLP service is disabled to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, the sfcbd-watchdog service might remain enabled and cause compliance check

ESXi updates and upgrades might fail on Mac Pro servers with a purple diagnostic screen and a message such as PSOD - NOT IMPLEMENTED

bora/vmkernel/hardware/pci/bridge.c:372 PCPU0:2097152/bootstrap. The issue occurs when Mac Pro BIOS does not assign resources to some devices.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2731139: Packets with "IPv6 Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option" are lost in traffic between virtual machines with ENS enabled

Some Linux kernels add the IPv6 Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option to IPv6 tunnel packets as described in the RFC 2473, par. 5.1. As a result, IPv6 tunnel packets

are dropped in traffic between virtual machines with ENS enabled, because of the IPv6 extension header.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix is to correctly parse packets with the IPv6 Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option enabled.

PR 2733489: Taking a snapshot of a large virtual machine on a large VMFS6 datastore might take long

Resource allocation for a delta disk to create a snapshot of a large virtual machine, with virtual disks equal to or exceeding 1TB, on large VMFS6 datastores of

30TB or more, might take significant time. As a result, the virtual machine might temporarily lose connectivity. The issue affects primarily VMFS6 filesystems.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2755232: An ESXi host might not discover devices configured with the VMW_SATP_INV plug-in

In case of temporary connectivity issues, ESXi hosts might not discover devices configured with the VMW_SATP_INV plug-in after connectivity restores, because SCSI

commands that fail during the device discovery stage cause an out-of-memory condition for the plug-in.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2761131: If you import virtual machines with a virtual USB device to a vCenter Server system, the virtual machines might fail to power on

If you import a virtual machine with a virtual USB device that is not supported by vCenter Server, such as a virtual USB camera, to a vCenter Server system, the

VM might fail to power on. The start of such virtual machines fails with an error message similar to: PANIC: Unexpected signal: 11. The issue affects mostly VM

import operations from VMware Fusion or VMware Workstation systems, which support a wide range of virtual USB devices.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix ignores any unsupported virtual USB devices in virtual machines imported to a vCenter Server system.

PR 2763933: In the vmkernel.log, you see an error for an unexpected result while waiting for pointer block cluster (PBC) to clear

A non-blocking I/O operation might block a PBC file operation in a VMFS volume. In the vmkernel.log, you see an error such as:

cpu2:2098100)WARNING: PB3: 5020: Unexpected result (Would block) while waiting for PBC to clear -FD c63 r24

However, this is expected behavior.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix removes the error message in cases when an I/O operation blocks a PBC file operation.

PR 2766401: When an overlay tunnel is configured from a guest VM with different default VXLAN port than 4789, vmxnet3 might drop packets

By default, the vmxnet3 driver uses port 4789 when a VM uses ENS and port 8472 when ENS is not enabled. As a result, when an overlay tunnel is configured

from a guest VM with different default VXLAN port, vmxnet3 might drop packets.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure vmxnet3 delivers packets when a VM uses either of ports 4789 or 8472. However, the fix works only on

VMs with version ESXi 6.7 and later, hardware versions later than 14, and if the overlay tunnel is configured from a guest VM.

PR 2744211: A static MAC cannot be learned on another VNIC port across a different VLAN

In some cases, MAC learning does not work as expected and affects some virtual machine operations. For example, cloning a VM with the same MAC address on

a different VLAN causes a traffic flood to the cloned VM in the ESXi host where the original VM is present.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that a static MAC can be learned on another port, on a different VLAN. For example, a static MAC x on

VNIC port p1 with on VLAN 1, can be learned on VNIC port p2, VLAN 2.

PR 2771730: You cannot create a vCenter Host Profiles CIM Indication Subscription due to an out of memory error

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes the Network I/O Control queue size dynamic to allow expansion under certain conditions.

PR 2839716: You cannot add Intel Ice Lake servers to a Skylake cluster with enabled Enhanced vMotion Compatibility (EVC) mode

In a vSphere 6.7.x system, you cannot add an Intel Ice Lake server to a Skylake cluster with enabled EVC mode. In the vSphere Web Client or the vSphere Client,

you see the following message:

Host CPU lacks features required by that mode. XSAVE of BND0-BND3 bounds registers (BNDREGS) is unsupported. XSAVE of BNDCFGU and BNDSTATUS registers (BNDCSR)

is unsupported.

This issue is resolved in this release. You can update your ESXi hosts to ESXi 670-202111001, or upgrade to ESXi 7.0.x.

PR 2847812: Active Directory latency issues might impact performance across the entire vCenter Server system

The VIM API server deletes the Active Directory cache on certain intervals to check the validity of permissions of Active Directory domain accounts. After the

cache delete operation, daily by default, the VIM API server re-populates the cache. However, the cache re-populate operation might be slow on domains with

many accounts. As a result, such operations might impact performance across the entire vCenter Server system.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix skips the step of re-populating the cache.

PR 2726678: ESXi hosts might become unresponsive after an abrupt power cycling or reboot

An abrupt power cycling or reboot of an ESX host might cause a race between subsequent journal replays because other hosts might try to access the same

resources. If a race condition happens, the journal replay cannot complete. As a result, virtual machines on a VMFS6 datastore become inaccessible or any

operations running on the VMs fail or stop.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix enhances local and remote journal replay for VMFS6.

PR 2789302: Multiple cron instances run after using the reboot_helper.py script to shut down a vSAN cluster

If you manually run the reboot_helper.py script to shut down a vSAN cluster, the process cleans unused cron jobs registered during the shutdown. However, the

script might start a new cron instance instead of restarting the cron daemon after cleaning the unused cron jobs. As a result, multiple cron instances might

accumulate and you see cron jobs executed multiple times.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2750034: The hostd service might fail with a “Memory exceeds hard limit” error due to a memory leak

If you run a recursive call on a large datastore, such as DatastoreBrowser::SearchSubFolders, a memory leak condition might cause the hostd service to fail with an

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2857511: Virtual machines appear as inaccessible in the vSphere Client and you might see some downtime for applications

In rare cases, hardware issues might cause an SQlite DB corruption that makes multiple VMs become inaccessible and lead to some downtime for applications.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2847091: Hosts in a vSAN cluster might fail due to a memory block attributes issue

When a vSAN host has memory pressure, adding disks to a disk group might cause failure of the memory block attributes (blkAttr) component initialization.

Without the blkAttr component, commit and flush tasks stop, which causes log entries to build up in the SSD and eventually cause а congestion. As a result, a

NMI failure might occur due to the CPU load for processing the large number of log entries.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2765679: Cannot add hosts to a vSAN cluster with large cluster support enabled

In some cases, the host designated as the leader cannot send heartbeat messages to other hosts in a large vSAN cluster. This issue occurs when the leader uses

an insufficient size of the TX buffer. The result is that new hosts cannot join the cluster with large cluster support (up to 64 hosts) enabled.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2731643: You see memory congestion on vSAN cluster hosts with large number of idle VMs

On a vSAN cluster with a large number of idle virtual machines, vSAN hosts might experience memory congestion due to higher scrub frequency.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2774667: vSAN automatic rebalance does not occur even after capacity reaches 80%

An issue with trim space operations count might cause a large number of pending delete operations in vSAN. If an automatic rebalancing operation triggers, it

cannot progress due to such pending delete operations. For example, if you set the rebalancing threshold at 30%, you do not see any  progress on rebalancing

even when the storage capacity reaches 80%.

This issue is resolved in this release.

PR 2778008: ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen due to a lock spinout on a virtual machine configured to use persistent Memory (PMem)

with large number of vCPUs

Due to a dependency between the management of virtual RAM and virtual NVDIMM within a virtual machine, excessive access to the virtual NVDIMM device

might lead to a lock spinout while accessing virtual RAM and cause the ESXi host to fail with a purple diagnostic screen. In the backtrace, you see the following:

PR 2833428: ESXi hosts with virtual machines with Latency Sensitivity enabled might randomly become unresponsive due to CPU starvation

When you enable Latency Sensitivity on virtual machines, some threads of the Likewise Service Manager (lwsmd), which sets CPU affinity explicitly, might

compete for CPU resources on such virtual machines. As a result, you might see the ESXi host and the hostd service to become unresponsive.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure lwsmd does not set CPU affinity explicitly.

PR 2835990: Adding ESXi hosts to an Active Directory domain might take long

Some LDAP queries that have no specified timeouts might cause a significant delay in domain join operations for adding an ESXi host to an Active Directory

domain.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix adds a 15 seconds standard timeout with additional logging around the LDAP calls during domain join workflow.

PR 2852099: When vSphere Replication is enabled on a virtual machine, many other VMs might become unresponsive

When vSphere Replication is enabled on a virtual machine, you might see higher datastore and in-guest latencies that in certain cases might lead to ESXi hosts

becoming unresponsive to vCenter Server. The increased latency comes from vSphere Replication computing MD5 checksums on the I/O completion path, which

delays all other I/Os.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix offloads the vSphere Replication MD5 calculation from the I/O completion path to a work pool and reduces the

amount of outstanding I/O that vSphere Replication issues.

PR 2761169: Connection to the /bootbank partition intermittently breaks when you use USB or SD devices

ESXi670-202111001 adds two fixes to the USB host controller for cases when a USB or SD device lose connectivity to the /bootbank partition:

1. Adds a parameter usbStorageRegisterDelaySecs.

The usbStorageRegisterDelaySecs parameter is part of the vmkusb module and it delays to register cached USB storage device within the limit of 0 to 600

seconds. The default delay is 10 seconds. The parametric delay makes sure that if the USB host controller disconnects from your vSphere system and any

resource on the device, such as dump files, is still in use by ESXi, the USB or SD device does not get a new path that might break connection to the

/bootbank partition or corrupt the VMFS-L LOCKER partition.

2. Enhances the USB host controller driver to tolerate command timeout failures.

In cases when a device, such as Dell IDSDM, reconnects by a hardware signal, or a USB device resets due to a heavy workload, the USB host controller

driver might make only one retry to restore connectivity. With the fix, the controller makes multiple retries and extends tolerance to timeout failures.

This issue is resolved in this release. As a best practice, do not set dump partition on USB storage device and do not set USB devices under a heavy workload.

N/A

This patch resolves the following issues:

If the USB device attached to an ESXi host has descriptors that are not compliant with the standard USB specifications, the virtual USB stack might fail to pass

through a USB device into a virtual machine. As a result, virtual machines become unresponsive, and you must either power off the virtual machine by using an

ESXCLI command, or restart the ESXi host.

When attempting to set a value to false for an advanced option parameter in a host profile, the user interface creates a non-empty string value. Values that

are not empty are interpreted as true and the advanced option parameter receives a true value in the host profile.

A rare race condition with static map initialization might cause ESXi hosts to temporarily lose connectivity to vCenter Server after the vSphere Replication

appliance powers on. However, the hostd service automatically restarts and the ESXi hosts restore connectivity.

In rare cases, an empty or unset property of a VIM API data array might cause the hostd service to fail. As a result, ESXi hosts lose connectivity to vCenter

Server and you must manually reconnect the hosts.

A rare error condition in the VMKernel might cause ESXi hosts to fail when powering on a virtual machine with more than 1 virtual CPU.

A BSVMM_Validate@vmkernel error is indicative for the problem.

During a vSphere vMotion operation, if the calling context holds any locks, ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen and an error such as PSOD:

Panic at bora/vmkernel/core/lock.c:2070.

ESXi hosts might intermittently fail with a purple diagnostic screen with an error such as @BlueScreen: VERIFY bora/vmkernel/sched/cpusched.c that suggests a

preemption anomaly. However, the VMkernel preemption anomaly detection logic might fail to identify the correct kernel context and show a warning for the

wrong context.

If you change the DiskMaxIOSize advanced config option to a lower value, I/Os with large block sizes might get incorrectly split and queue at the PSA path. As a

result, ESXi hosts I/O operations might time out and fail.

Some poll requests might exceed the metadata heap of the vmkapi character device driver and cause ESXi hosts to fail with a purple diagnostic screen and an

error such as:

#PF Exception 14 in world 2099138:IPMI Response IP 0x41800b922ab0 addr 0x18 PTEs:0x0;

In the VMkernel logs, you might see messages such as:

WARNING: Heap: 3571: Heap VMKAPI-char-metadata already at its maximum size. Cannot expand.

and

WARNING: Heap: 4079: Heap_Align(VMKAPI-char-metadata, 40/40 bytes, 8 align) failed. caller: 0x418029922489

In rare cases, some Intel CPUs might fail to forward #DB traps and if a timer interrupt happens during the Windows system call, virtual machine might triple

fault. In the vmware.log file, you see an error such as msg.monitorEvent.tripleFault. This issue is not consistent and virtual machines that consistently triple fault

or triple fault after boot are impacted by another issue.

While handling the SCSI command READ CAPACITY (10), ESXi might copy excess data from the response and corrupt the call stack. As a result, the ESXi host fails

with a purple diagnostic screen.

If you plug in and out a physical NIC in your vCenter Sever system, after the uplink is restored, you still see an alarm in the vmkernel.log of some ESXi hosts that

a NIC link is down. The VOBD daemon might not create the event esx.clear.net.redundancy.restored to remove such alarms, which causes the issue.

In some cases, when multiple USB or SD devices with different file systems are connected to your vCenter Server system, ESXi installation by using a ks.cfg

installation script and a USB or SD booting device might fail.

In the first minutes after mounting a VMFS6 volume, you might see higher than configured rate of automatic unmap operations. For example, if you set the

unmap bandwidth to 2000 MB/s, you see unmap operations running at more than 3000 MB/s.

For independent nonpersistent mode virtual disks, all writes are stored in a redo log, which is a temporary file with extension .REDO_XXXXXX in the VM directory.

However, a reset of a virtual machine does not clear the old redo log on such disks.

When you run the esxtop utility by using the ESXi Shell to replay a pre-recorded support bundle, the operation might fail with a segmentation fault.

Rarely, in certain configurations, the shutdown or reboot of ESXi hosts might stop at the step Shutting down device drivers for a long time, in the order of 20

minutes, but the operation eventually completes.

The virtual network adapter VMXNET Generation 3 (VMXNET3) uses buffers to process rx packets. Such buffers are either pre-pinned or pinned and mapped

during runtime. In rare occasions, some buffers might not un-pin and get re-pinned later, resulting in a higher-than-expected pin count of such a buffer. As a

result, virtual machines might fail with an error such as MONITOR PANIC: vmk: vcpu-0:Too many sticky pages..

Due to a rare lock rank violation in the vSphere Replication I/O filter, some ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen when vSphere Replication is

enabled. You see an error such as VERIFY bora/vmkernel/main/bh.c:978 on the screen.

In vCenter Server advanced performance charts, you see an increasing number of packet drop count for all virtual machines that have NetX redirection

enabled. However, if you disable NetX redirection, the count becomes 0.

Virtual switches processing IGMPv3 SSM specific queries might drop some queries when an IP is not included in the list of available ports as a result of the

source IP check.

An integer overflow bug might cause vSAN DOM to issue scrubs more frequently than the configured setting.

In particular circumstances, when you power on a virtual machine with a corrupted VMware Tools manifest file, the hostd service might fail. As a result, the

ESXi host becomes unresponsive. You can backtrace the issue in the hostd dump file that is usually generated in such cases at the time a VM is powered on.

After a reboot of an ESXi host, encrypted virtual machines might not auto power on even when Autostart is configured with the Start delay option to set a

specific start time of the host. The issue affects only encrypted virtual machines due to a delay in the distribution of keys from standard key providers.

When the SLP service is disabled to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, the sfcbd-watchdog service might remain enabled and cause compliance check

failures when you perform updates by using a host profile.

When an ESXi 6.7.x host has more than 120 VMs on it, vSphere vMotion operations to that host or from that host might become slow or occasionally fail.

In certain environments, vSphere Client might not fully protect the underlying websites through modern browser security mechanisms.

ESXi updates and upgrades might fail on Mac Pro servers with a purple diagnostic screen and a message such as PSOD - NOT IMPLEMENTED

bora/vmkernel/hardware/pci/bridge.c:372 PCPU0:2097152/bootstrap. The issue occurs when Mac Pro BIOS does not assign resources to some devices.

Some Linux kernels add the IPv6 Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option to IPv6 tunnel packets as described in the RFC 2473, par. 5.1. As a result, IPv6 tunnel

packets are dropped in traffic between virtual machines with ENS enabled, because of the IPv6 extension header.

Resource allocation for a delta disk to create a snapshot of a large virtual machine, with virtual disks equal to or exceeding 1TB, on large VMFS6 datastores of

30TB or more, might take significant time. As a result, the virtual machine might temporarily lose connectivity. The issue affects primarily VMFS6 filesystems.

In case of temporary connectivity issues, ESXi hosts might not discover devices configured with the VMW_SATP_INV plug-in after connectivity restores, because

SCSI commands that fail during the device discovery stage cause an out-of-memory condition for the plug-in.

If you import a virtual machine with a virtual USB device that is not supported by vCenter Server, such as a virtual USB camera, to a vCenter Server system,

the VM might fail to power on. The start of such virtual machines fails with an error message similar to: PANIC: Unexpected signal: 11. The issue affects mostly

VM import operations from VMware Fusion or VMware Workstation systems, which support a wide range of virtual USB devices.

A non-blocking I/O operation might block a PBC file operation in a VMFS volume. In the vmkernel.log, you see an error such as:

cpu2:2098100)WARNING: PB3: 5020: Unexpected result (Would block) while waiting for PBC to clear -FD c63 r24

However, this is expected behavior.

By default, the vmxnet3 driver uses port 4789 when a VM uses ENS and port 8472 when ENS is not enabled. As a result, when an overlay tunnel is configured

from a guest VM with different default VXLAN port, vmxnet3 might drop packets.

In some cases, MAC learning does not work as expected and affects some virtual machine operations. For example, cloning a VM with the same MAC address

on a different VLAN causes a traffic flood to the cloned VM in the ESXi host where the original VM is present.

Attempts to create a vCenter Host Profiles CIM Indication Subscription might fail due to a cim-xml parsing request that returns an out of memory error.

The packet scheduler that controls network I/O in a vCenter Server system has a fixed length queue that might quickly fill up. As a result, you might see packet

drops on uplink on heavy traffic.

In a vSphere 6.7.x system, you cannot add an Intel Ice Lake server to a Skylake cluster with enabled EVC mode. In the vSphere Web Client or the vSphere

Client, you see the following message:

Host CPU lacks features required by that mode. XSAVE of BND0-BND3 bounds registers (BNDREGS) is unsupported. XSAVE of BNDCFGU and BNDSTATUS registers (BNDCSR)

is unsupported.

The VIM API server deletes the Active Directory cache on certain intervals to check the validity of permissions of Active Directory domain accounts. After the

cache delete operation, daily by default, the VIM API server re-populates the cache. However, the cache re-populate operation might be slow on domains with

many accounts. As a result, such operations might impact performance across the entire vCenter Server system.

An abrupt power cycling or reboot of an ESX host might cause a race between subsequent journal replays because other hosts might try to access the same

resources. If a race condition happens, the journal replay cannot complete. As a result, virtual machines on a VMFS6 datastore become inaccessible or any

operations running on the VMs fail or stop.

If you manually run the reboot_helper.py script to shut down a vSAN cluster, the process cleans unused cron jobs registered during the shutdown. However, the

script might start a new cron instance instead of restarting the cron daemon after cleaning the unused cron jobs. As a result, multiple cron instances might

accumulate and you see cron jobs executed multiple times.

If you run a recursive call on a large datastore, such as DatastoreBrowser::SearchSubFolders, a memory leak condition might cause the hostd service to fail with

an out-of-memory error.

When you enable encryption for a vSAN cluster with a Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) provider, the following health check might report

status errors: vCenter KMS status.

For all-flash vSAN configurations, you might see larger than required recommended size for the core dump partition. As a result, the core dump configuration

check might fail.

In rare cases, hardware issues might cause an SQlite DB corruption that makes multiple VMs become inaccessible and lead to some downtime for applications.

When a vSAN host has memory pressure, adding disks to a disk group might cause failure of the memory block attributes (blkAttr) component initialization.

Without the blkAttr component, commit and flush tasks stop, which causes log entries to build up in the SSD and eventually cause а congestion. As a result, a

NMI failure might occur due to the CPU load for processing the large number of log entries.

In some cases, the host designated as the leader cannot send heartbeat messages to other hosts in a large vSAN cluster. This issue occurs when the leader

uses an insufficient size of the TX buffer. The result is that new hosts cannot join the cluster with large cluster support (up to 64 hosts) enabled.

On a vSAN cluster with a large number of idle virtual machines, vSAN hosts might experience memory congestion due to higher scrub frequency.

An issue with trim space operations count might cause a large number of pending delete operations in vSAN. If an automatic rebalancing operation triggers, it

cannot progress due to such pending delete operations. For example, if you set the rebalancing threshold at 30%, you do not see any  progress on

rebalancing even when the storage capacity reaches 80%.

Due to a dependency between the management of virtual RAM and virtual NVDIMM within a virtual machine, excessive access to the virtual NVDIMM device

might lead to a lock spinout while accessing virtual RAM and cause the ESXi host to fail with a purple diagnostic screen. In the backtrace, you see the

following:

SP_WaitLock

SPLockWork

AsyncRemapPrepareRemapListVM

AsyncRemap_AddOrRemapVM

LPageSelectLPageToDefrag

VmAssistantProcessTasks

When you enable Latency Sensitivity on virtual machines, some threads of the Likewise Service Manager (lwsmd), which sets CPU affinity explicitly, might

compete for CPU resources on such virtual machines. As a result, you might see the ESXi host and the hostd service to become unresponsive.

ESXi670-202111001 adds two fixes to the USB host controller for cases when a USB or SD device lose connectivity to the /bootbank partition:

1. Adds a parameter usbStorageRegisterDelaySecs.

The usbStorageRegisterDelaySecs parameter is part of the vmkusb module and it delays to register cached USB storage device within the limit of 0 to 600

seconds. The default delay is 10 seconds. The parametric delay makes sure that if the USB host controller disconnects from your vSphere system and

any resource on the device, such as dump files, is still in use by ESXi, the USB or SD device does not get a new path that might break connection to

the /bootbank partition or corrupt the VMFS-L LOCKER partition.

2. Enhances the USB host controller driver to tolerate command timeout failures.

In cases when a device, such as Dell IDSDM, reconnects by a hardware signal, or a USB device resets due to a heavy workload, the USB host controller

driver might make only one retry to restore connectivity. With the fix, the controller makes multiple retries and extends tolerance to timeout failures.

Some LDAP queries that have no specified timeouts might cause a significant delay in domain join operations for adding an ESXi host to an Active Directory

domain.

After an upgrade of the brcmfcoe driver on Hitachi storage arrays, ESXi hosts might fail to boot and lose connectivity.

The OEM smartpqi driver in ESXi 670-202111001 uses a new logical LUN ID assignment rule to become compatible with the drivers of versions later than

1.0.3.2323. As a result, OEM smartpqi drivers of version 1.0.3.2323 and earlier might fail to blink LEDs or get the physical locations on logical drives.

When vSphere Replication is enabled on a virtual machine, you might see higher datastore and in-guest latencies that in certain cases might lead to ESXi hosts

becoming unresponsive to vCenter Server. The increased latency comes from vSphere Replication computing MD5 checksums on the I/O completion path,

which delays all other I/Os.

N/A

This patch resolves the following issues:

If the USB device attached to an ESXi host has descriptors that are not compliant with the standard USB specifications, the virtual USB stack might fail to pass

through a USB device into a virtual machine. As a result, virtual machines become unresponsive, and you must either power off the virtual machine by using an

ESXCLI command, or restart the ESXi host.

When attempting to set a value to false for an advanced option parameter in a host profile, the user interface creates a non-empty string value. Values that

are not empty are interpreted as true and the advanced option parameter receives a true value in the host profile.

A rare race condition with static map initialization might cause ESXi hosts to temporarily lose connectivity to vCenter Server after the vSphere Replication

appliance powers on. However, the hostd service automatically restarts and the ESXi hosts restore connectivity.

In rare cases, an empty or unset property of a VIM API data array might cause the hostd service to fail. As a result, ESXi hosts lose connectivity to vCenter

Server and you must manually reconnect the hosts.

A rare error condition in the VMKernel might cause ESXi hosts to fail when powering on a virtual machine with more than 1 virtual CPU.

A BSVMM_Validate@vmkernel error is indicative for the problem.

During a vSphere vMotion operation, if the calling context holds any locks, ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen and an error such as PSOD:

Panic at bora/vmkernel/core/lock.c:2070.

ESXi hosts might intermittently fail with a purple diagnostic screen with an error such as @BlueScreen: VERIFY bora/vmkernel/sched/cpusched.c that suggests a

preemption anomaly. However, the VMkernel preemption anomaly detection logic might fail to identify the correct kernel context and show a warning for the

wrong context.

If you change the DiskMaxIOSize advanced config option to a lower value, I/Os with large block sizes might get incorrectly split and queue at the PSA path. As a

result, ESXi hosts I/O operations might time out and fail.

Some poll requests might exceed the metadata heap of the vmkapi character device driver and cause ESXi hosts to fail with a purple diagnostic screen and an

error such as:

#PF Exception 14 in world 2099138:IPMI Response IP 0x41800b922ab0 addr 0x18 PTEs:0x0;

In the VMkernel logs, you might see messages such as:

WARNING: Heap: 3571: Heap VMKAPI-char-metadata already at its maximum size. Cannot expand.

and

WARNING: Heap: 4079: Heap_Align(VMKAPI-char-metadata, 40/40 bytes, 8 align) failed. caller: 0x418029922489

In rare cases, some Intel CPUs might fail to forward #DB traps and if a timer interrupt happens during the Windows system call, virtual machine might triple

fault. In the vmware.log file, you see an error such as msg.monitorEvent.tripleFault. This issue is not consistent and virtual machines that consistently triple fault

or triple fault after boot are impacted by another issue.

While handling the SCSI command READ CAPACITY (10), ESXi might copy excess data from the response and corrupt the call stack. As a result, the ESXi host fails

with a purple diagnostic screen.

If you plug in and out a physical NIC in your vCenter Sever system, after the uplink is restored, you still see an alarm in the vmkernel.log of some ESXi hosts that

a NIC link is down. The VOBD daemon might not create the event esx.clear.net.redundancy.restored to remove such alarms, which causes the issue.

In some cases, when multiple USB or SD devices with different file systems are connected to your vCenter Server system, ESXi installation by using a ks.cfg

installation script and a USB or SD booting device might fail.

In the first minutes after mounting a VMFS6 volume, you might see higher than configured rate of automatic unmap operations. For example, if you set the

unmap bandwidth to 2000 MB/s, you see unmap operations running at more than 3000 MB/s.

For independent nonpersistent mode virtual disks, all writes are stored in a redo log, which is a temporary file with extension .REDO_XXXXXX in the VM directory.

However, a reset of a virtual machine does not clear the old redo log on such disks.

When you run the esxtop utility by using the ESXi Shell to replay a pre-recorded support bundle, the operation might fail with a segmentation fault.

Rarely, in certain configurations, the shutdown or reboot of ESXi hosts might stop at the step Shutting down device drivers for a long time, in the order of 20

minutes, but the operation eventually completes.

The virtual network adapter VMXNET Generation 3 (VMXNET3) uses buffers to process rx packets. Such buffers are either pre-pinned or pinned and mapped

during runtime. In rare occasions, some buffers might not un-pin and get re-pinned later, resulting in a higher-than-expected pin count of such a buffer. As a

result, virtual machines might fail with an error such as MONITOR PANIC: vmk: vcpu-0:Too many sticky pages..

Due to a rare lock rank violation in the vSphere Replication I/O filter, some ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen when vSphere Replication is

enabled. You see an error such as VERIFY bora/vmkernel/main/bh.c:978 on the screen.

In vCenter Server advanced performance charts, you see an increasing number of packet drop count for all virtual machines that have NetX redirection

enabled. However, if you disable NetX redirection, the count becomes 0.

Virtual switches processing IGMPv3 SSM specific queries might drop some queries when an IP is not included in the list of available ports as a result of the

source IP check.

An integer overflow bug might cause vSAN DOM to issue scrubs more frequently than the configured setting.

In particular circumstances, when you power on a virtual machine with a corrupted VMware Tools manifest file, the hostd service might fail. As a result, the

ESXi host becomes unresponsive. You can backtrace the issue in the hostd dump file that is usually generated in such cases at the time a VM is powered on.

After a reboot of an ESXi host, encrypted virtual machines might not auto power on even when Autostart is configured with the Start delay option to set a

specific start time of the host. The issue affects only encrypted virtual machines due to a delay in the distribution of keys from standard key providers.

When the SLP service is disabled to prevent potential security vulnerabilities, the sfcbd-watchdog service might remain enabled and cause compliance check

failures when you perform updates by using a host profile.

When an ESXi 6.7.x host has more than 120 VMs on it, vSphere vMotion operations to that host or from that host might become slow or occasionally fail.

In certain environments, vSphere Client might not fully protect the underlying websites through modern browser security mechanisms.

ESXi updates and upgrades might fail on Mac Pro servers with a purple diagnostic screen and a message such as PSOD - NOT IMPLEMENTED

bora/vmkernel/hardware/pci/bridge.c:372 PCPU0:2097152/bootstrap. The issue occurs when Mac Pro BIOS does not assign resources to some devices.

Some Linux kernels add the IPv6 Tunnel Encapsulation Limit option to IPv6 tunnel packets as described in the RFC 2473, par. 5.1. As a result, IPv6 tunnel

packets are dropped in traffic between virtual machines with ENS enabled, because of the IPv6 extension header.

Resource allocation for a delta disk to create a snapshot of a large virtual machine, with virtual disks equal to or exceeding 1TB, on large VMFS6 datastores of

30TB or more, might take significant time. As a result, the virtual machine might temporarily lose connectivity. The issue affects primarily VMFS6 filesystems.

In case of temporary connectivity issues, ESXi hosts might not discover devices configured with the VMW_SATP_INV plug-in after connectivity restores, because

SCSI commands that fail during the device discovery stage cause an out-of-memory condition for the plug-in.

If you import a virtual machine with a virtual USB device that is not supported by vCenter Server, such as a virtual USB camera, to a vCenter Server system,

the VM might fail to power on. The start of such virtual machines fails with an error message similar to: PANIC: Unexpected signal: 11. The issue affects mostly

VM import operations from VMware Fusion or VMware Workstation systems, which support a wide range of virtual USB devices.

A non-blocking I/O operation might block a PBC file operation in a VMFS volume. In the vmkernel.log, you see an error such as:

cpu2:2098100)WARNING: PB3: 5020: Unexpected result (Would block) while waiting for PBC to clear -FD c63 r24

However, this is expected behavior.

By default, the vmxnet3 driver uses port 4789 when a VM uses ENS and port 8472 when ENS is not enabled. As a result, when an overlay tunnel is configured

from a guest VM with different default VXLAN port, vmxnet3 might drop packets.

In some cases, MAC learning does not work as expected and affects some virtual machine operations. For example, cloning a VM with the same MAC address

on a different VLAN causes a traffic flood to the cloned VM in the ESXi host where the original VM is present.

Attempts to create a vCenter Host Profiles CIM Indication Subscription might fail due to a cim-xml parsing request that returns an out of memory error.

The packet scheduler that controls network I/O in a vCenter Server system has a fixed length queue that might quickly fill up. As a result, you might see packet

drops on uplink on heavy traffic.

In a vSphere 6.7.x system, you cannot add an Intel Ice Lake server to a Skylake cluster with enabled EVC mode. In the vSphere Web Client or the vSphere

Client, you see the following message:

Host CPU lacks features required by that mode. XSAVE of BND0-BND3 bounds registers (BNDREGS) is unsupported. XSAVE of BNDCFGU and BNDSTATUS registers (BNDCSR)

is unsupported.

The VIM API server deletes the Active Directory cache on certain intervals to check the validity of permissions of Active Directory domain accounts. After the

cache delete operation, daily by default, the VIM API server re-populates the cache. However, the cache re-populate operation might be slow on domains with

many accounts. As a result, such operations might impact performance across the entire vCenter Server system.

An abrupt power cycling or reboot of an ESX host might cause a race between subsequent journal replays because other hosts might try to access the same

resources. If a race condition happens, the journal replay cannot complete. As a result, virtual machines on a VMFS6 datastore become inaccessible or any

operations running on the VMs fail or stop.

If you manually run the reboot_helper.py script to shut down a vSAN cluster, the process cleans unused cron jobs registered during the shutdown. However, the

script might start a new cron instance instead of restarting the cron daemon after cleaning the unused cron jobs. As a result, multiple cron instances might

accumulate and you see cron jobs executed multiple times.

If you run a recursive call on a large datastore, such as DatastoreBrowser::SearchSubFolders, a memory leak condition might cause the hostd service to fail with

an out-of-memory error.

When you enable encryption for a vSAN cluster with a Key Management Interoperability Protocol (KMIP) provider, the following health check might report

status errors: vCenter KMS status.

For all-flash vSAN configurations, you might see larger than required recommended size for the core dump partition. As a result, the core dump configuration

check might fail.

In rare cases, hardware issues might cause an SQlite DB corruption that makes multiple VMs become inaccessible and lead to some downtime for applications.

When a vSAN host has memory pressure, adding disks to a disk group might cause failure of the memory block attributes (blkAttr) component initialization.

Without the blkAttr component, commit and flush tasks stop, which causes log entries to build up in the SSD and eventually cause а congestion. As a result, a

NMI failure might occur due to the CPU load for processing the large number of log entries.

In some cases, the host designated as the leader cannot send heartbeat messages to other hosts in a large vSAN cluster. This issue occurs when the leader

uses an insufficient size of the TX buffer. The result is that new hosts cannot join the cluster with large cluster support (up to 64 hosts) enabled.

On a vSAN cluster with a large number of idle virtual machines, vSAN hosts might experience memory congestion due to higher scrub frequency.

An issue with trim space operations count might cause a large number of pending delete operations in vSAN. If an automatic rebalancing operation triggers, it

cannot progress due to such pending delete operations. For example, if you set the rebalancing threshold at 30%, you do not see any  progress on

rebalancing even when the storage capacity reaches 80%.

Due to a dependency between the management of virtual RAM and virtual NVDIMM within a virtual machine, excessive access to the virtual NVDIMM device

might lead to a lock spinout while accessing virtual RAM and cause the ESXi host to fail with a purple diagnostic screen. In the backtrace, you see the

following:

SP_WaitLock

SPLockWork

AsyncRemapPrepareRemapListVM

AsyncRemap_AddOrRemapVM

LPageSelectLPageToDefrag

VmAssistantProcessTasks

When you enable Latency Sensitivity on virtual machines, some threads of the Likewise Service Manager (lwsmd), which sets CPU affinity explicitly, might

compete for CPU resources on such virtual machines. As a result, you might see the ESXi host and the hostd service to become unresponsive.

ESXi670-202111001 adds two fixes to the USB host controller for cases when a USB or SD device lose connectivity to the /bootbank partition:

1. Adds a parameter usbStorageRegisterDelaySecs.

The usbStorageRegisterDelaySecs parameter is part of the vmkusb module and it delays to register cached USB storage device within the limit of 0 to 600

seconds. The default delay is 10 seconds. The parametric delay makes sure that if the USB host controller disconnects from your vSphere system and

any resource on the device, such as dump files, is still in use by ESXi, the USB or SD device does not get a new path that might break connection to

the /bootbank partition or corrupt the VMFS-L LOCKER partition.

2. Enhances the USB host controller driver to tolerate command timeout failures.

In cases when a device, such as Dell IDSDM, reconnects by a hardware signal, or a USB device resets due to a heavy workload, the USB host controller

driver might make only one retry to restore connectivity. With the fix, the controller makes multiple retries and extends tolerance to timeout failures.

Some LDAP queries that have no specified timeouts might cause a significant delay in domain join operations for adding an ESXi host to an Active Directory

domain.

After an upgrade of the brcmfcoe driver on Hitachi storage arrays, ESXi hosts might fail to boot and lose connectivity.

The OEM smartpqi driver in ESXi 670-202111001 uses a new logical LUN ID assignment rule to become compatible with the drivers of versions later than

1.0.3.2323. As a result, OEM smartpqi drivers of version 1.0.3.2323 and earlier might fail to blink LEDs or get the physical locations on logical drives.

When vSphere Replication is enabled on a virtual machine, you might see higher datastore and in-guest latencies that in certain cases might lead to ESXi hosts

becoming unresponsive to vCenter Server. The increased latency comes from vSphere Replication computing MD5 checksums on the I/O completion path,

which delays all other I/Os.

Known Issues

The known issues are grouped as follows.

Miscellaneous Issues

Known Issues from Prior Releases

Miscellaneous Issues

The sensord daemon fails to report ESXi host hardware status

A logic error in the IPMI SDR validation might cause sensord to fail to identify a source for power supply information. As a result, when you run the command

vsish -e get /power/hostStats, you might not see any output.

Workaround: None

The ESXi SNMP service intermittently stops working and ESXi hosts become unresponsive

If your environment has IPv6 disabled, the ESXi SNMP agent might stop responding. As a result, ESXi hosts also become unresponsive. In the VMkernel logs, you

see multiple messages such as Admission failure in path: snmpd/snmpd.3955682/uw.3955682.

Workaround: Manually restart the SNMP service or use a cron job to periodically restart the service.

Stateful ESXi installation might fail on hosts with a hardware iSCSI disk connected to a Emulex OneConnect OCe11100 or 14000 NIC device

An issue with the IMA elx-esx-libelxima plug-in might cause the hostd service to fail and statefull ESXi installation cannot complete on hosts with hardware iSCSI

disk connected to a Emulex OneConnect OCe11100 or 14000 NIC device. After a network boot, the ESXi server does not reboot, but you see no errors in the

vSphere Client or vSphere Web Client.

Workaround: Install a vendor-provided async version of the elx-esx-libelxima plug-in.

The Windows guest OS of a virtual machine configured with a virtual NVDIMM of size less than 16MB might fail while initializing a new disk

If you configure a Windows virtual machine with a NVDIMM of size less than 16MB, when you try to initialize a new disk, you might see either the guest OS failing

with a blue diagnostic screen or an error message in a pop-up window in the Disk Management screen. The blue diagnostic screen issue occurs in Windows 10,

Windows Server 2022, and Windows 11 v21H2 guest operating systems.

Workaround: Increase the size of the virtual NVDIMM to 16MB or larger.

Known Issues from Previous Releases

IMPORTANT: VMware removed ESXi 7.0 Update 3, 7.0 Update 3a and 7.0 Update 3b from all sites on November 19, 2021 due to an upgrade-impacting issue. Build

19193900 for ESXi 7.0 Update 3c ISO replaces build 18644231, 18825058, and 18905247 for ESXi 7.0 Update 3, 7.0 Update 3a, and 7.0 Update 3b respectively. To make

sure you run a smooth upgrade to vSphere 7.0 Update 3c, see VMware knowledge base articles 86447 and 87327.

What's New

If your source system contains the ESXi 7.0 Update 2 release (build number 17630552) or later builds with Intel drivers, before upgrading to ESXi 7.0 Update 3c,

see the Resolved Issues and Known Issues sections, and the VMware vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3c Release Notes.

ESXi 7.0 Update 3c delivers bug and security fixes documented in the Resolved Issues section, and VMware knowledge base articles 86255, 86158,

85982, 86283, and 86100.

For new features in the rolled back releases, see this list:

vSphere Memory Monitoring and Remediation, and support for snapshots of PMem VMs: vSphere Memory Monitoring and Remediation collects data and

provides visibility of performance statistics to help you determine if your application workload is regressed due to Memory Mode. vSphere 7.0 Update 3 also

adds support for snapshots of PMem VMs. For more information, see vSphere Memory Monitoring and Remediation.

Extended support for disk drives types: Starting with vSphere 7.0 Update 3, vSphere Lifecycle Manager validates the following types of disk drives and storage

device configurations:

• HDD (SAS/SATA)

• SSD (SAS/SATA)

• SAS/SATA disk drives behind single-disk RAID-0 logical volumes

For more information, see Cluster-Level Hardware Compatibility Checks.

Use vSphere Lifecycle Manager images to manage a vSAN stretched cluster and its witness host: Starting with vSphere 7.0 Update 3, you can use vSphere

Lifecycle Manager images to manage a vSAN stretched cluster and its witness host. For more information, see Using vSphere Lifecycle Manager Images to

Remediate vSAN Stretched Clusters.

vSphere Cluster Services (vCLS) enhancements: With vSphere 7.0 Update 3, vSphere admins can configure vCLS virtual machines to run on specific datastores

by configuring the vCLS VM datastore preference per cluster. Admins can also define compute policies to specify how the vSphere Distributed Resource

Scheduler (DRS) should place vCLS agent virtual machines (vCLS VMs) and other groups of workload VMs.

Improved interoperability between vCenter Server and ESXi versions: Starting with vSphere 7.0 Update 3, vCenter Server can manage ESXi hosts from the

previous two major releases and any ESXi host from version 7.0 and 7.0 updates. For example, vCenter Server 7.0 Update 3 can manage ESXi hosts of versions

6.5, 6.7 and 7.0, all 7.0 update releases, including later than Update 3, and a mixture of hosts between major and update versions.

New VMNIC tag for NVMe-over-RDMA storage traffic: ESXi 7.0 Update 3 adds a new VMNIC tag for NVMe-over-RDMA storage traffic. This VMkernel port

setting enables NVMe-over-RDMA traffic to be routed over the tagged interface. You can also use the ESXCLI command esxcli network ip interface tag add -i

<interface name> -t NVMeRDMA to enable the NVMeRDMA VMNIC tag.

NVMe over TCP support: vSphere 7.0 Update 3 extends the NVMe-oF suite with the NVMe over TCP storage protocol to enable high performance and

parallelism of NVMe devices over a wide deployment of TCP/IP networks.

Zero downtime, zero data loss for mission critical VMs in case of Machine Check Exception (MCE) hardware failure: With vSphere 7.0 Update 3, mission critical

VMs protected by VMware vSphere Fault Tolerance can achieve zero downtime, zero data loss in case of Machine Check Exception (MCE) hardware failure,

because VMs fallback to the secondary VM, instead of failing. For more information, see How Fault Tolerance Works.

Micro-second level time accuracy for workloads: ESXi 7.0 Update 3 adds the hardware timestamp Precision Time Protocol (PTP) to enable micro-second level

time accuracy. For more information, see Use PTP for Time and Date Synchronization of a Host.

Improved ESXi host timekeeping configuration:  ESXi 7.0 Update 3 enhances the workflow and user experience for setting an ESXi host timekeeping

configuration. For more information, see Editing the Time Configuration Settings of a Host.

For a table of build numbers and versions of VMware ESXi, see VMware knowledge base article 2143832.

IMPORTANT:

Starting with vSphere 7.0, VMware uses components for packaging VIBs along with bulletins. The ESXi and esx-update bulletins depend on each other. Always

include both in a single ESXi host patch baseline or include the rollup bulletin in the baseline to avoid failure during host patching.

When patching ESXi hosts by using VMware Update Manager from a version prior to ESXi 7.0 Update 2, it is strongly recommended to use the rollup bulletin in

the patch baseline. If you cannot use the rollup bulletin, be sure to include all of the following packages in the patching baseline. If the following packages are not

included in the baseline, the update operation fails:

VMware-vmkusb_0.1-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher

VMware-vmkata_0.1-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher

VMware-vmkfcoe_1.0.0.2-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher

VMware-NVMeoF-RDMA_1.0.1.2-1vmw.701.0.0.16850804 or higher

Rollup Bulletin

This rollup bulletin contains the latest VIBs with all the fixes after the initial release of ESXi 7.0.

Patch Download and Installation

In vSphere 7.x, the Update Manager plug-in, used for administering vSphere Update Manager, is replaced with the Lifecycle Manager plug-in. Administrative operations

for vSphere Update Manager are still available under the Lifecycle Manager plug-in, along with new capabilities for vSphere Lifecycle Manager.

The typical way to apply patches to ESXi 7.x hosts is by using the vSphere Lifecycle Manager. For details, see About vSphere Lifecycle Manager and vSphere Lifecycle

Manager Baselines and Images.

You can also update ESXi hosts without using the Lifecycle Manager plug-in, and use an image profile instead. To do this, you must manually download the patch

offline bundle ZIP file after you log in to VMware Customer Connect. From the Select a Product drop-down menu, select ESXi (Embedded and Installable) and from

the Select a Version drop-down menu, select 7.0. For more information, see the Upgrading Hosts by Using ESXCLI Commands and the VMware ESXi Upgrade guide.

Product Support Notices

Deprecation of localos accounts: Support for use of localos accounts as an identity source is deprecated. VMware plans to discontinue support for use of the

local operating system as an identity source. This functionality will be removed in a future release of vSphere.

The cURL version in ESXi650-202110001 and ESXi670-202111001 is later than the cURL version in ESXi 7.0 Update 3c: The cURL version in ESXi 7.0 Update

3c is 7.77.0, while ESXi650-202110001 and ESXi670-202111001 have the newer fixed version 7.78.0. As a result, if you upgrade from ESXi650-202110001 or

ESXi670-202111001 to ESXi 7.0 Update 3c, cURL 7.7.0 might expose your system to the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2021-22926: CVSS 7.5

CVE-2021-22925: CVSS 5.3

CVE-2021-22924: CVSS 3.7

CVE-2021-22923: CVSS 5.3

CVE-2021-22922: CVSS 6.5

cURL version 7.78.0 comes with a future ESXi 7.x release.

Merging the lpfc and brcmnvmefc drivers: Starting with vSphere 7.0 Update 3c, the brcmnvmefc driver is no longer available. The NVMe over Fibre Channel

functionality previously delivered with the brcmnvmefc driver is now included in the lpfc driver.

Deprecation of RDMA over Converged Ethernet (RoCE) v1: VMware intends in a future major vSphere release to discontinue support for the network protocol

RoCE v1. You must migrate drivers that rely on the RoCEv1 protocol to RoCEv2. In addition, you must migrate paravirtualized remote direct memory access

(PVRDMA) network adapters for virtual machines and guest operating systems to an adapter that supports RoCEv2.

Deprecation of SD and USB devices for the ESX-OSData partition: The use of SD and USB devices for storing the ESX-OSData partition, which consolidates the

legacy scratch partition, locker partition for VMware Tools, and core dump destinations, is being deprecated. SD and USB devices are supported for boot bank

partitions. For warnings related to the use of SD and USB devices during ESXi 7.0 Update 3c update or installation, see VMware Knowledge Based Article 85615.

For more information, see VMware knowledge base article 85685.

Due to a rare issue with handling Asynchronous Input/Output (AIO) calls, hostd and vpxa services on an ESXi host might fail and trigger alarms in the vSphere

Client. In the backtrace, you see errors such as:

#0 0x0000000bd09dcbe5 in __GI_raise (sig=6) at ../nptl/sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/raise.c:56

#1 0x0000000bd09de05b in __GI_abort () at abort.c:90

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure the AioSession object works as expected.

A very rare issue with NVIDIA vGPU-powered virtual machines might cause ESXi hosts to fail with a purple diagnostic screen

In very rare conditions, ESXi hosts with NVIDIA vGPU-powered virtual machines might intermittently fail with a purple diagnostic screen with a kernel panic error.

The issue might affect multiple ESXi hosts, but not at the same time. In the backlog, you see kernel reports about heartbeat timeouts against CPU for x seconds

and the stack informs about a P2M cache.

This issue is resolved in this release.

ESXi hosts with virtual machines with Latency Sensitivity enabled might randomly become unresponsive due to CPU starvation

When you enable Latency Sensitivity on virtual machines, some threads of the Likewise Service Manager (lwsmd), which sets CPU affinity explicitly, might

compete for CPU resources on such virtual machines. As a result, you might see the ESXi host and the hostd service to become unresponsive.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure lwsmd does not set CPU affinity explicitly.

In very rare cases, the virtual NVME adapter (VNVME) retry logic in ESXi 7.0 Update 3 might potentially cause silent data corruption

The VNVME retry logic in ESXi 7.0 Update 3 has an issue that might potentially cause silent data corruption. Retries rarely occur and they can potentially, not

always, cause data errors. The issue affects only ESXi 7.0 Update 3.

This issue is resolved in this release.

ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen during shutdown due to stale metadata

In rare cases, when you delete a large component in an ESXi host, followed by a reboot, the reboot might start before all metadata of the component gets

deleted. The stale metadata might cause the ESXi host to fail with a purple diagnostic screen.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure no pending metadata remains before a reboot of ESXi hosts.

Virtual desktop infrastructure (VDI) might become unresponsive due to a race condition in the VMKAPI driver

Event delivery to applications might delay indefinitely due to a race condition in the VMKAPI driver. As a result, the virtual desktop infrastructure in some

environments, such as systems using NVIDIA graphic cards, might become unresponsive or lose connection to the VDI client.

This issue is resolve in this release.

ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen due to issues with ACPI Component Architecture (ACPICA) semaphores

Several issues in the implementation of ACPICA semaphores in ESXi 7.0 Update 3 and earlier can result in VMKernel panics, typically during boot. An issue in the

semaphore implementation can cause starvation, and on several call paths the VMKernel might improperly try to acquire an ACPICA semaphore or to sleep

within ACPICA while holding a spinlock. Whether these issues cause problems on a specific machine depends on details of the ACPI firmware of the machine.

These issues are resolved in this release. The fix involves a rewrite of the ACPICA semaphores in ESXi, and correction of the code paths that try to enter ACPICA

while holding a spinlock.

ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen when I/O operations run on a software iSCSI adapter

I/O operations on a software iSCSI adapter might cause a rare race condition inside the iscsi_vmk driver. As a result, ESXi hosts might intermittently fail with a

purple diagnostic screen.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Networking Issues

If you use a vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS) of version earlier than 6.6 and change the LAG hash algorithm, ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic

screen

If you use a VDS of version earlier than 6.6 on a vSphere 7.0 Update 1 or later system, and you change the LAG hash algorithm, for example from L3 to L2

hashes, ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen.

This issue is resolved in this release.

You see packet drops for virtual machines with VMware Network Extensibility (NetX) redirection enabled

In vCenter Server advanced performance charts, you see an increasing number of packet drop count for all virtual machines that have NetX redirection enabled.

However, if you disable NetX redirection, the count becomes 0.

This issue is resolved in this release.

An ESXi host might fail with a purple diagnostic screen during booting due to incorrect CQ to EQ mapping in an Emulex FC HBA

In rare cases, incorrect mapping of completion queues (CQ) when the total number of I/O channels of a Emulex FC HBA is not an exact multiple of the number of

event queues (EQ), might cause booting of an ESXi host to fail with a purple diagnostic screen. In the backtrace, you can see an error in the lpfc_cq_create()

method.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix ensures correct mapping of CQs to EQs.

ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen due to memory allocation issue in the UNIX domain sockets

During internal communication between UNIX domain sockets, a heap allocation might occur instead of cleaning ancillary data such as file descriptors. As a

result, in some cases, the ESXi host might report an out of memory condition and fail with a purple diagnostic screen with #PF Exception 14 and errors similar to

UserDuct_ReadAndRecvMsg().

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix cleans ancillary data to avoid buffer memory allocations.

NTP optional configurations do not persist on ESXi host reboot

When you set up optional configurations for NTP by using ESXCLI commands, the settings might not persist after the ESXi host reboots.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that optional configurations are restored into the local cache from ConfigStore during ESXi host bootup.

When you change the LACP hashing algorithm in systems with vSphere Distributed Switch of version 6.5.0, multiple ESXi hosts might fail with a purple

diagnostic screen

In systems with vSphere Distributed Switch of version 6.5.0 and ESXi hosts of version 7.0 or later, when you change the LACP hashing algorithm, this might

cause an unsupported LACP event error due to a temporary string array used to save the event type name. As a result, multiple ESXi hosts might fail with a

purple diagnostic screen.

This issue is resolved in this release. To avoid facing the issue, in vCenter Server systems of version 7.0 and later make sure you use a vSphere Distributed Switch

version later than 6.5.0.

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

Remediation of clusters that you manage with vSphere Lifecycle Manager baselines might take long

Remediation of clusters that you manage with vSphere Lifecycle Manager baselines might take long after updates from ESXi 7.0 Update 2d and earlier to a

version later than ESXi 7.0 Update 2d.

This issue is resolved in this release.

After updating to ESXi 7.0 Update 3, virtual machines with physical RDM disks fail to migrate or power-on on destination ESXi hosts

In certain cases, for example virtual machines with RDM devices running on servers with SNMP, a race condition between device open requests might lead to

failing vSphere vMotion operations.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix makes sure that device open requests are sequenced to avoid race conditions. For more information, see VMware

knowledge base article 86158.

After upgrading to ESXi 7.0 Update 2d and later, you see an NTP time sync error

In some environments, after upgrading to ESXi 7.0 Update 2d and later, in the vSphere Client you might see the error Host has lost time synchronization.

However, the alarm might not indicate an actual issue.

This issue is resolved in this release. The fix replaces the error message with a log function for backtracing but prevents false alarms.

Security Issues

Update to OpenSSL

The OpenSSL package is updated to version openssl-1.0.2zb.

Update to the Python package

The Python package is updated to address CVE-2021-29921.

You can connect to port 9080 by using restricted DES/3DES ciphers

With the OPENSSL command openssl s_client -cipher <CIPHER> -connect localhost:9080 you can connect to port 9080 by using restricted DES/3DES ciphers.

This issue is resolved in this release. You cannot connect to port 9080 by using the following ciphers: DES-CBC3-SHA, EDH-RSA-DES-CBC3-SHA, ECDHE-RSA-

DES-CBC3-SHA, and AECDH-DES-CBC3-SHA.

vSphere Client Issues

Virtual machines appear as inaccessible in the vSphere Client and you might see some downtime for applications

In rare cases, hardware issues might cause an SQlite DB corruption that makes multiple VMs become inaccessible and lead to some downtime for applications.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Storage Issues

Virtual machine operations fail with an error for insufficient disk space on datastore

A new datastore normally has a high number of large file block (LFB) resources and a lesser number of small file block (SFB) resources. For workflows that

consume SFBs, such as virtual machine operations, LFBs convert to SFBs. However, due to a delay in updating the conversion status, newly converted SFBs

might not be recognized as available for allocation. As a result, you see an error such as Insufficient disk space on datastore when you try to power on, clone, or

migrate a virtual machine.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSphere Virtual Volume snapshot operations might fail on the source volume or the snapshot volume on Pure storage

Due to an issue that allows the duplication of the unique ID of vSphere Virtual Volumes, virtual machine snapshot operations might fail, or the source volume

might get deleted. The issue is specific to Pure storage and affects Purity release lines 5.3.13 and earlier, 6.0.5 and earlier, and 6.1.1 and earlier.

This issue is resolved in this release.

vSAN Issues

You might see vSAN health errors for cluster partition when data-in-transit encryption is enabled

In the vSphere Client, you might see vSAN health errors such as vSAN cluster partition or vSAN object health when data-in-transit encryption is enabled. The issue

occurs because when a rekey operation starts in a vSAN cluster, a temporary resource issue might cause key exchange between peers to fail.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

A race condition between live migration operations might cause the ESXi host to fail with a purple diagnostic screen

In environments with VMs of 575 GB or more reserved memory that do not use Encrypted vSphere vMotion, a live migration operation might race with another

live migration and cause the ESXi host to fail with a purple diagnostic screen.

This issue is resolved in this release. However, in very rare cases, the migration operation might still fail, regardless that the root cause for the purple diagnostic

screen condition is fixed. In such cases, retry the migration when no other live migration is in progress on the source host, or enable Encrypted vSphere vMotion

on the virtual machines.

Resolved Issues from Previous Releases

Networking Issues

RDMA traffic by using the iWARP protocol might not complete

RDMA traffic by using the iWARP protocol on Intel x722 cards might time out and not complete.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Installation, Upgrade and Migration Issues

The /locker partition might be corrupted when the partition is stored on a USB or SD device

Due to the I/O sensitivity of USB and SD devices, the VMFS-L locker partition on such devices that stores VMware Tools and core dump files might get

corrupted.

This issue is resolved in this release. By default, ESXi loads the locker packages to the RAM disk during boot.

ESXi hosts might lose connectivity after brcmfcoe driver upgrade on Hitachi storage arrays

After an upgrade of the brcmfcoe driver on Hitachi storage arrays, ESXi hosts might fail to boot and lose connectivity.

This issue is resolved in this release.

After upgrading to ESXi 7.0 Update 2, you see excessive storage read I/O load

ESXi 7.0 Update 2 introduced a system statistics provider interface that requires reading the datastore stats for every ESXi host on every 5 min. If a datastore is

shared by multiple ESXi hosts, such frequent reads might cause a read latency on the storage array and lead to excessive storage read I/O load.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Virtual Machine Management Issues

Virtual machines with enabled AMD Secure Encrypted Virtualization-Encrypted State (SEV-ES) cannot create Virtual Machine Communication Interface (VMCI)

sockets

Performance and functionality of features that require VMCI might be affected on virtual machines with enabled AMD SEV-ES, because such virtual machines

cannot create VMCI sockets.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Virtual machines might fail when rebooting a heavily loaded guest OS

In rare cases, when a guest OS reboot is initiated outside the guest, for example from the vSphere Client, virtual machines might fail, generating a VMX dump.

The issue might occur when the guest OS is heavily loaded. As a result, responses from the guest to VMX requests are delayed prior to the reboot. In such cases,

the vmware.log file of the virtual machines includes messages such as: I125: Tools: Unable to send state change 3: TCLO error. E105: PANIC: NOT_REACHED

bora/vmx/tools/toolsRunningStatus.c:953.

This issue is resolved in this release.

Miscellaneous Issues

Asynchronous read I/O containing a SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT array of more than 16 members with at least 1 member falling in the last partial block of a

file might lead to ESXi host panic

In rare cases, in an asynchronous read I/O containing a SCATTER_GATHER_ELEMENT array of more than 16 members, at least 1 member might fall in the last partial block

of a file. This might lead to corrupting VMFS memory heap, which in turn causes ESXi hosts to fail with a purple diagnostic screen.

This issue is resolved in this release.

If a guest OS issues UNMAP requests with large size on thin provisioned VMDKs, ESXi hosts might fail with a purple diagnostic screen

ESXi 7.0 Update 3 introduced an uniform UNMAP granularity for VMFS and SEsparse snapshots, and set the maximum UNMAP granularity reported by VMFS to

2GB. However, in certain environments, when the guest OS makes a trim or unmap request of 2GB, such a request might require the VMFS metadata transaction

to do lock acquisition of more than 50 resource clusters. VMFS might not handle such requests correctly. As a result, an ESXi host might fail with a purple

diagnostic screen. VMFS metadata transaction requiring lock actions on greater then 50 resource clusters is rare and can only happen on aged datastores. The

issue impacts only thin-provisioned VMDKs. Thick and eager zero thick VMDKs are not impacted.

Along with the purple diagnostic screen, in the /var/run/log/vmkernel file you see errors such as:

2021-10-20T03:11:41.679Z cpu0:2352732)@BlueScreen: NMI IPI: Panic requested by another PCPU. RIPOFF(base):RBP:CS [0x1404f8(0x420004800000):0x12b8:0xf48] (Src

This issue is resolved in this release.

The hostd service might fail due to a time service event monitoring issue

An issue in the time service event monitoring service, which is enabled by default, might cause the hostd service to fail. In the vobd.log file, you see errors such

as:

2021-10-21T18:04:28.251Z: [UserWorldCorrelator] 304957116us: [esx.problem.hostd.core.dumped] /bin/hostd crashed (1 time(s) so far) and a core file may have been

created at /var/core/hostd-zdump.000. This may have caused connections to the host to be dropped.

2021-10-21T18:04:28.251Z: An event (esx.problem.hostd.core.dumped) could not be sent immediately to hostd; queueing for retry. 2021-10-21T18:04:32.298Z:

Known Issues from Earlier Releases

Networking Issues

Stale NSX for vSphere properties in vSphere Distributed Switch 7.0 (VDS) or ESXi 7.x hosts might fail host updates

If you had NSX for vSphere with VXLAN enabled on a vSphere Distributed Switch (VDS) of version 7.0 and migrated to NSX-T Data Center by using NSX V2T

migration, stale NSX for vSphere properties in the VDS or some hosts might prevent ESXi 7.x hosts updates. Host update fails with a platform configuration error.

Workaround: Upload the CleanNSXV.py script to the /tmp dir in vCenter Server. Log in to the appliance shell as a user with super administrative privileges (for

example, root) and follow these steps:

1. Run CleanNSXV.py by using the command PYTHONPATH=$VMWARE_PYTHON_PATH python /tmp/CleanNSXV.py --user <vc_admin_user> --password <passwd>. The

<vc_admin_user> parameter is a vCenter Server user with super administrative privileges and <passwd> parameter is the user password.

For example:

PYTHONPATH=$VMWARE_PYTHON_PATH python /tmp/CleanNSXV.py --user 'administrator@vsphere.local' --password 'Admin123'

2. Verify if the following NSX for vSphere properties, com.vmware.netoverlay.layer0 and com.vmware.net.vxlan.udpport, are removed from the ESXi hosts:

1. Connect to a random ESXi host by using an SSH client.

2. Run the command net-dvs -l | grep "com.vmware.netoverlay.layer0\|com.vmware.net.vxlan.udpport".

If you see no output, then the stale properties are removed.

To download the CleanNSXV.py script and for more details, see VMware knowledge base article 87423.

Security Issues

The cURL version in ESXi650-202110001 and ESXi670-202111001 is later than the cURL version in ESXi 7.0 Update 3c

The cURL version in ESXi 7.0 Update 3c is 7.77.0, while ESXi650-202110001 and ESXi670-202111001 have the newer fixed version 7.78.0. As a result, if you

upgrade from ESXi650-202110001 or ESXi670-202111001 to ESXi 7.0 Update 3c, cURL 7.7.0 might expose your system to the following vulnerabilities:

CVE-2021-22926: CVSS 7.5

CVE-2021-22925: CVSS 5.3

CVE-2021-22924: CVSS 3.7

CVE-2021-22923: CVSS 5.3

CVE-2021-22922: CVSS 6.5

Workaround: None. cURL version 7.78.0 comes with a future ESXi 7.x release.

#### Issue/Introduction

VMware has investigated CVE-2021-22040 and CVE-2021-22041 and has determined that the possibility of exploitation can be removed by performing the steps detailed in the Workaround section of this article.

**This workaround is meant to be a temporary solution until updates documented in VMSA-2022-0004 can be deployed.**

#### Environment

VMware Workstation Pro 16.x (Windows)
VMware vSphere ESXi 6.7
VMware vSphere ESXi 6.5
VMware vSphere ESXi 7.0.0
VMware Workstation Pro 16.x (Linux)
VMware Fusion 12.x

#### Resolution

Resolution is documented in [VMSA-2022-0004.](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0004.html)

For details on the VMware ESXi fixes available, please see [KB87613](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/87613)

Workaround:

The workaround for both CVE-2021-22040 and CVE-2021-22041 is to remove **all USB controllers** from the Virtual Machine. As a result, USB pass through functionality will be unavailable.

In addition, virtual/emulated USB devices, such as VMware virtual USB stick or dongle will not be available for use by the virtual machine while the default keyboard/mouse as input devices are not affected as they are per default not connected through USB protocol but have a driver that does software device emulation in the guest OS.

**IMPORTANT**:
Certain guest operating systems, including Mac OS do not support using a PS/2 mouse and keyboard. Without a USB controller. these guest operating systems will be left without a mouse and keyboard.

The procedure for removing the virtual USB controllers for the affected products is described here:
