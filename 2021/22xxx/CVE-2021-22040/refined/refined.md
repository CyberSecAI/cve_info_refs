Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-22040:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a use-after-free vulnerability in the XHCI USB controller within VMware ESXi, Workstation, and Fusion products. This means that after the memory is freed, the program attempts to access it, potentially leading to a crash or unintended behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Use-after-free vulnerability in the XHCI USB controller.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious actor with local administrative privileges within a virtual machine can exploit this issue to execute code within the virtual machine's VMX process running on the host. This could lead to complete control of the host or further exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local privilege escalation from within a virtual machine.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs local administrative privileges on a virtual machine.
- The attacker does not require user interaction.

**Additional details from the documents:**

- VMSA-2022-0004 bundles CVE-2021-22040 with CVE-2021-22041 (double-fetch vulnerability in UHCI USB controller), CVE-2021-22042 (unauthorized access vulnerability in settingsd), CVE-2021-22043 (TOCTOU vulnerability in settingsd), and CVE-2021-22050 (ESXi slow HTTP POST denial of service vulnerability).
- Workaround: Remove all USB controllers from the virtual machine, which will disable USB passthrough functionality and virtual USB devices. Certain operating systems (e.g., Mac OS) may become unusable due to lack of PS/2 support, relying only on USB for keyboard/mouse input.
- Patched versions are available for ESXi (6.5, 6.7, 7.0 U1, 7.0 U2, 7.0 U3), Workstation Pro/Player (16.2.1), Fusion (12.2.1) and Cloud Foundation (3.x, 4.x).
- The affected components are mainly esx-base, vsan, vsanhealth, esx-update, and vmkusb VIBs, but may vary depending on ESXi version.
- ESXi670-202201001 is recommended over ESXi670-202111101-SG, as it fixes more issues.
