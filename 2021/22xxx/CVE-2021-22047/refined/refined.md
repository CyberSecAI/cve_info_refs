- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of custom controllers in Spring Data REST when a base API path is configured, leading to resources being exposed under URIs without the base path, bypassing intended security configurations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - **Insecure resource exposure:** Custom controllers using type-level `@RequestMapping` annotations are accessible through URIs that lack the configured base path, potentially exposing them without the intended security controls.
  - **Configuration-dependent vulnerability:** This only affects applications where the base path is configured to a non-empty string and a custom controller with a type-level `@RequestMapping` is registered.
  - **Lack of consistent security:** The vulnerability arises from a discrepancy in how security is applied to resources exposed by Spring Data REST vs. resources exposed through custom controllers that are in the same URI space.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
  - **Security bypass:** Attackers can access custom controller resources without going through the security measures applied to the main Spring Data REST base path.
  - **Potential unauthorized access:** Depending on the custom controller's functionality, exploitation could lead to data modification, data access, or other unauthorized actions.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - **Network access:** Exploitation occurs via HTTP requests made to URIs without the base path prefix.
  - **URI manipulation:** Attackers craft requests that target the exposed endpoints.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - **Network access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the application.
  - **Knowledge of exposed endpoints:** The attacker must be aware of the application's custom controller mappings.
