- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper handling of user-provided data in the request URI path during view template resolution in Spring Cloud Netflix Hystrix Dashboard. Specifically, when a request is made to `/hystrix/monitor;[user-provided data]`, the part after `/hystrix/monitor` is treated as a SpringEL expression.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Spring Expression Language (SpEL) injection vulnerability in the Hystrix Dashboard component. The application uses both `spring-cloud-netflix-hystrix-dashboard` and `spring-boot-starter-thymeleaf`, leading to the misinterpretation of URI path parameters.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Arbitrary code execution on the server. By crafting malicious SpringEL expressions within the URI, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server where the application is running.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/hystrix/monitor` endpoint with a malicious SpringEL expression appended to the URI path.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint of the application. The attack can be carried out remotely with only network access to the vulnerable application. The CVSS score indicates low privileges are required but this is only applicable for exploitation via network access.
