- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization when processing XML data, leading to an XML External Entity Injection (XXE) vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XML External Entity Injection (XXE)
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to potentially read local files on the server, cause denial of service, or other impacts that may stem from processing of malicious XML. The impact severity varies depending on the CVSS score: Confidentiality:Low, Integrity:None, Availability:Low using CVSS v3 metrics, which translates to overall impact of "Low". The CVSS v2 metric provides slightly higher impact for Confidentiality and Availability.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending malicious XML input to the application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have low privileges within the application (i.e. authenticated user) in order to exploit the vulnerability, and needs network access to the vulnerable system.
