- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when processing commands sent to the C-Gate 2 Service. This allows for the upload of arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unrestricted file upload due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network attack via commands sent to the C-Gate 2 Service.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Although authentication is required, the existing authentication mechanism can be bypassed. The attacker must have network access to the C-Gate 2 service.
