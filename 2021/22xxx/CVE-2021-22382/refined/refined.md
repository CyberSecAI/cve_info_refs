- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper permission assignment in Huawei LTE USB Dongle products.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability allows an attacker to perform unauthenticated operations after inducing a user to install a specially crafted application on a MAC OS system where the vulnerable USB dongle is used. This indicates a lack of proper access controls or permission checks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform unauthenticated operations.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - The attacker needs local access to a MAC OS system.
    - The attacker must induce a user to install a specially crafted application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to a target MAC OS system.
    - Ability to craft a malicious application.
    - Ability to convince the target user to install the malicious application.
