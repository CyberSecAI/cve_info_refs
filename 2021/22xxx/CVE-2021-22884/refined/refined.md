{
  "CVE-2021-22884": {
    "description": "Affected Node.js versions are vulnerable to a DNS rebinding attack when the whitelist includes “localhost6”. When “localhost6” is not present in /etc/hosts, it is just an ordinary domain that is resolved via DNS, i.e., over network. If the attacker controls the victim's DNS server or can spoof its responses, the DNS rebinding protection can be bypassed by using the “localhost6” domain. As long as the attacker uses the “localhost6” domain, they can still apply the attack described in CVE-2018-7160.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the inclusion of “localhost6” in the whitelist for DNS rebinding protection, which, when not present in /etc/hosts, can be resolved via DNS. This allows an attacker to potentially control DNS resolution and bypass the protection.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "DNS rebinding vulnerability",
      "Improper input validation in the whitelist"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass DNS rebinding protection and potentially achieve remote code execution by exploiting the inspector functionality, which is similar to CVE-2018-7160.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "DNS rebinding attack via the 'localhost6' domain"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the victim's DNS server or be capable of spoofing its responses, and also requires that the Node.js process is running with the debug port enabled."
