Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-22922:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in how `curl` handles Metalink files. When a Metalink file specifies multiple URLs for downloading content, `curl` verifies the downloaded content against a hash provided in the Metalink file. However, if a downloaded file from one of the URLs has a hash mismatch, `curl` does not discard the file. Instead, it keeps the potentially malicious content, even though a hash mismatch indicates that it's corrupted/modified, and only mentions the hash mismatch in a text message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** `curl` does not properly validate the integrity of downloaded content when using Metalink. It fails to discard content with mismatched hashes, which could be malicious.
*   **Lack of Automatic Fallback:** Instead of automatically discarding a file with a hash mismatch and attempting download from other URLs in Metalink file, curl stops after receiving the first file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Delivery of malicious content:**  An attacker could potentially compromise one of the servers listed in the Metalink file, replace the legitimate content with malicious content and cause `curl` to download the altered, malicious file, while still displaying a hash mismatch message.
*   **User Misinterpretation:** The user might miss the hash mismatch message and believe that the file is correct.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   A Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) attack is not required, the attack can be done by compromising one of the servers hosting the file listed in the Metalink file.
*   The attack vector involves exploiting a flaw in how `curl` processes Metalink files when downloading content from multiple sources specified in the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to compromise at least one of the servers hosting content specified in the Metalink XML file.
*   The attacker needs to be able to replace the legitimate file with a malicious version on the compromised server.
*   The attacker's server must be among the mirrors/locations listed in the Metalink file that `curl` uses.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability exists only in the `curl` tool, not in the `libcurl` library.
*   The vulnerability exists from `curl` version 7.27.0 up to and including 7.77.0.
*   The `curl` project decided to remove Metalink support in version 7.78.0 instead of fixing the issue.
*   The issue is identified as CWE-354, which is "Improper Validation of Integrity Check Value."
*   The vulnerability is classified as having medium severity.
