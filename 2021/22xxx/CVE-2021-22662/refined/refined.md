Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22662

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is a **Use-After-Free (UAF)** issue in how the FATEK Automation FvDesigner application processes project files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Use After Free (CWE-416):** The application improperly handles memory allocation and deallocation when processing project files. This can lead to accessing memory after it has been freed, causing unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system. This means an attacker can gain full control of the system running the vulnerable software.
*   The exploit may also lead to read or modify information, or crash the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves crafting a malicious project file specifically designed to trigger the Use-After-Free vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the specially crafted project file to the FvDesigner application. This typically means that the victim needs to open the malicious project file using the vulnerable software.
*   The attack is described as having a "low skill level to exploit".
*   The vulnerability is not remotely exploitable
*   The attack requires user interaction, the user must open a malicious project file.

**Additional Details**

*   The affected software is **FATEK Automation FvDesigner version 1.5.76 and prior.**
*   The vulnerability was reported by Francis Provencher {PRL} and rgod, working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 with a vector string of (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   The advisory also lists other vulnerabilities in the same product, CVE-2021-22670 (Access of Uninitialized Pointer), CVE-2021-22666 (Stack-Based Buffer Overflow), CVE-2021-22683 (Out-of-Bounds Write) and CVE-2021-22638 (Out-of-Bounds Read).
