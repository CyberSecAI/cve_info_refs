- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists due to insufficient validation of input parameters when processing a specific message.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can cause the process and service to become abnormal.
- **Attack vectors**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specific message to the target device. The attacker needs to have access to the target device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send messages to the target device. The specific method of message sending is not detailed.
