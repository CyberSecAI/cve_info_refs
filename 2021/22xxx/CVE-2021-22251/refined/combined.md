# ESCALATED: Projects are allowed to add members with different domain email address despite restricting in group settings

**[HackerOne report #679567](https://hackerone.com/reports/679567)** by `ashish_r_padelkar` on 2019-08-22, assigned to `gitlab_cmaxim`:

### Summary

Hello,

In new feature `https://gitlab.com/help/user/group/index#allowed-domain-restriction-premium-only` , it is mentioned that `You can restrict access to groups and their underlying projects by allowing only users with email addresses in particular domains to be added to the group`

However, this restriction only works at group level and not projects underneath it.

### Steps to reproduce

1. Go to group settings at `/-/edit#js-permissions-settings` and put `gitlab.com` under `Restrict membership by email`.
2. Now try to add members at group membership with different email and it wont allow you to do.
3. Now as a maintainer ,go to projects underneath it and add the email with different domain and it will successfully adds the member.

### What is the current *bug* behavior?

Allows adding email of different domains at project level despite setting it to group level

### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The settings should be applied at all levels as per documentation.

### Output of checks

This bug happens on GitLab.com and probably on omnibus installations too

Regards,

Ashish

## Impact

Allows adding members with different domain email addresses at project level despite group level settings.
