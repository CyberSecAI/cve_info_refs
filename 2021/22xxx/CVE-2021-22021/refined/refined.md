- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper user input validation in VMware vRealize Log Insight.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject a malicious payload via the Log Insight UI which would be executed when a victim accesses the shared dashboard link. This could allow the attacker to potentially perform malicious actions within the context of the victim's browser session.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs by injecting a malicious payload through the Log Insight UI. The payload is then executed when a victim accesses the shared dashboard link.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have user privileges to inject the payload.

The advisory provides a good amount of information, including affected versions, CVSS score, resolution (fixed versions), and the attack vector.
