- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The InstallBuilder Windows installer uses the `reg.exe` system command to manipulate the Windows registry, but does not enforce the full path to the command. This leads to the system searching for `reg.exe` in the search path.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path Interception via Search Order Hijacking. The installer does not use the full path to `reg.exe`, allowing an attacker to plant a malicious `reg.exe` in the search path that will be executed instead of the intended system command.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain arbitrary code execution with the security scope of the installer/uninstaller by replacing the system `reg.exe` with a malicious one.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to place a malicious `reg.exe` in a directory that is included in the search path, and have the malicious `reg.exe` be found before the legitimate one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs previous access to the machine to plant the malicious `reg.exe` before the vulnerable installer is executed.
