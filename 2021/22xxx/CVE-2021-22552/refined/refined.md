{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The sysno (system call number) in MessageReader was interpreted directly from the Message header passed from the host. A malicious host could provide a crafted Message header with a modified sysno.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper input validation of the sysno in the Message header. This allows a malicious host to potentially bypass validation checks within the enclave.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A malicious host could overwrite enclave memory by providing a modified sysno, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution or other undefined behavior within the enclave.",
  "Attack vectors": "A malicious host providing a crafted Message header during a system call to the enclave.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to control the host environment and be able to send system calls to the enclave with crafted message headers."
