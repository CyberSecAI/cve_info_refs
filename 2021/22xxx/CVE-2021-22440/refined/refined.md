- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The software uses external input to construct a pathname without properly validating it. This allows an attacker to craft a filename to access locations outside of the restricted directory.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability due to improper validation of pathnames constructed from external input.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access locations outside the intended restricted directory. This could potentially lead to unauthorized access to sensitive files or system resources.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker connects a smartphone through a USB cable and uses a crafted filename.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device via USB connection and the ability to provide a crafted filename.
