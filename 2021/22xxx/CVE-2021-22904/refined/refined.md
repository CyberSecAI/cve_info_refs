Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-22904:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the Token Authentication logic in Action Controller of Ruby on Rails. Specifically, the issue arises from how `authenticate_or_request_with_http_token` or `authenticate_with_http_token` parses HTTP token headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- The core vulnerability is a Denial of Service (DoS). The way the token authentication parses the incoming HTTP token can be exploited to cause a denial of service. The specific weakness is within the regular expression used to parse the token, as the provided monkey patch defines: `AUTHN_PAIR_DELIMITERS = /(?:,|;|\t)/`
.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation leads to a Denial of Service (DoS), impacting availability of the application or service.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector involves sending specially crafted HTTP requests with manipulated token headers to an affected Rails application.
- An attacker doesn't need authentication to send the crafted HTTP request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable application. No specific position or authentication is required.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability affects Ruby on Rails versions 4.0.0 and greater.
- Fixed versions are 6.1.3.2, 6.0.3.7, 5.2.4.6 and 5.2.6.
- A workaround is provided through monkey patching.
- Patches are provided for the 5.2, 6.0, and 6.1 series.
- NetApp products are not affected by this CVE.
