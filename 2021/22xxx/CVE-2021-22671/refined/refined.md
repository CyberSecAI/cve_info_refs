Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22671:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow vulnerabilities occur while processing long domain names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-190: Integer Overflow or Wraparound:** The software fails to properly validate or handle the length of domain names, leading to an integer overflow. This overflow can corrupt memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device.
*   **Denial of Service:** While not explicitly stated, memory corruption due to the overflow can also cause the device to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specially crafted network traffic containing overly long domain names.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the affected device.
*   **No Special Privileges:** The attack can be carried out without requiring any prior authentication or special access to the target device.
