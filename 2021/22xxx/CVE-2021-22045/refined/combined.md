# Advisory Details

January 6th, 2022
## VMware Workstation SCSI Heap-based Buffer Overflow Privilege Escalation Vulnerability

### ZDI-22-003ZDI-CAN-14237

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-22045](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22045) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [VMware](https://www.vmware.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | Workstation |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows local attackers to escalate privileges on affected installations of VMware Workstation. An attacker must first obtain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target guest system in order to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the SCSI component. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a fixed-length heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of the hypervisor. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | VMware has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |

#### Issue/Introduction

VMware has investigated **CVE-2021-22045** and determined that the possibility of exploitation can be removed by performing the steps detailed in the **Workaround** section of this article.

**This workaround is meant to be a temporary solution until updates documented in** [**VMSA-2022-0001**](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0001.html) **can be deployed.**

| **ESXi Version** | **Fixed Version** | **Build Number** | **Release date** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 6.5 | [**6.5 P07**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/rn/esxi650-202110001.html) | [**18678235**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/rn/esxi650-202110001.html) | **[October 12th 2021](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.5/rn/esxi650-202110001.html)** |
| 6.7 | [**6.7 P06**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/esxi670-202111001.html) | [**18828794**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/esxi670-202111001.html) | **[November 23rd 2021](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/6.7/rn/esxi670-202111001.html)** |
| 7.0 | [**7.0 U3C**](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u3c-release-notes.html) | **[19193900](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u3c-release-notes.html)** | **[January 27th 2022](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/rn/vsphere-esxi-70u3c-release-notes.html)** |

VMware **strongly** recommended that customers update to the ESXi version(s) highlighted above.
There is no requirement to implement the workaround once the recommended upgrade is complete

#### Resolution

Resolution for CVE-2021-22045 is documented in [VMSA-2022-0001](https://www.vmware.com/security/advisories/VMSA-2022-0001.html) .

Workaround:

This workaround requires that all CD-ROM/DVD devices are disabled/disconnected on all running virtual machines

For more information please see "[Remove Unnecessary Hardware Devices"](https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-vSphere/7.0/com.vmware.vsphere.security.doc/GUID-600D24C8-0F77-4D96-B273-A30F256B29D4.html)

1) Log in to a vCenter Server system using the vSphere Web Client.
2) Right-click the virtual machine and click Edit Settings.
3) Select the CD/DVD drive and uncheck "Connected" and "Connect at power on" and remove any attached ISOs.
