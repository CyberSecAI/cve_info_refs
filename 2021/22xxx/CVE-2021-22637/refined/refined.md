Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-22637:

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability lies within the parsing of VPR project files by Fuji Electric Tellus Lite V-Simulator and V-Server Lite software. Specifically, a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data length before copying it to a fixed-length stack buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** The primary vulnerability is a stack-based buffer overflow due to insufficient length validation when processing project files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is local (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R). An attacker needs to craft a malicious VPR project file and trick the user into opening it. This can be done by having the target open a malicious file or visiting a malicious page that contains the file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to deliver the crafted malicious VPR project file to the targeted system, as direct network access is not required. The attacker needs to convince a user to open the file or the page hosting the file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Fuji Electric Tellus Lite V-Simulator and V-Server Lite versions prior to v4.0.10.0.
*   The advisory notes that the vendor has released a patch.
*   The vulnerability is rated with a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   Multiple other vulnerabilities with similar attack vectors and impacts were also identified (CVE-2021-22655, CVE-2021-22653, CVE-2021-22639, and CVE-2021-22641).
