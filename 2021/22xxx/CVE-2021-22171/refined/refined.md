{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from an insufficient validation of the domain parameter during the GitLab Pages authentication process. Specifically, the system checks if a domain is controlled by GitLab Pages by verifying if the domain matches or has a suffix matching the GitLab Pages domain, or if it is configured in any pages project. This validation is bypassable by adding the attacker's domain to any pages project, even without proper CNAME record setup.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient domain validation",
      "Bypassable regex for GitLab Pages authentication",
      "Lack of robust domain ownership verification"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can steal a user's authentication code for GitLab Pages, gaining unauthorized access to private GitLab Pages content. The attacker redirects the victim to an attacker-controlled domain to intercept the OAuth code, which can then be used to complete the authentication process for the victim's private GitLab Pages.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker crafts a malicious link to projects.gitlab.io with a domain parameter pointing to an attacker-controlled domain and sends it to the victim.",
         "The attacker adds the attacker-controlled domain to a GitLab Pages project in order to bypass the domain verification."
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL, trick a user into visiting this link, and have access to a domain to which the victim's browser will be redirected. Also, the attacker needs a GitLab account to add the attacker-controlled domain in any GitLab page project.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability involves a bypass in the GitLab Pages authentication regex. The attacker exploits this by tricking a user to visit a crafted URL which redirects to attacker domain and captures the authorization code and then uses it to access a victims private GitLab Pages."
