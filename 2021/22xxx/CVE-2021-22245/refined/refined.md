Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22245

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject a large payload into the `user.name` field within Git configuration, which is then processed by GitLab when displaying branch information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unsanitized Input:** GitLab does not properly sanitize or limit the length of the `user.name` field from Git commits.
*   **Resource Exhaustion:** Processing extremely long names leads to excessive resource consumption, causing a denial of service (DoS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to the following:
    *   Inaccessible branch page (`/-/branches`): The branch page becomes unresponsive, displaying a 503 error.
    *   Inaccessible project page: If the malicious commit is pushed to the master branch (or if developers have permission to push to master), the entire project page becomes unavailable (404 error).
    *   Potentially unavailable settings pages.
    *   Users cannot access project or branches via the web UI.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Git Command Injection:** An attacker uses `git config --global user.name` to inject an overly long string.
*   **Malicious Commit:** The attacker creates a commit with the injected name and pushes it to the repository.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Project Member:** The attacker must be a member of the GitLab project (with at least developer permissions) to push commits to the repository.
*   **Maintainer permissions:** If the attacker has maintainer permissions they can directly cause the DoS on the master branch, impacting all lower branches.
*   **Developer permissions:** If the attacker has developer permissions, they can cause a DoS on any branch that is not the master branch.
*   **Git Access:** The attacker needs access to the Git repository using Git CLI or equivalent.

**Additional details:**
*   The vulnerability affects GitLab.com.
*   The issue occurs because GitLab attempts to render the overly long username on the branches page.
*   The attacker can leverage the `git config --global user.name` command to inject a very long name.
*   The provided `name.txt` file contains the large payload for the `user.name` field.
*   The provided proof of concept demonstrates how to cause the denial of service with an injected name of 20,000 characters.
