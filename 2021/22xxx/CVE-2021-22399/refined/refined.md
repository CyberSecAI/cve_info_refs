- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Bluetooth function in some Huawei smartphones is vulnerable to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability stems from the Bluetooth module crashing due to specific broadcasts sent by third-party apps.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to an abnormal Bluetooth function, effectively causing a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves installing a malicious third-party application on a vulnerable Huawei smartphone.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to install a third-party app on the target device.
