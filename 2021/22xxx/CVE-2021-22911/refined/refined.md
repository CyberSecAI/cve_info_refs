Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22911:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a NoSQL injection vulnerability within the `getPasswordPolicy()` method in Rocket.Chat. The method takes a user-controlled `params.token` value, which is not properly validated, allowing it to be an object instead of a string. This allows an attacker to inject MongoDB operators into the query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Blind NoSQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a blind NoSQL injection through the `Users.findOne()` query. By using the `$regex` operator on the `services.password.reset.token` field, an attacker can create an oracle to leak the password reset token character by character.
2. **Lack of Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate user input, specifically the `params.token` parameter in the `getPasswordPolicy` function. It expects a string, but allows an object, which can contain malicious MongoDB operators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Password Reset Token Leakage:** An attacker can leak a user's password reset token by repeatedly making queries with different `$regex` values until they determine the entire token sequence.
2.  **Account Takeover:** By using the leaked reset token, an attacker can change a user's password and take over their account.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability in `getPasswordPolicy()` can be exploited without authentication.
2.  **Email Address Requirement:** An attacker needs to know the email address of a user who does not have two-factor authentication (2FA) enabled to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Knowledge of a User's Email Address:** The attacker needs the email address of a user who doesn't have 2FA enabled.
2.  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send requests to the vulnerable Rocket.Chat server.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content details the steps to escalate privileges and achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) using a chain of vulnerabilities. While the primary focus of CVE-2021-22911 is the initial NoSQL injection leading to password reset token leakage, the full attack chain is explained in the blog post. The blog post also details another NoSQL injection (Rocket.Chat Security Issue 0025) vulnerability via the `users.list` API endpoint that is used in the chain, but this is a separate vulnerability.
*   The blog post emphasizes the importance of proper input validation, using allowlists instead of blocklists, and restricting the use of operators in NoSQL queries.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in Rocket.Chat versions 3.13.2, 3.12.4, and 3.11.4.
