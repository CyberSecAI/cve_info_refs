{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-provided input when rendering epic pages. Specifically, the milestone title, which can contain user-controlled SVG code, is not sanitized when rendered within the due date tooltip on epic pages.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when they hover over the inherited due date in an epic's page. This can lead to actions within the application as the victim user and the theft of sensitive information, such as credentials and other user data.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "vector_description": "An attacker crafts a malicious SVG payload and injects this code into a milestone title. This milestone is then linked to an issue, which is then linked to an epic. When a user hovers over the inherited due date on the epic page, the unsanitized milestone title containing the malicious SVG is rendered, leading to XSS execution.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to create projects, issues, and milestones within a GitLab instance. They must also be able to assign these elements to create the exploit chain."
    },
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability can be triggered on GitLab.com using Firefox. Additionally, self-hosted GitLab instances without Content Security Policy (CSP) are also vulnerable on Safari, Chrome, and Firefox. The report shows that the injected JavaScript can be triggered by simply hovering over the due date in Firefox, by clicking the red circle in the due date tooltip in Chrome, and is also present in Safari without explicit action"
