Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22207:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw within the MS-WSP (Microsoft Wireless Protocol) dissector in Wireshark. This dissector, responsible for parsing network traffic using the MS-WSP protocol, contains a logic error that can cause excessive memory allocation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Excessive Memory Consumption:** The MS-WSP dissector, when processing malformed packets, can allocate a large amount of memory. The core vulnerability is the way the dissector handles certain data structures leading to uncontrolled memory allocation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can cause Wireshark to consume an excessive amount of memory. This can lead to a denial-of-service condition by exhausting system resources. This can occur when processing network captures containing crafted packets or by triggering it on live network traffic.
- **Resource Exhaustion:** Exploitation leads to memory exhaustion making wireshark become unresponsive or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Network Traffic:** An attacker can inject a malformed packet with malicious data into a network that is being captured by Wireshark.
- **Malicious Capture Files:** An attacker can create a specially crafted packet capture file and convince a user to open this file in Wireshark.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to inject network packets** into a network that's being monitored.
- **Ability to provide a malicious pcap file** to a victim user.
- An attacker can be located remotely if they can send network traffic or convince the victim to open a malicious capture file.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by crafted packets that use MS-WSP protocol.
-  The vulnerability is present in versions 3.4.0 to 3.4.4, and 3.2.0 to 3.2.12 of Wireshark.
-  The vulnerability is fixed in versions 3.4.5 and 3.2.13 of Wireshark.
