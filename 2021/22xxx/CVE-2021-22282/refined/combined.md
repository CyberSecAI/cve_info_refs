Vulnerability Details

Description

There is a file handling issue in the project extraction algorithm of B&R Automation Studio. The algorithm
may enable adversaries link forged files instead of B&R provided ones. Successful exploitation of these
vulnerability will enable the attacker to perform a code execution with the privileges of the application,
when opening a specially crafted B&R Automation Studio project.

Impact

An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to potentially execute code within the context of the affected
system, which might threaten the integrity and confidentiality of data or may cause a denial of service.

Workarounds and Mitigations

B&R recommends the following specific workarounds and mitigations:

Open only B&R Automation Studio project files from trusted source.
Protect locations where B&R Automation Studio projects are stored from unauthorized access. This
includes PLCs, when using the feature to back up project source files on target.
Do not run B&R Automation Studio in elevated mode.
Verify integrity of B&R Automation Studio project files, which are exchanged via potentially insecure
channels.
Make sure, that Windows User Access Control (UAC) is enabled.

In general, B&R recommends implementing the Cyber Security guidelines.
