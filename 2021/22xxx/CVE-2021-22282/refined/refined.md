- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper copy algorithm in the project extraction component of B&R Automation Studio allows linking of forged files instead of B&R provided ones.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: File handling issue in the project extraction algorithm that allows linking of forged files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the application, potentially compromising data integrity, confidentiality, and causing denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a specially crafted B&R Automation Studio project file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to create a malicious project file and convince the victim to open it. An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
