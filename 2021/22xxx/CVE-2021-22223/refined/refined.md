{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The descriptions of Feature flags were not sufficiently sanitized. While `Dompurify` was used to allow only `<strong>` tags, it did not sanitize the attributes of these tags, allowing attackers to introduce arbitrary DOM attributes.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insufficient input sanitization",
      "Improper DOM attribute handling"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges by tricking an administrator into performing actions via a crafted DOM attribute. In the provided scenario, the attacker could set a normal user as administrator.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker crafts a malicious description for a Feature Flag containing a `<strong>` tag with a `data-url` attribute that points to the API endpoint for setting a user as admin.",
        "The attacker then relies on the victim interacting with the crafted content within a vulnerable part of the application's UI (Audit Log)."
      ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
        "Ability to create or edit Feature Flags",
         "Knowledge of GitLab's API endpoints and how to construct a malicious URL."
       ],
     "attacker_position": "The attacker needs to be an authenticated user within a GitLab project to create or edit feature flags."
