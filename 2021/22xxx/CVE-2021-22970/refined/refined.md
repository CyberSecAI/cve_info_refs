Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-22970:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from Concrete CMS allowing the import of files from local IP addresses through the remote file uploading interface. This functionality creates an avenue for SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery):** The system did not properly restrict the source of imported files, allowing attackers to specify local IP addresses. This could enable attackers to make requests to internal services or resources on the private network.
*   **SSRF Mitigation Bypass (DNS Rebinding):** The vulnerability also allowed for a bypass of SSRF mitigations through DNS rebinding techniques, potentially enabling attacks against cloud infrastructure metadata services (like AWS IMDS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SSRF on Private LAN Servers:** Attackers could use the vulnerability to perform SSRF attacks against internal servers on the private network, potentially gaining access to sensitive data or services.
*   **SSRF Mitigation Bypass:** Attackers could potentially bypass standard SSRF mitigations using DNS rebinding, leading to further exploitation of internal or cloud resources.  For instance, accessing cloud IAAS (e.g., AWS) IAM keys.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote File Uploading Interface:** The attack vector involves using the remote file uploading interface of Concrete CMS to specify a URL using a local IP.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs a low privilege account to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to make network requests to the Concrete CMS server and, in the case of DNS rebinding, control DNS resolution.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **CVSS Score:** Concrete CMS security team assigned a CVSS v3.1 score of 3.5 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N).
*   **Mitigation:** The fix implemented in Concrete CMS disables importing files from local IP addresses using the remote file upload interface. The fix was included in versions 8.5.7 and 9.0.1.
*   **Reported By:** Adrian Tiron from FORTBRIDGE and Bipul Jaiswal reported the vulnerability.
