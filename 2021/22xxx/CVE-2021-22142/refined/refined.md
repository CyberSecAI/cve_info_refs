Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22142:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the use of an embedded, outdated version of the Chromium browser within Kibana's Reporting feature. This embedded browser is used to generate downloadable reports.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Unmaintained Third Party Components (CWE-1104):** Kibana uses a Chromium browser version that has known vulnerabilities. The embedded browser is not updated with the main Kibana releases, which makes it vulnerable when new vulnerabilities are found in Chromium.
*   **Vulnerable Chromium Browser:** The specific Chromium browser version embedded in Kibana contains known vulnerabilities, which can be exploited if a user with report generation permissions can render arbitrary HTML content.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **High Impact:** An attacker who can render arbitrary HTML can exploit known Chromium vulnerabilities to potentially achieve:
    *   **High Confidentiality Impact (C:H):** Access sensitive information.
    *   **High Integrity Impact (I:H):** Modify or corrupt data.
    *   **High Availability Impact (A:H):** Cause denial of service or disrupt system operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Arbitrary HTML Rendering:** An attacker must be able to render arbitrary HTML content using the embedded Chromium browser. This is achieved by a Kibana user with reporting permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Kibana User with Reporting Permissions:** The attacker must have the necessary permissions within Kibana to generate reports and thereby use the embedded Chromium browser.
*   **Ability to render arbitrary HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the content that is rendered by the vulnerable Chromium instance within Kibana's reporting feature.
*  **High effort (AC:H):** Exploiting this vulnerability requires high effort.

**Affected Versions:**

* All versions of Kibana after 7.0.0 and before 7.13.0 are vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Kibana version 7.13.0 or later, which includes a patched version of the embedded Chromium browser.

**CVSSv3 Score:** 6.6 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
