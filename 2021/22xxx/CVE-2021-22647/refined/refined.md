Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-22647:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of FBX and 3DS files within Siemens Solid Edge Viewer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Write:** The primary weakness is an out-of-bounds write, where the software writes data past the allocated memory region. This is caused by insufficient validation of input data within the FBX and 3DS file parsing functionality.
*   Memory corruption is mentioned in one of the advisories, indicating a general issue with how memory is handled during file parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process (Siemens Solid Edge Viewer). This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious File:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user opens a specially crafted FBX or 3DS file. This file can be delivered via:
    *   Visiting a malicious web page that initiates the download/opening of the file.
    *   Email attachments, or other file transfer methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction, as the victim needs to either visit a malicious page that initiates the download of a malicious file or manually open the malicious file.
*   **Low Skill Level:** According to the CISA advisory, exploiting this vulnerability requires a low skill level.
*   **Local access:**  The CISA advisory indicates that the vulnerability is not exploitable remotely and requires local access.

**Affected Products:**

*   Siemens Solid Edge Viewer

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is related to the parsing of FBX and 3DS files.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Siemens by rgod through the Zero Day Initiative.
*   Siemens has released an update to correct this vulnerability.
*   Multiple ZDI advisories (ZDI-21-322, ZDI-21-321, ZDI-21-318, ZDI-21-326, ZDI-21-320) are associated with CVE-2021-22647.
