Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-22871:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization/HTML escaping of user-provided input, specifically within the website URL property.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a persistent XSS issue. This occurs because the system stores unsanitized HTML code provided by a manager account in a website's URL property and then displays this unsanitized code on a specific page, the `affiliate-preview.php` tag generation screen.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker with manager-level privileges can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code into the website URL field. When other users access the `affiliate-preview.php` tag generation screen, this malicious code will execute in their browsers, potentially leading to:
    *   Data theft.
    *   Session hijacking.
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the victim's session.

*   **Limited Impact:** The advisory notes that the practical applications of this specific XSS vulnerability are not considered "particularly harmful". This is because the target users (who will view the injected code) will usually have the same level of access to the system as the attacker. Furthermore, the session cookie is not accessible via JavaScript, limiting the direct impact of the exploit.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Revive Adserver.
*   **Manager Account:** An attacker needs manager-level account credentials to inject malicious HTML into the affected field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Manager Access:** The attacker must possess valid manager account credentials within the Revive Adserver.
*   **Web Access:** The attacker needs access to the web-based management interface of the Revive Adserver to store the malicious payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by security researcher Keyur Vala.
*   The affected versions are <= 5.0.5.
*   The fix is included in version 5.1.0 and later.
*   The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation).
*   The CVSS v3.1 vector for this vulnerability is AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N.
*   The vulnerability is fixed by ensuring that the website URL property is HTML-escaped before being displayed on the `affiliate-preview.php` tag generation page.
