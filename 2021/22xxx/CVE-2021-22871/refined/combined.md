Revive Adserver Security Advisory                     REVIVE-SA-2021-001
------------------------------------------------------------------------
<https://www.revive-adserver.com/security/revive-sa-2021-001>
------------------------------------------------------------------------
CVE-IDs:               CVE-2021-22871, CVE-2021-22872, CVE-2021-22873
Date:                  2020-01-19
Risk Level:            Low
Applications affected: Revive Adserver
Versions affected:     <= 5.0.5
Versions not affected: >= 5.1.0
Website:               <https://www.revive-adserver.com/>
========================================================================

========================================================================
Vulnerability 1 - Persistent XSS
========================================================================
Vulnerability Type:    Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page
                       Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') [CWE-79]
CVE-ID:                CVE-2021-22871
CVSS Base Score:       3.5
CVSSv3.1 Vector:       AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
CVSS Impact Subscore:  2.5
CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 0.9
========================================================================

Description
-----------
A persistent XSS vulnerability has been discovered by security
researcher Keyur Vala. An attacker with manager account credential could
store HTML code in a website property, which could subsequently been
displayed unescaped on a specific page by other users in the system.

Details
-------
Any user with a manager account could store specifically crafted content
in the URL website property which was then displayed unsanitised in the
affiliate-preview.php tag generation screen, potentially by other users
in the system, allowing a persistent XSS attack to take place.
The target users would however mostly have access to the same resources
as the attacker, so the practical applications are not considered
particularly harmful, especially since the session cookie cannot be
accessed via JavaScript.

========================================================================
Vulnerability 2 - Reflected XSS
========================================================================
Vulnerability Type:    Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page
                       Generation ('Cross-site Scripting') [CWE-79]
CVE-ID:                CVE-2021-22872
CVSS Base Score:       4.3
CVSSv3.1 Vector:       AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
CVSS Impact Subscore:  1.4
CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 2.8
========================================================================

Description
-----------

Security researcher Axel Flamcourt has discovered that the fix for the
reflected XSS vulnerability in REVIVE-SA-2020-001 could be bypassed on
older browsers with specifically crafted payloads to the publicly
accessible afr.php delivery script of Revive Adserver. The practical
applications are not considered particularly harmful, especially since
the session cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript.

Details
-------
The previous fix was working on most modern browsers, but some older
browsers are not automatically url-encoding parameters and would leave
an opportunity to inject closing and opening script tags and achieve
reflected XSS attacks e.g. on IE11.

========================================================================
Vulnerability 3 - Open Redirect
========================================================================
Vulnerability Type:    URL Redirection to Untrusted Site
                       ('Open Redirect') [CWE-601]
CVE-ID:                CVE-2021-22873
CVSS Base Score:       5.4
CVSSv3.1 Vector:       AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
CVSS Impact Subscore:  2.5
CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 2.8
========================================================================

Description
-----------
An opportunity for open redirects has been available by design since the
early versions of Revive Adserver's predecessors in the impression and
click tracking scripts to allow third party ad servers to track such
metrics when delivering ads. Historically the display advertising
industry has considered that to be a feature, not a real vulnerability.
Things have evolved since then and third party click tracking via
redirects is not a viable option anymore, therefore any functionality
using open redirects in delivery scripts have been removed from Revive
Adserver.

Details
-------
The lg.php and ck.php delivery scripts were subject to open redirect via
either dest, oadest and/or ct0 parameters. All of them are now ignored
and redirects only performed (when applicable) to destination URLs
stored in the properties of the banner being displayed. A new signed
click delivery script has been introduced with an HMAC signed
destination parameter, allowing customisable destination URLs while
avoiding destinations from being tampered with by attackers.

# Revive Adserver Security Advisory REVIVE-SA-2021-001

* Advisory ID: REVIVE-SA-2021-001
* CVE-IDs:Â CVE-2021-22871,Â CVE-2021-22872,Â CVE-2021-22873
* Date: 2021-01-19
* Risk Level: Low
* Applications affected: Revive Adserver
* Versions affected: <= 5.0.5
* Versions not affected: >= 5.1.0
* Website: <https://www.revive-adserver.com/>

## Vulnerability 1 â Persistent XSS

* Vulnerability type:Â Improper Neutralization of Input During Web PageÂ Generation (âCross-site Scriptingâ)[CWE-79]
* CVE-ID:Â [CVE-2021-22871](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22871)
* CVSSv3.1 Vector:Â AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
* CVSS Base Score: 3.5
* CVSS Impact Subscore: 2.5
* CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 0.9

### Description

A persistent XSS vulnerability has been discovered by securityÂ researcher Keyur Vala. An attacker with manager account credential couldÂ store HTML code in a website property, which could subsequently beenÂ displayed unescaped on a specific page by other users in the system.

### Details

Any user with a manager account could store specifically crafted contentÂ in the URL website property which was then displayed unsanitised in theÂ affiliate-preview.php tag generation screen, potentially by other usersÂ in the system, allowing a persistent XSS attack to take place.Â The target users would however mostly have access to the same resourcesÂ as the attacker, so the practical applications are not consideredÂ particularly harmful, especially since the session cookie cannot beÂ accessed via JavaScript.

## Vulnerability 2 â Reflected XSS

* Vulnerability type:Â Improper Neutralization of Input During Web PageÂ Generation (âCross-site Scriptingâ)[CWE-79]
* CVE-ID:Â [CVE-2021-22872](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22872)
* CVSSv3.1 Vector: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N
* CVSS Base Score: 4.3
* CVSS Impact Subscore: 1.4
* CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 2.8

### Description

Security researcher Axel Flamcourt has discovered that the fix for theÂ reflected XSS vulnerability in REVIVE-SA-2020-001 could be bypassed onÂ older browsers with specifically crafted payloads to the publiclyÂ accessible afr.php delivery script of Revive Adserver. The practicalÂ applications are not considered particularly harmful, especially sinceÂ the session cookie cannot be accessed via JavaScript.

### Details

The previous fix was working on most modern browsers, but some olderÂ browsers are not automatically url-encoding parameters and would leaveÂ an opportunity to inject closing and opening script tags and achieveÂ reflected XSS attacks e.g. on IE11.

## Vulnerability 3 âÂ Open Redirect

* Vulnerability type:Â URL Redirection to Untrusted SiteÂ (âOpen Redirectâ) [CWE-601]
* CVE-ID:Â [CVE-2021-22873](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-22873)
* CVSSv3.1 Vector:Â AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N
* CVSS Base Score: 5.4
* CVSS Impact Subscore: 2.5
* CVSS Exploitability Subscore: 2.8

### Description

An opportunity for open redirects has been available by design since theÂ early versions of Revive Adserverâs predecessors in the impression andÂ click tracking scripts to allow third party ad servers to track suchÂ metrics when delivering ads. Historically the display advertisingÂ industry has considered that to be a feature, not a real vulnerability.Â Things have evolved since then and third party click tracking viaÂ redirects is not a viable option anymore, therefore any functionalityÂ using open redirects in delivery scripts have been removed from ReviveÂ Adserver.

### Details

The lg.php and ck.php delivery scripts were subject to open redirect viaÂ either dest, oadest and/or ct0 parameters. All of them are now ignoredÂ and redirects only performed (when applicable) to destination URLsÂ stored in the properties of the banner being displayed. A new signedÂ click delivery script has been introduced with an HMAC signedÂ destination parameter, allowing customisable destination URLs whileÂ avoiding destinations from being tampered with by attackers.
