# Privilege escalation of "external user" (with maintainer privilege) to internal access through project token

**[HackerOne report #1193062](https://hackerone.com/reports/1193062)** by `joaxcar` on 2021-05-12, assigned to [@rchan-gitlab](/rchan-gitlab "Ron Chan"):

[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

##### Summary

An "external user" (a user account with the status external) which is granted "Maintainer" role on any project on the GitLab instance where "project tokens" are allowed can elevate its privilege to "Internal". An external user with maintainer permissions could create a project token, which will be connected to a bot user with internal privileges on the GitLab instance. Thus, now being able to access all internal projects and snippets as a Guest user. This includes

* Accessing all information about internal projects as if having Guest permissions (including source code)
* Creating issues on internal projects
* Creating projects and groups (these will contain no members and thus be of little use)

An external user is by the documentation described as a way to let external contractors get access to limited parts of a GitLab instance [link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html#external-users). Stating that

```
This feature may be useful when for example a contractor is working on a given project and should only have access to that project.
```

There are no warnings about giving an external user maintainer permissions. It is also possible for ANY internal user to elevate the external user to maintainer on any internal project created by that user. Thus, there is no need to ask an Admin for permission to do this. Thus, an external user (if not already granted maintainer on a project) only needs to convince one other user on the system to create a project and invite the external user as maintainer.

##### Steps to reproduce

1. Create a user with "external user" activated
2. Use any internal user to invite the "external user" as maintainer to a project
3. Login as the "external user" and create a project token on the project, save the token
4. Use the token to probe internal projects

```
 curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects"
```

create groups

```
 curl -X POST --header "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/groups?name=newg&path=newgroup"
```

create issues on internal projects

```
curl -X POST --header "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects/21/issues?title=iWasHere"
```

access source code

```
curl --header "Authorization: Bearer <TOKEN>" "https://gitlab.domain.com/api/v4/projects/19/repository/blobs/83d9398518bdf1519b7b8fbbb3fa3e305a8554ef/raw"
```

##### Impact

An external user can access all internal projects. Thus leading to severe information disclosure and ability to interact by issues.

##### What is the current *bug* behavior?

An external user with maintainer privileges to a project can create a project token which is connected to a Bot with internal access.

##### What is the expected *correct* behavior?

The bot should not have internal access to the GitLab instance. It is stated that

```
Project access tokens are scoped to a project and can be used to authenticate with the GitLab API.
```

[link](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/project/settings/project_access_tokens.html)

Which makes it seam like the token does not have any permissions outside the project.

The bot should probably have "external privilege" as standard. At least an external user should not be able to use the bot to access internal projects.

## How To Reproduce

Please add [reproducibility information](https://about.gitlab.com/handbook/engineering/security/#reproducibility-on-security-issues) to this section:

## Proposal

Scope the permission of the project access token to be an external access token.

## All proposals considered

1. ~~Limit the creation of the project access token to limited set of users~~. [#331473 (comment 580396051)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331473#note_580396051 "Privilege escalation of \"external user\" (with maintainer privilege) to internal access  through project token") (Considered too complex)
2. Scope the permission of the project access token to be an external access token. [#331473 (comment 580396051)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331473#note_580396051 "Privilege escalation of \"external user\" (with maintainer privilege) to internal access  through project token")
3. ~~Prohibit external users from creating project tokens~~. [#331473 (comment 627885698)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331473#note_627885698 "Privilege escalation of \"external user\" (with maintainer privilege) to internal access  through project token") (Leaves vulnerable tokens which we can't arbitrarily disable/delete)
4. ~~Prohibit external users to be promoted to Maintainers~~. [#331473 (comment 627885698)](https://gitlab.com/gitlab-org/gitlab/-/issues/331473#note_627885698 "Privilege escalation of \"external user\" (with maintainer privilege) to internal access  through project token") (Leaves vulnerable tokens which we can't arbitrarily disable/delete)
