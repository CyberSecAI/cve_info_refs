Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the description field of scoped labels. Specifically, the application allows embedding SVG tags with potentially malicious content into the label description, which is then rendered without proper escaping when the label is displayed (e.g., in a tooltip).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via the label description and is then executed within the victim's browser when the label is displayed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- This allows attackers to perform actions as the victim user.
- They can also steal sensitive user data, including credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through crafting a malicious SVG payload within a label description.
- The malicious payload is triggered when a user views a page with a label using the crafted description (e.g. on a wiki page or in an issue).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create or modify labels in a project.
- The attacker has to craft a specific SVG payload to trigger the XSS vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**
- The attacker embeds a `<svg>` tag in the label description.
- The SVG tag contains potentially malicious code:
  - An `<iframe>` element with a `srcdoc` attribute embedding a script (`<script>`) that executes Javascript. This can be triggered on Firefox.
  -  An `<image>` tag with an `onerror` attribute containing Javascript code, which is triggered on Safari.
  -  An `<a>` tag with a `xlink:href` containing Javascript code. This is triggered on Chrome for Android.
- When a user views a page that displays the label (e.g., in a tooltip or inline), the malicious SVG is rendered, causing the embedded JavaScript code to execute.
