- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Elastic APM agent for Go fails to sanitize sensitive HTTP header details when logging information during an application panic.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Information disclosure of sensitive HTTP header data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker may be able to obtain sensitive information present in HTTP headers when an application using the vulnerable agent panics.
- **Attack vectors**: An application panic which triggers logging via the APM agent.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need any specific capabilities but needs to cause an application using a vulnerable version of the APM agent to panic to trigger the information disclosure. The CVSS score suggests high privileges are required which is likely a mistake.
