**Elastic APM Agent for Go information disclosure (ESA-2021-02)**

The Elastic APM agent for Go can leak sensitive HTTP header information when logging the details during an application panic. Normally, the APM agent will sanitize sensitive HTTP header details before sending the information to the APM server. During an application panic it is possible the headers will not be sanitized before being sent.

Elastic thanks Rob Liebowitz, Senior Software Engineer at Morning Consult for reporting this issue.

**Affected Versions:**

All versions of APM Agent for Go before 1.11.0 are affected by this flaw

**Solutions and Mitigations:**

Anyone using APM Agent for Go should upgrade to version 1.11.0

**CVSSv3** - 2.1: AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N

**CVE ID:** [CVE-2021-22133](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=2021-22133)
