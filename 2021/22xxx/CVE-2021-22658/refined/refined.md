Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied strings before using them to construct SQL queries within the `UserServlet` class of Advantech iView.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- SQL Injection (CWE-89): The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges and reset the password for the Admin user.
- This could allow an attacker to gain full control of the affected system.
- According to CISA, successful exploitation could also allow an attacker to disclose information, perform arbitrary file reads, and remotely execute commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
-  Authentication Bypass: The authentication mechanism can be bypassed, although the provided details are not precise on how this is achieved.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  A low-privileged attacker is needed, implying that the attacker must initially have some access or presence on the network that hosts the vulnerable application.
- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the iView application.
