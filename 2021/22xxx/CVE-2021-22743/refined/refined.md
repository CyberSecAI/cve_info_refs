- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper check for unusual or exceptional conditions when processing malformed TriStation packets.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The affected modules do not properly handle malformed TriStation packets, leading to a potential denial-of-service condition. The vulnerability is triggered only when the write-protect keyswitch is in the "PROGRAM" position.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability results in a module reset, leading to a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited by sending malformed TriStation packets to the affected modules.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs physical access to the affected devices and the ability to send malformed TriStation packets, and needs to be able to set the write-protect keyswitch in the PROGRAM position, which usually requires physical access. The attacker would also likely need knowledge of the TriStation protocol.
