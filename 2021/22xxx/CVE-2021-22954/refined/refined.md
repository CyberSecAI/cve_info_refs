- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The CSRF token was being stored in dynamic Javascript, which could be potentially exposed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Exposure of CSRF token in dynamic javascript.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks. An attacker could potentially perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a logged-in user.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exposed if the CSRF token is accessible through javascript.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be able to induce a user to execute a crafted request, leveraging the exposed CSRF token.

The provided text also mentions mitigations, specifically header configurations to set Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy to either `same-origin` or `same-site` for versions below 9.
The fix in version 9 is to remove the CSRF token from dynamic Javascript.
