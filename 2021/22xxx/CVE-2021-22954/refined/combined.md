## Security Updates

A lot of security updates were put into Version 9 that we kept quiet about when version 9 was released since the fixes were also being put into versions 8.5.6 and 8.5.7 and we embargoed the CVEs until those versions were released. Please check out those release notes which describe which security fixes were also put into version 9.

* Version 9 removed the CSRF token from being stored in dynamic Javascript to remediate CVE-2021-22954.

  Alternate mitigations for versions below 9 are to apply a header configuration applied to nginx/apache. To mitigate set the Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy to either same-origin or same-site, see https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/Cross-Origin\_Resource\_Policy\_(CORP) if unsure which to apply.
  For Nginx: In the location block - add\_header Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-origin";
  Apache: In .htaccess or equivalent - Header set Cross-Origin-Resource-Policy "same-origin"
  Concrete CMS Security Team gave this a CVSS 3.1 score of 4.8 AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:N
  Thanks "Solar Security Research Team" for reporting!

## Backward Compatibility Notes

* If you use `Core::make()`, `$app->make()` or anything similar in your packages, and provide arguments to these classes at the same time, recent updates to the Laravel Container class may break some older code. Please see this tutorial for more information: https://documentation.concretecms.org/tutorials/add-developers-get-your-add-ons-ready-concrete-cms-90
* Beginning in version 8, we added the ability to override core elements from within your themes. For example, if the core requires an element via `View::element(‘conversations/add_post’;` the core looks for this add-on in `concrete/elements/conversations/add_post.php`. However, if the currently active theme provides this element in `themes/my_theme/elements/concrete/conversations/add_post.php`, it will be used instead. We are changing this to remove the `concrete/` directory from the `elements` directory within your theme. That means in order to override any core element from within your theme, you only need to make it available at the same path within the `elements/` directory of your theme.
* If you register custom help for specific pages in your package, make sure to do so from within your package’s `on_start` method rather than from within the Dashboard page. Our new help panel requires this. See https://github.com/concrete5/concrete5/issues/9869#issuecomment-927136592 for more information.
* Console command `c5:blacklist:clear` has been renamed `c5:denylist:clear`
* If you work with Concrete cookies directly in your server configurations, be aware that they have been renamed. The default session cookie has been changed from CONCRETE5 to CONCRETE; the default is-logged-in cookie has been changed from `CONCRETE5_LOGIN` to `CONCRETE_LOGIN`.
