Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22332:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A pointer double free vulnerability exists due to the same memory pointer being copied to two different functional modules when a specific function is called.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Double Free:** The core issue is that the same memory pointer is being freed twice, leading to a double-free condition. This is a classic memory corruption vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Module Crash:** Exploiting the vulnerability leads to a crash of the affected module.
- **Compromised Normal Service:** Module crashes can disrupt normal services provided by the vulnerable devices.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based Attack:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted message to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send crafted network messages to the vulnerable device.
- **No Specific Privileges:** The advisory does not mention any specific user privileges required. The attack appears to be network-based and does not require any special access.
- **Crafted Message:**  The attacker must be able to construct a malicious message that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects several CloudEngine series switches (12800, 5800, 6800, and 7800) across various versions.
- Huawei has released patches to address this issue. Customers are advised to contact Huawei TAC for software updates.
- The CVSSv3 base score is 5.3 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L), indicating a medium severity vulnerability with low attack complexity, no user interaction, and partial impact to availability
- The temporal score is 4.9 (E:F/RL:O/RC:C) meaning that exploit is functional, official fix exists, and the report confidence is confirmed
