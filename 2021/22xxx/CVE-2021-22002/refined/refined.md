Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-22002:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from improper handling of host headers in VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager (vIDM). Specifically, the `/cfg` web application and diagnostic endpoints, typically accessed on port 8443, could be reached via port 443 by manipulating host headers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Host header injection:** The primary vulnerability is the susceptibility to host header tampering, allowing an attacker to bypass intended access restrictions.
*   **Unauthenticated access to diagnostic endpoints:** The vulnerability also allows unauthenticated access to diagnostic endpoints within the `/cfg` web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can gain unauthorized access to the `/cfg` web application and potentially to diagnostic endpoints, which are usually restricted.
*   The vulnerability is rated as 'Important' with a CVSSv3 base score of 8.6.
*   This unauthorized access could lead to further malicious activities, though the specific impacts beyond access to `/cfg` and diagnostic endpoints are not detailed.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the affected system, specifically to port 443.
*   **Host Header Manipulation:** The attacker needs to tamper with the host headers in the HTTP request to redirect access to the restricted `/cfg` web application and diagnostic endpoints through port 443.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to send network traffic to port 443 of the target system.
*   They must also have the technical capability to manipulate HTTP request headers.
*   No authentication is required for initial access to the vulnerable endpoints via the manipulated host header.

**Additional Information from the Content:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   VMware Workspace ONE Access (Access)
    *   VMware Identity Manager (vIDM)
    *   VMware vRealize Automation (vRA) 7.6 (specifically, the embedded vIDM component)
    *   VMware Cloud Foundation (vIDM)
    *   vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager (vIDM)
*   **vRA 7.6 Specifics**: vRealize Automation 7.6 is affected because it uses an embedded vIDM. vRA 8.x is not affected by this vulnerability because it does not use embedded vIDM.
*   **Workaround:** A workaround for vRA 7.6 involves disabling the configuration page of vIDM by modifying the iptables and creating a flag file. This is detailed in the provided knowledge base article.
*   **Patch:** A permanent fix is included in vRealize Automation 7.6 Patch 23 (and later cumulative patches).
*   **Workaround Impact**: The workaround has the effect of disabling the `/cfg/login` page of vIDM but does not impact other functionality of vRA 7.6.
*   The content also provides detailed steps on applying both the workaround and the patch including how to verify the patch is installed.
*   The content highlights other CVEs fixed in the cumulative patches of vRA 7.6 such as CVE-2021-22003, CVE-2021-44228, CVE-2021-45046, VMSA-2022-0011, VMSA-2022-0014, and VMSA-2022-0021
