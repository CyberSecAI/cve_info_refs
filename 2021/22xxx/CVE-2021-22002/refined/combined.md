#### Environment

VMware vRealize Automation 7.6.x

#### Resolution

To resolve the listed issues, install the latest vRealize Automation 7.6 patch with the instructions below.

**Note:** If you wish to deploy this patch using vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager, you will need to use the properly "wrapped" patch file and not the one listed below.  To obtain the wrapped patch for vRealize Automation, log into the patch site here: [Download Broadcom products and software](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article/142814).

The patch files can be large (>5GB) so ensure there are no network policies in place that may prevent transfers of such file sizes.

### Prerequisites

**Note**: Pre-checker should be successful and green to install or rollback a patch.

For successful patch deployments, perform these prerequisite steps on the target vRealize Automation cluster:

* If Database tab within the 5480 VAMI clustering is set to SYNC, convert to ASYNC
* [Ensure that the virtual appliance(s) have their Time Zone set to UTC](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Automation/7.6/com.vmware.vra.install.upgrade.doc/GUID-C5CF55A3-DC19-41F3-B533-870B7540DD78.html)
* Remove old / obsolete nodes from the Distributed Deployment Information Table. For detailed steps, see [Remove a Node from the Distributed Deployment Information Table](https://docs.vmware.com/en/vRealize-Automation/7.5/com.vmware.vra.prepare.use.doc/GUID-8A31C66F-0172-4640-A7C2-09EAFD677274.html) section of vRealize Automation documentation.
* Ensure that **VMware vCloud Automation Center Management Agent** is the latest 7.6 version and is running on all IaaS cluster nodes.
* Ensure 16GB of free space is available for each virtual appliance participating in the cluster for the /dev/sdd1 partition.
* Ensure at least 1024 MB free on 'C:\' for each IaaS node.
* VMware vCloud Automation Center Management Agent service account requirements:
  + Ensure "Log on as a service account" is enabled.
  + Local Administrator
  + Required username format should be in down-level domain format: *domain\username*, e.g. "*vra\administrator*".
* On each vRA appliance, open the /etc/hosts file and locate the entry IPv4 loopback IP Address (127.0.0.1).  Ensure that the Fully Qualified Domain Name of the node is added immediately after 127.0.0.1 and before localhost.

**For example:** 127.0.0.1 FQDN\_HOSTNAME\_OF\_NODE localhost

* Verify that you have taken a snapshot of the vRealize Automation system while it is shut down. This is the preferred method of taking a snapshot. See the recommendation below:

  ### Shutdown/Startup Order of Operations by Component

  | **Shutdown** | **Startup** |
  | --- | --- |
  | Proxy Agents | Primary appliance |
  | Distributed Execution Managers | Secondary appliance |
  | Secondary Manager service | Primary Web node |
  | Primary Manager Services | Secondary Web node |
  | Secondary Web node | Primary MS |
  | Primary Web node | Secondary MS |
  | Secondary appliances | Distributed Execution Managers |
  | Primary appliance | Agents |
* If your environment uses load balancers for high availability, disable traffic to secondary nodes and disable service monitoring until after installing or removing patches and all services are showing **REGISTERED**.
* Obtain the files from below and copy it to the file system available to the browser you use for the vRealize Automation appliance management interface.
  + hf\_install.sql and hf\_rollback.sql are attached as separate downloadable links within this article under **Attachments.**

**Note:**If you attempt to install or remove a patch without all nodes running, the vRealize Automation appliance management interface might become unresponsive. If that happens, contact technical support. Do not attempt to manage patches through other means or use vRealize Automation until you resolve the issue.

## Installation ProcedureSHA256SUM

```
f9dfffa98a8d9acb8af1eb6dd16a234eaa1bdccd03353741c8dc9d1a4aa50044

```

1. Download the file from the Customer Connect and verify the SHA256SUM.
2. Log in to the vRealize Automation appliance management interface (https://*vrealize-automation-appliance-FQDN*:5480) as root.
3. Upload the patch by clicking **vRA Settings** > **Patches** > **Patch Management** > **New Patch** > **Upload**
4. Once the patch uploads successfully, logout of the current VAMI session.
5. Clear browser cache and login to the primary node VAMI again.
6. Navigate to **vRA Settings** > **Patches** > **Patch Management** > **New Patch**
7. A new pre-check box appears.  Click **Run Pre-check**
8. Once the pre-checker is green, click **Install**
9. Select **Done**
10. SSH into the appliance in which hosts the primary (non-replica) role for PSQL.
    1. Only perform this step if you have not done so in a previous Patch install. Run the below shell script followed by a VAMI service restart
       ```
       sh /usr/local/horizon/scripts/HW-137959-Patch.sh

       service vami-lighttp restart

       ```
11. Once the installation is complete and successful, ensure all the services are running.
12. Once complete, run hf\_install.sql and updateview.sqlagainst the IaaS SQL Server database if it is not run in previous HF installations.

## Verification of successful patch installation:

* All **Management Agents** within the Cluster tab now report as 7.6.0.17541
* All **Manager Service** components now report as 7.6.0.17216
* All **Default Web Site** components now report as 7.6.0.17216
* All **DEM** components now report as 7.6.0.17216
* All **Model Manager Data** component now reports as 7.6.0.17216
* The **Installed Patches** tab shows a successful installation.

**Note**: Patch 26 through 29 do not increment vRA component versions.

## Rollback

1. Run hf\_rollback.sql against the IaaS database after reverting to a previous hotfix installation.

### Adding new nodes to a patched vRealize Automation environment

To add new nodes to an existing patched vRealize Automation cluster requires re-running the patch to update the newly added node.

1. Keep the environment in Async replication mode.
2. Deploy a fresh appliance for the environment, click on **Cancel** when the Installation wizard pops after logging into the 5480 appliance management page.
3. Re-join the new node to the primary from the **Cluster**tab
4. From the **Patch**tab on the appliance management page of the primary node, re-initiate the installation of the patch by selecting the patch from the installed patches tab and selecting install. \*Do not upload patch again and attempt fresh install of patch.

Workaround:

## Known Issues

1. If Patch 26 or 27 fails with

```
"35000":"Exception in thread \"main\" java.lang.NoClassDefFoundError
```

1. Run the following command on each node in the cluster

```
rm -f /usr/lib/vcac/tools/config/repo/{log4j-1.2-api-*.jar,log4j-api-*.jar,log4j-core-*.jar,log4j-slf4j-impl-*.jar} && cp -f /usr/lib/vcac/patches/repo/cafe/vcac/wars-core/vcac/WEB-INF/lib/{log4j-1.2-api-2.17.0.jar,log4j-api-2.17.0.jar,log4j-core-2.17.0.jar,log4j-slf4j-impl-2.17.0.jar} /usr/lib/vcac/tools/config/repo
```

2. **shell-ui-app** fails to register properly post installation:

To resolve this issue Restart vRealize Automation services:
### Standalone

1. SSH into the appliance
2. Execute the following command to stop / restart vcac-server:
   ```
   service vcac-server stop

   ```
3. Start Services:
   ```
   service vcac-server start
   ```

### Clustered

1. SSH into each replica appliance node and stop services:
   ```
   service vcac-server stop
   ```
2. SSH into the primary appliance node and stop services:
   ```
   service vcac-server stop
   ```
3. Start services on the primary node:
   ```
   service vcac-server start
   ```
4. Once the primary node has entered: "Waiting for application to start..." start the replica appliances, the order does not matter:
   ```
   service vcac-server start
   ```
5. Monitor the **Services** tab within the appliance management interface.

2. Patch pre-checker fails during vRealize Automation 7.6 Patch 2+ or below patch installation done using LCM and overall install patch request fails in LCM.

* Reason:  vRealize Automation 7.6 Patch 2+ has a patch pre-checker. This fails if there are anomalies in the vRealize Automation instance. LCM reports total failure for patch request but the pre-check result is not visible in LCM UI
  + Workaround:  Fix the failures reported by the prechecker, found in the VA node at the location /usr/lib/vcac/patches/repo/patch\_installation\_details.json and retry the failed request from LCM.

3. If a Precheck failed error occurs for the Xenon-Service or release-management service perform the following:
   ```
   service xenon-service start && service tekton-server start
   ```

#### Issue/Introduction

CVE-2021-22002 has been determined to affect vRealize Automation 7.6. This vulnerability and its impact on VMware products are documented in VMSA-2021-0016. The [VMSA-2021-0016](https://support.broadcom.com/web/ecx/support-content-notification/-/external/content/SecurityAdvisories/0/23608) corresponds to a vulnerability about VMware Workspace ONE Access/VMware Identity Manager(vIDM). vRealize Automation 7.6 embeds vIDM within vRA 7.6.

Table: Affected Product Versions:

| **Product Component** | **Version(s)** | **Guest Operating System** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| vRealize Automation (vIDM) | 7.6 | Linux |

**The affected product versions are limited to the appliance only. The connector is not impacted.**

Independent Workspace ONE Access/vIDM environments follow a different procedure to address HW-137959. Please follow this this [link](https://kb.omnissa.com/s/article/85254) for details on addressing HW-137959 on independent Workspace ONE Access/vIDM environments. The below details for a workaround of HW-137959 only applies to vRA 7.6 appliances.

**Note:** CVE-2021-22002 will be addressed in the cumulative patch cycle for vRA 7.6. Follow this [link](https://knowledge.broadcom.com/external/article?legacyId=70911) for the last details on the vRA 7.6 cumulative patch.

#### Environment

VMware vRealize Automation 7.6.x

#### Resolution

The workaround addresses the vulnerability identified against the reported CVE: CVE-2021-22002.
workaround deployment steps, and how to confirm the workaround is applied.

**Before You Begin:**

* Take the snapshot without virtual memory (recommended)
* Download the workaround script

| **Product** | **Version(s)** |
| --- | --- |
| vRealize Automation (vIDM) | 7.6 |

**Resolution:**
Install the workaround to address the vulnerability identified against the reported CVE: CVE-2021-22002.
Deployment of the workaround will take approximately 10 mins to apply for each appliance. The workaround can be deployed independently and will not require all vRA appliances to be offline at the same time. Therefore, the deployment of the workaround can be accomplished in a rolling fashion without taking the entire vRA environment offline.

**Workaround Impact:**
The workaround disables the ability to resolve the configuration page of vIDM. This endpoint is not used in vRA 7.6 environments and will not cause any impact to functionality.

**Workaround Deployment Procedures:**
Linux Virtual Appliance Procedure

1. Login to the appliance with sshuser user and switch to root user
2. Copy HW-137959-vRA.zip to the appliance. Place the file in a location easily accessible by root user.
   1. VMware recommends SCP protocol to deliver the file to the appliance. Tools such as winscp can be used to transfer the file to the appliance
3. Unzip the file using below command.

CMD: **unzip HW-137959-vRA.zip**

4. Navigate to the files within the unzipped folder

CMD: **cd HW-137959-vRA**

5. Run the workaround script using below command from terminal

CMD: **./HW-137959-Workaround.sh**

6. Evaluate the warning of creating a backup before proceeding.
   1. Type ‘y’ and press <Enter> to continue
7. Wait up to 5 minutes for the workaround to be applied
8. To validate the workaround was applied on the appliance, attempt to launch the configuration login page. The expected behavior is this page will not be available.

Example: https://*fqdn\_of\_appliance*:8443/cfg/login

**Note:** If you are on the wrong version of vRA you will be presented with the following error: "This hotfix is only applicable to be run on 7.x.x"

**Note:** If you are running multi-appliance deployment, repeat the above steps on each additional appliance within the environment.

**Rollback Deployment Procedures:**
If there is a failure during the workaround deployment process and there is no backup available to revert to, the following steps can be taken to rollback the workaround. These steps would need to be taken on each impacted appliance.
Linux Virtual Appliance Procedure

1. Replace the iptables file with the backup file created during workaround deployment.
CMD: **mv /etc/bootstrap/everyboot.d/03-vidm-cluster-access-iptables.bk /etc/bootstrap/everyboot.d/03-vidm-cluster-access-iptables**

2. Run the below script to update the iptable rules.
CMD: **/etc/bootstrap/everyboot.d/03-vidm-cluster-access-iptables**

3. Remove the Flag File.
CMD:  **rm -f /usr/local/horizon/conf/flags/HW-137959-7.6.0.applied**

4. To validate the workaround was applied on the appliance, attempt to launch the configuration login page. The expected behavior is this page will be available.

Example: https://<fqdn\_of\_appliance>:8443/cfg/login

##### **1. Impacted Products**

* VMware Workspace ONE Access (Access)
* VMware Identity Manager (vIDM)
* VMware vRealize Automation (vRA)
* VMware Cloud Foundation (Cloud Foundation)
* vRealize Suite Lifecycle Manager

##### **2. Introduction**

Multiple vulnerabilities were privately reported to VMware. Patches and workarounds are available to address these vulnerabilities in affected VMware products.

##### **3a. Host header tampering leading to server side request on internal restricted service (CVE-2021-22002)**

**Description**

VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager, allow the /cfg web app and diagnostic endpoints, on port 8443, to be accessed via port 443 using a custom host header. VMware has evaluated this issue to be of '[Important](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html)' severity with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [8.6](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:L).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with network access to port 443 could tamper with host headers to facilitate access to the /cfg web app, in addition a malicious actor could access /cfg diagnostic endpoints without authentication.

**Resolution**

Fixes for CVE-2021-22002 are documented in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Workarounds**

Workarounds for CVE-2021-22002 are documented in the 'Workarounds' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Additional Documentation**

[KB70911](https://kb.vmware.com/s/article/70911) "Cumulative Update for vRealize Automation 7.6" provides a link to download vRealize Automation 7.6 Patch 23, which includes a fix for this vulnerability.

**Notes**

[1] vRealize Automation 7.6 is affected since it uses embedded vIDM.

[2] vRealize Automation 8.x is unaffected since it does not use embedded vIDM. If vIDM has been deployed with vRA 8.x, fixes should be applied directly to vIDM.

**Acknowledgements**

VMware would like to thank Suleyman Bayir of Trendyol and Mehmet İnce of PRODAFT SARL for reporting this issue to us.

##### **3b. Information Disclosure Vulnerability (CVE-2021-22003)**

**Description**

VMware Workspace ONE Access and Identity Manager, unintentionally provide a login interface on port 7443. VMware has evaluated this issue to be of '[Low](https://www.vmware.com/support/policies/security_response.html)' severity with a maximum CVSSv3 base score of [3.7](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N).

**Known Attack Vectors**

A malicious actor with network access to port 7443 may attempt user enumeration or brute force the login endpoint, which may or may not be practical based on lockout policy configuration and password complexity for the target account.

**Resolution**

Fixes for CVE-2021-22003 are documented in the 'Fixed Version' column of the 'Response Matrix' below.

**Workarounds**

None.

**Additional Documentation**

None.

**Notes**

[2] vRealize Automation 8.x is unaffected since it does not use embedded vIDM. If vIDM has been deployed with vRA 8.x, fixes should be applied directly to vIDM.

**Acknowledgements**

None.
