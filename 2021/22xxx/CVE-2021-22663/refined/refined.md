- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files, leading to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors:** By providing a crafted project file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious project file to the vulnerable software. The attacker needs no special privileges, but the user must open the malicious project file.
