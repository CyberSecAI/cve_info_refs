  "CVE-2021-22876": {
    "description": "libcurl does not strip off user credentials from the URL when automatically populating the `Referer:` HTTP request header field in outgoing HTTP requests, and therefore risks leaking sensitive data to the server that is the target of the second HTTP request.",
    "root_cause": "libcurl was not sanitizing URLs to remove credentials before using them to populate the Referer header.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Exposure of Private Personal Information to an Unauthorized Actor (CWE-359)",
      "Leaking of credentials in the HTTP Referer header."
    ],
    "impact": "Credentials present in the URL could be leaked to the server of the second HTTP request via the Referer header.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending an HTTP request that leads to an automatic population of the Referer header to a second HTTP request."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker able to trigger an automatic referer with a URL containing credentials can potentially cause the credentials to leak.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is triggered when the CURLOPT_AUTOREFERER option is enabled. The curl tool enables this with the '--referer \";auto\"' option. The issue exists in curl versions from 7.1.1 to 7.75.0 inclusive. The fix blanks out credentials before using the URL to populate the header field."
