    "description": "The provided content describes a vulnerability in GitLab related to stealing OAuth access tokens using XSLeaks and Cross-Origin Redirects, specifically affecting Safari browsers. This aligns with the need to PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the behavior of OAuth redirects in GitLab and how Safari handles Cross-Origin redirects. After a user authorizes an application with GitLab OAuth, subsequent login attempts bypass the authorization dialog and directly redirect to the third-party app with access tokens. This redirection is Cross-Origin, from gitlab.com to the third-party, allowing the access token to be captured through a SecurityPolicyViolationEvent when a request is made to the `gitlab.com/oauth/authorize` endpoint.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Cross-Origin redirect vulnerability",
        "Information leakage through SecurityPolicyViolationEvent",
         "Lack of proper handling of Cross-Origin redirects in Safari."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to steal OAuth access tokens, potentially leading to Account Takeover (ATO).",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Attacker crafts a malicious link that triggers the OAuth authorization flow to redirect to an attacker-controlled site",
         "Attacker lures a user (who already authorized an application via Gitlab OAuth) to visit the malicious link."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with a valid `client_id` and `redirect_uri` that initiates the GitLab OAuth authorization flow. The attacker needs to convince the victim to click the malicious link. The user should already authorized a gitlab application to be targeted."
