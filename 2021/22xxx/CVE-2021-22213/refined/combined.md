# Stealing gitlab oauth access tokens using XSLeaks Cross-Origin Redirects - CSP Violations in Safari

**[HackerOne report #1089277](https://hackerone.com/reports/1089277)** by `hubblebubble` on 2021-01-28, assigned to [@vdesousa](/vdesousa "Vitor Meireles De Sousa"):

[Report](#report) | [Attachments](#attachments) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

Abstract:

This is basically a zero-click exploit to steal login with gitlab oauth tokens on Safari. I have tested it on the Safari 13.1.1, Safari 12.1.2 and it works there with default browser settings whereas on the Safari (Safari 14, Safari 13.1.2) the exploit works if "Prevent Cross-Site Tracking" is disabled.

Bug Details:

When a user first clicks on a Login with gitlab button, the user is displayed a dialog box where the user has to authorize that particular app. Once that particular app has been authorized, a 302 redirection is made to the 3rd-party website with access tokens. Now once that app has been authorized, in the future whenever the user clicks on the login with gitlab button, the dialog box is not displayed and directly a 302 redirection is made to the 3rd-party website along with access tokens.

The redirection here is Cross-Origin meaning from gitlab.com to 3rd-party website, so when a request is made to

<https://gitlab.com/oauth/authorize?client_id=client-id&redirect_uri=example.com>

it redirects to <https://example.com/?code=access-token> which triggers a SecurityPolicyViolationEvent where the URL where redirection happens can be captured through SecurityPolicyViolationEvent.documentURI in Safari.

You can read more about this at <https://xsleaks.dev/docs/attacks/navigations/#cross-origin-redirects>

POC:

Here for the sake of POC we will steal access-token that will be generated when using login with gitlab for <https://forum.gitlab.com>

1. Use a gitlab account that has already authorized forum.gitlab.com app.
2. Then Simply visit this URL

```

```

3. You will see an alert box with a stolen access token :)

#### Impact

We can steal access tokens potentially allowing ATO :)
