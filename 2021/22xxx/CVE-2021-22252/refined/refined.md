{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "A branch with the same name as a protected tag inherits the privileges of the protected tag during pipeline execution.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect privilege assignment for pipelines triggered by branches with names matching protected tags",
       "Lack of proper separation between branch and tag execution contexts",
       "Inadequate authorization checks for accessing protected environment variables"
    ],
    "impact": "Unauthorized access to sensitive environment variables (e.g., database passwords, private keys) leading to potential compromise of the production environment.",
    "attack_vectors": {
      "vector": "A project member with the 'Developer' role, who can create branches, can create a branch with the same name as a protected tag. This triggers the pipeline with elevated permissions, allowing them to access protected environment variables.",
      "required_capabilities": [
        "Project member with 'Developer' role",
        "Ability to create branches",
        "Knowledge of protected tag names"
      ]
    },
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that pipelines for branches with the same names as protected tags are treated as if they were pipelines from the protected tags themselves. This is further aggravated by the fact that the attacker can modify the .gitlab-ci.yml file to exfiltrate the obtained secrets. This allows developers, who are normally restricted from viewing these variables, to access protected CI/CD variables that should only be accessible to 'Managers' or 'Owners'."
