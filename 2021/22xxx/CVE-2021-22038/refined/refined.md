- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The uninstaller binary copies itself to a fixed, non-randomized temporary location without restricting access to administrators.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Binary planting vulnerability due to the use of a fixed, predictable temporary location for the uninstaller binary during uninstallation, and lack of access restrictions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can replace the copied uninstaller binary with a malicious one, achieving arbitrary code execution with the security scope of the uninstaller.
- **Attack vectors:** Requires prior access to the machine and monitoring the temporary directory to intercept the uninstaller binary
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs prior access to the system and must be able to monitor the temporary directory to replace the legitimate uninstaller binary before execution.
