      "root_cause": "A flaw in the option parser for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based buffer to the server, resulting in potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using a clear-text network protocol. This occurs because curl did not check the return code from a sscanf() function invoke correctly.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper handling of sscanf return code",
        "Use of uninitialized stack-based buffer",

        "Malicious TELNET server",
        "Specially crafted NEW_ENV option in curl"
