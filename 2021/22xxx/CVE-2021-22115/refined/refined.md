Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-22115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Cloud Controller API (CAPI) logs service broker credentials in plain text when the default database logging configuration is changed. Specifically, the password is included when a job to clean up orphaned items is executed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Plaintext Logging of Credentials:** The primary weakness is logging service broker passwords in plain text instead of redacting or encrypting them.
*   **Insecure Default Configuration:** The vulnerability is triggered by modifying a default database logging configuration, suggesting an insecure default or a lack of proper hardening considerations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access to Service Brokers:** A malicious user who gains access to the CAPI logs can obtain the service broker password.
*   **Potential Data Breach or System Compromise:**  With access to service broker credentials, attackers can potentially gain access to the resources managed by those brokers, leading to further breaches or compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Log Access:** The attack vector relies on gaining access to the CAPI logs where the plaintext passwords are stored.
*  **Configuration Change:** The logging of the credentials is triggered by a specific configuration change to the database logging.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to CAPI Logs:** The attacker must have access to the CAPI logs, which might involve compromising the log storage system or gaining access through other vulnerabilities.
*   **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** While not strictly required, understanding that changing the default logging config will expose the service broker passwords would make it easier to find this specific vulnerability.

**Summary**

CVE-2021-22115 describes a vulnerability where service broker credentials are inadvertently logged in plaintext by Cloud Foundry's CAPI. This occurs when the database logging configuration is changed from the default. An attacker with access to these logs could potentially compromise the service brokers and their associated resources. The vulnerability has been addressed in CAPI version 1.106.0 and CF Deployment version 16.2.0.
