- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An open redirect vulnerability exists in the UAA server.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The UAA server does not properly validate redirect URLs, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an arbitrary malicious site.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can use social engineering to trick users into clicking a malicious link, potentially leading to the takeover of user accounts or redirection to malicious sites.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited via specially crafted URLs that redirect users to attacker-controlled sites.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and use social engineering to trick users into clicking them.
