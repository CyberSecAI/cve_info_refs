  "vulnerability": {
    "cve": "CVE-2021-22180",
    "details": "Analytics pages are visible to non-members in public projects despite the setting being configured to `Only Project Members`. This occurs because the analytics pages can be accessed directly via their URLs even when the analytics menu is not visible to non-members.",
    "affected_components": [
      "Analytics feature in GitLab"
    ],
    "root_cause": "The application fails to properly enforce the `Only Project Members` setting for analytics pages when accessed directly via their URLs. Although the analytics menu is hidden for non-members, the underlying URLs for these pages are still accessible.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Inadequate access control",
      "Direct object reference vulnerability"
    ],
   "attack_vectors": [
      "Directly accessing analytics URLs",
       "Bypassing UI restrictions on analytics pages"
    ],
    "impact": "Information disclosure of project analytics data to unauthorized users (non-project members).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be a non-member user of the public project. The attacker requires knowledge of the URL paths to the analytics pages.",
    "additional_info": "The vulnerability was discovered in GitLab Enterprise Edition 13.8.0-pre 2fb64612ef2, however it's likely present in other versions as well"
