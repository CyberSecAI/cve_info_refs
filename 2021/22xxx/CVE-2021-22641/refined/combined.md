# Advisory Details

January 29th, 2021
## Fuji Electric V-Server Lite VPR File Parsing Heap-based Buffer Overflow Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-099ZDI-CAN-11669

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-22641](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-22641) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | [Fuji Electric](https://www.fujielectric.com) |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | V-Server Lite |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Fuji Electric V-Server Lite. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of VPR files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data prior to copying it to a heap-based buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |
| ADDITIONAL DETAILS | Fuji Electric has issued an update to correct this vulnerability. More details can be found at: |
