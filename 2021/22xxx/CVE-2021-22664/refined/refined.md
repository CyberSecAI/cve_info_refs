Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22664:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the parsing of DPA files within Delta Industrial Automation's CNCSoft-B DOPSoft.
- The issue stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing process.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787):**  Improper input validation allows for writing data beyond the allocated buffer, leading to memory corruption.
   - There's also a closely related **Out-of-bounds read (CWE-125)** vulnerability reported as CVE-2021-22660 that is described alongside it, but they are distinct issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: By writing past the end of a buffer, an attacker can overwrite critical memory regions, potentially leading to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious DPA file: The attacker needs to craft a malicious DPA file that, when opened or processed by the vulnerable software, triggers the out-of-bounds write.
- Malicious web page: The advisory also mentions that the target could be lured to a malicious page to exploit the vulnerability, implying there may be a way to trigger file parsing through a browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- User interaction is required. The user must either open a specially crafted malicious file or visit a malicious web page.
- The attacker would need the ability to deliver a malicious DPA file or web page to the target system.
- No special privileges are required, as the vulnerability is triggered within the context of the user running the application.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects CNCSoft-B versions 1.0.0.3 and prior.
- Delta Electronics has released an update (version 1.0.0.4 or later) to correct the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by Natnael Samson (@NattiSamson) working with Trend Micro's Zero Day Initiative.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
- This vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
