{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application's javascript code copies data from the clipboard without sanitizing it and then uses it to set the innerHTML property of a div element.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "DOM-based Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code under the user's credentials, which could be used to perform actions on behalf of the user, steal credentials, or other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts malicious HTML content and sets it to the 'text/x-gfm-html' MIME type in the clipboard. When a user pastes this content into a vulnerable text field, the malicious code gets executed.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control the clipboard content of a user. This could be achieved by tricking the user to copy malicious content from a website controlled by the attacker."
