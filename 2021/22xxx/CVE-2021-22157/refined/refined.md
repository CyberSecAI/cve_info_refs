- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Proofpoint Insider Threat Management Server (formerly ObserveIT Server) has multiple stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in the Web Console.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored cross-site scripting (XSS). The script executes within the context of an admin user.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in the context of an admin user's session, potentially leading to account compromise, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by an unauthenticated remote attacker. It requires coordination with the interactions of multiple users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected server and somehow influence the interaction of multiple users.
