- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the lack of CSRF token verification when cloning topics in the sitemap.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could potentially duplicate topics, which could lead to UI inconvenience and potentially exhaust disk space.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves tricking a logged-in user into performing an unintended action (cloning a topic) through a malicious request from a different origin.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into submitting a crafted request. The attacker does not need to be authenticated but does need the user to be.
