- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds array access in the kernel.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds array access.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation may cause stability risks.
- **Attack vectors**: Not specified, but likely involves triggering the vulnerable code path in the kernel through a crafted input or operation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Not specified, but would require the ability to interact with the vulnerable kernel component.
