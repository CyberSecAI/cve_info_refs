CVE-2017-4965

    Several forms in the RabbitMQ management UI are vulnerable to XSS
    attacks.

CVE-2017-4966

    RabbitMQ management UI stores signed-in user credentials in a
    browser's local storage without expiration, making it possible to
    retrieve them using a chained attack

    Several forms in the RabbitMQ management UI are vulnerable to XSS
    attacks.

CVE-2019-11281

    The virtual host limits page, and the federation management UI,
    which do not properly sanitize user input. A remote authenticated
    malicious user with administrative access could craft a cross site
    scripting attack that would gain access to virtual hosts and
    policy management information

CVE-2019-11287

    The "X-Reason" HTTP Header can be leveraged to insert a malicious
    Erlang format string that will expand and consume the heap,
    resulting in the server crashing.
