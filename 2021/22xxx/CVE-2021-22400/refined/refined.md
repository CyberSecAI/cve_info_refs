- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient input validation due to lack of parameter validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Lack of parameter validation in some Huawei smartphones.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can cause the system to crash by exploiting this vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to trick a user into installing a malicious app which then modifies specific parameters to trigger the crash.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to create and distribute a malicious application and convince the user to install it. The attacker also needs to be able to identify and modify the vulnerable parameters.
