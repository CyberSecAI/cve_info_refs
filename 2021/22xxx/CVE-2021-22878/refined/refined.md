Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-22878:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of sanitization in the `OC.Notification.show` function within Nextcloud. Specifically, user-controlled input, such as a filename, is not properly sanitized before being displayed, leading to a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The primary weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability. This means the malicious script is injected into the application through a user's action (e.g., renaming a file) and is reflected back to the user in the application's response, causing the browser to execute it.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize the filename before using it in the `OC.Notification.show` function. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code into the notification.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the victim's browser session, within the context of the Nextcloud application.
*   **Account Hijacking:** By executing malicious JavaScript, an attacker could potentially steal session cookies, access sensitive user data, or perform actions on behalf of the victim, potentially leading to account compromise or other malicious activities.
*   **Phishing and Social Engineering:** Attackers can use XSS to redirect users to malicious sites, display fake login forms, or inject other malicious content designed to trick users.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Filename Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through the file renaming functionality. An attacker can create or rename a file with a malicious payload in its name. When a user interacts with this file (e.g., attempts to rename it again with an invalid name), the payload is triggered.
*   **User Interaction:** The attack requires user interaction. A user must trigger the notification by attempting to rename a file with a malicious name, or in some other manner which utilizes the `OC.Notification.show` function

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Nextcloud Access:** An attacker needs to have an account on the targeted Nextcloud instance to be able to upload or rename files.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** An attacker needs to understand how `OC.Notification.show` is used and that it doesn't sanitize input to craft a working exploit.

**Additional Details:**
*   The provided Github content shows that the issue was fixed in pull request #25234, which includes a commit that addresses the encoding issue with the `OC.Notification.show` function.
*   The fix was backported to stable versions of Nextcloud
*   The vulnerability is explicitly mentioned in the Fedora update notice, tying it to the Nextcloud update to version 20.0.10.
