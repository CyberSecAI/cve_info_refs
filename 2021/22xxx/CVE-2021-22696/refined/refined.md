      "cve": "CVE-2021-22696",
      "is_related": true,
      "summary": "The Apache CXF OAuth 2 authorization service is vulnerable to DDoS attacks. It does not validate the 'request_uri' parameter and makes a REST request to retrieve a token, which can be abused to trigger a DDoS.",
      "details": "CXF supports passing OAuth 2 parameters via a JWT token using the JwtRequestCodeFilter, as defined in the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework. Instead of using the 'request' parameter to send the JWT, the 'request_uri' parameter specifies a URI to retrieve the JWT token. CXF was not validating the 'request_uri' parameter, apart from ensuring it used 'https', and was making a REST request to the provided URI. This made CXF vulnerable to DDoS attacks on the authorization server by submitting a large number of requests with an attacker controlled 'request_uri' parameter.",
      "affected_components": [
        "Apache CXF OAuth 2 authorization service"

      "root_cause": "Lack of proper validation of the 'request_uri' parameter when retrieving JWT tokens.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Denial of Service (DoS)"
      ],
      "impact": "A successful attack can lead to a Denial-of-Service (DoS) by making the authorization server unavailable due to resource exhaustion. This can significantly impact users attempting to access authorized services.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Sending malicious requests with a crafted 'request_uri' parameter to the OAuth 2 authorization service."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the authorization server and have knowledge of the OAuth 2 parameters. No user authentication is required.",
      "additional_information": "This issue affects Apache CXF versions prior to 3.4.3 and prior to 3.3.10.  The 'request_uri' parameter is specified in section 10.4.1 of the OAuth 2.0 Authorization Framework specification."
