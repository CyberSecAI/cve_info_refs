{
  "CVE-2021-22253": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that even after a user is removed from a project, their access to trigger deployments to protected environments is not revoked, and the maintainer is unable to remove the user from the protected environment settings.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Inadequate access control",
       "Failure to revoke permissions upon user removal",
      "Lack of synchronization between project membership and protected environment access"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "A user who is removed from a project can still trigger deployments to protected environments, potentially disrupting the project's deployment process and affecting its users and data. The user can redeploy old deployment versions too. Also, Maintainers cannot revoke the access via project settings.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the GitLab web interface. A user who was previously a member of a project, even after being removed, can navigate to the environments page and trigger deployments.",
     "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have been a member of the project with deployment permissions to a protected environment. After being removed from the project, they can still exploit the vulnerability."
