- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a flaw that allows bypassing user authentication.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Broken authentication leading to unauthorized access to the CMDB (Configuration Management Database) application.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows remote attackers to bypass authentication and gain unauthorized access to parts of the CMDB application. The CVSS score indicates high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access (AV:N), low attack complexity (AC:L), no required privileges (PR:N), and no user interaction (UI:N)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service. No specific privileges are required.
