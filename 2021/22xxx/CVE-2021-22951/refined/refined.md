- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unauthorized access to password-protected files via the `view_inline` feature.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control, specifically, the system failed to check if a file was password-protected before rendering it inline using the `view_inline` feature.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Unauthorized individuals could view the content of password-protected files.
- **Attack vectors:** Accessing the `view_inline` feature of the file manager.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special privileges or positions are required. The attacker only needs access to the application and know the path to the password-protected file.
