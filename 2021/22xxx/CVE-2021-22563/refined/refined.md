Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read in the `libjxl` library when processing invalid JPEG XL images, specifically during spline rendering.
- The `segment_y_start` array was not correctly sized according to the rendered image dimensions, leading to the read past the end of this array when `image_rect.y0()` returned a higher value than the size of the `segment_y_start` array.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Out-of-bounds read vulnerability in `jxl::N_AVX2::(anonymous namespace)::DrawSegment` function, specifically in splines.cc.
- Incorrect initialization of draw cache dimensions in `Splines::InitializeDrawCache`.
- Insufficient bounds checking when accessing the `segment_y_start` array using `image_rect.y0()` as an index.
-  The code assumes `image_rect.y0()` is always within the bounds of `segment_y_start`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A crafted, invalid JPEG XL image can trigger an out-of-bounds read.
- This can lead to a segmentation fault (segfault), causing the application to crash.
- It could also cause the program to read and utilize other process memory during spline rendering, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By providing a specially crafted, invalid JPEG XL image to an application using the vulnerable `libjxl` library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted JPEG XL image to the application using `libjxl`.

**Additional Details:**

- The issue was found through fuzz testing by the libvips project.
- The vulnerability is located in `lib/jxl/splines.cc`.
- The vulnerable code is in the `DrawSegment` function in `jxl::N_AVX2::(anonymous namespace)`.
- The issue was fixed by initializing the draw cache with correct dimensions. This ensures `image_rect.y0()` is smaller than the size of `segment_y_start`.
- The fix was implemented in pull request #757 and commit `bb6599932572ed24dbd68b0ea460acbf8d92884e`
- A temporary patch was initially proposed as a possible guard to prevent the segfault, but the root cause was later addressed.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-22563.

This information is more detailed than the official CVE description which only mentions "Invalid JPEG XL images using libjxl can cause an out of bounds access on a std::vector<std::vector> when rendering splines. The OOB read access can either lead to a segfault, or rendering splines based on other process memory.".
