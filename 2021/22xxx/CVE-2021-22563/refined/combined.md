| Good catch! Spline rendering was recently optimized, so this is probably a result of that.  [@veluca93](https://github.com/veluca93) is there an earlier point where this can be prevented? Otherwise the suggested fix looks good enough, at least as a quick patch. Should probably backport it to the 0.6 branch too, decoder segfault is a rather severe bug after all. |

| image\_rect.y0() really ought to be smaller than segment\_y\_start\_ in all cases, it is probably better to fix that... [@sboukortt](https://github.com/sboukortt) too |

| Not yet fully sure what is happening but `Splines::InitializeDrawCache` is first called with an image size of 46×252, and then `AddTo` is called on 48×1 rects (`x0` = 8 for `opsin_rect`, 0 for `image_rect`) of varying `y0` on a 304×292 opsin image. For what it’s worth, `jxlinfo` indicates that it’s a 37×37 JXL file. |
