  "CVE-2021-22872": {
    "description": "The fix for a reflected XSS vulnerability in REVIVE-SA-2020-001 could be bypassed on older browsers with specifically crafted payloads to the publicly accessible afr.php delivery script of Revive Adserver.",
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input sanitization in the afr.php script when handling parameters in older browsers.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the afr.php page, potentially leading to client-side attacks such as session hijacking, defacement, or information theft.",
    "attack_vectors": "By crafting malicious URLs with specific payloads that are not automatically URL-encoded by older browsers, an attacker can inject script tags into the page when the afr.php script processes the request.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to craft a specific payload that bypasses previous fixes on older browsers. The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the system other than the ability to send a crafted URL request to the vulnerable afr.php script. User interaction (clicking on the crafted URL) is required."
