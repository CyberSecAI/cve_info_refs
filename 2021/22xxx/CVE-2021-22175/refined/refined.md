  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The CI Lint API allows unauthenticated access for validating YAML syntax. This API can be abused using remote includes in the YAML, allowing an attacker to make external network requests.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated API endpoint",
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to remote includes",
      "Information disclosure via origin IP and User-Agent"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform internal network requests if the administrator allows internal requests with webhooks. This can also be abused to scan ports on remote targets. Furthermore, the origin IP address and User-Agent of the GitLab instance can be disclosed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Abuse of unauthenticated CI Lint API with remote includes",
       "Crafted .gitlab-ci.yml using 'include: remote:' to trigger a request to an arbitrary server"
    ],
   "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious `.gitlab-ci.yml` file with a `remote` include to an arbitrary server, and use the unauthenticated CI Lint API endpoint to validate the syntax. No authentication required."
