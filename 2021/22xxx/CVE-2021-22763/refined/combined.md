Note regarding vulnerability details: The severity of vulnerabilities was calculated using the CVSS Base metrics
in version 3.1 (CVSS v3.1) without incorporating the Temporal and Environmental metrics. Schneider Electric
recommends that customers score the CVSS Environmental metrics, which are specific to end-user
organizations, and consider factors such as the presence of mitigations in that environment. Environmental
metrics may refine the relative severity posed by the vulnerabilities described in this document within a
customer’s environment.

General Security Recommendations

We strongly recommend the following industry cybersecurity best practices.

•  Locate control and safety system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from

•

the business network.
Install physical controls so no unauthorized personnel can access your industrial control and safety
systems, components, peripheral equipment, and networks.

•  Place all controllers in locked cabinets and never leave them in the “Program” mode.
•  Never connect programming software to any network other than the network intended for that device.
•  Scan all methods of mobile data exchange with the isolated network such as CDs, USB drives, etc.

before use in the terminals or any node connected to these networks.

•  Never allow mobile devices that have connected to any other network besides the intended network to

connect to the safety or control networks without proper sanitation.

•  Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and systems and ensure that they are not

accessible from the Internet.

Schneider Electric Security Notification

•  When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs).
Recognize that VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version
available. Also, understand that VPNs are only as secure as the connected devices.

For more information refer to the Schneider Electric Recommended Cybersecurity Best Practices document.
