```json
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The GraphQL endpoint does not enforce the same access restrictions as the REST API for deactivated users.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Inconsistent access control enforcement between different API endpoints (REST vs. GraphQL)",
      "Failure to properly restrict API access for deactivated users"
    ],
    "impact": "A deactivated user can still access data through the GraphQL API, bypassing intended restrictions. This could lead to unauthorized data access, potential misuse of deactivated accounts, and resource consumption without proper billing. It also risks an admin not knowing the user is using the API and deletion of the account without warning.",
    "attack_vectors": "Direct API requests to the GraphQL endpoint using a token from a deactivated user. The vulnerability can be exploited by users with deactivated accounts and by admins creating deactivated accounts as 'bots' or 'service accounts'.",
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs a valid API token for a deactivated user.  In versions prior to the fix, mutation operations could be performed, if the attacker had an API token and was part of a project."
