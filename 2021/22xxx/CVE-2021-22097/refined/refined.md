- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `toString()` method of the Spring AMQP Message object deserializes the message body when the content type is `application/x-java-serialized-object`. This deserialization process trusts classes in `java.lang` and `java.util` packages and doesn't properly handle maliciously crafted objects.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes objects from untrusted sources without proper validation, leading to a potential vulnerability.
    - **Denial of Service:** A specifically crafted `java.util.Dictionary` object can cause a denial of service (DoS) by triggering 100% CPU usage.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the application to consume 100% CPU by sending a malicious message.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - **Message Injection:** The attacker needs to publish messages with the content type `application/x-java-serialized-object` and a malicious `java.util.Dictionary` object as the message body to the RabbitMQ server.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker must have privileges to publish arbitrary messages to the RabbitMQ server.
