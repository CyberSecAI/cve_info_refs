**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The content includes a security advisory specifically for `CVE-2021-22147` titled "Elasticsearch Vulnerability in NetApp Products". The advisory also provides a link to the Elastic Stack security update which also references the CVE, confirming its relevance.
   - The advisory states: "A flaw was discovered in Elasticsearch where document and field level security was not applied to searchable snapshots. This could lead to an authenticated user gaining access to information that they are unauthorized to view."

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a flaw in Elasticsearch where document and field level security was not being properly applied when using searchable snapshots. This means that access control mechanisms were not functioning correctly in certain circumstances.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Improper access control:** The core vulnerability is the failure to apply document and field-level security policies on searchable snapshots. This leads to an access control bypass.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   -  **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** An authenticated user can potentially gain access to sensitive information that they are not authorized to view.
   
**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector involves the use of **searchable snapshots** feature within Elasticsearch.
   - An attacker would need to be an **authenticated user** within the Elasticsearch environment to exploit the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    -  **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account that allows them to interact with the Elasticsearch instance.
    -  **Knowledge of Searchable Snapshots:** The attacker would need to be aware of how to use searchable snapshots within Elasticsearch.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided NetApp advisory indicates that no NetApp products are affected by this CVE, despite using Elasticsearch. This is because the vulnerability was found in Elasticsearch itself, not the way NetApp products use it.
- The Elastic advisory for this CVE provides more details than the provided NetApp content, specifically mentioning searchable snapshots, which clarifies the vulnerability further.
- The CVSS v3 score is 6.5 (MEDIUM) with vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` indicating a network-based attack, with low attack complexity, requiring low level of privileges, no user interaction, and a high impact on confidentiality.
