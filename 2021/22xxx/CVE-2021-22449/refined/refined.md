- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Insufficient security design in the Huawei WATCH Kid product.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A logic vulnerability that allows an unauthenticated attacker to perform specific operations. The primary weakness is that the device does not properly validate friend requests or has insufficient prompts for such actions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can add users to the friend list of a target device without prompting the device user for approval. This potentially allows for unauthorized monitoring or interaction with the target device user.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs to be on the same network as the target device. The attack is performed by exploiting the logic flaw through specific operations.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be able to access the target device's network and perform specific operations exploiting the logic flaw. No authentication is required.
