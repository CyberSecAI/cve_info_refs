## 1.0 Whatâs New?

This release includes the following new features and enhancements:

* [Risk-based Multi-factor Authentication Support for OAuth Client Applications](#t4g0lnjbxva1)
* [Access Manager Migration from Windows to RHEL](#t4g0lph4fn75)
* [Identity Server Configuration to Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery Attacks](#t4g0lrrcure5)
* [HTTP/2 Protocol Support](#docker)
* [Enhanced WS Federation Service Provider](#t4fzejggia6z)
* [Analytics Dashboard Enhancements](#t4g4tinrrgz5)
* [Upgrade Service Changes](#t4g71a3yenb5)
* [Operating System Support](#os-updates)
* [Updates for Dependent Components](#library-updates)

### 1.1 Risk-based Multi-factor Authentication Support for OAuth Client Applications

This release adds risk-based multi-factor authentication support for OAuth client applications. Based on the contextual information of the client application, Access Manager computes the associated risk level and prompts for multi-factor authentication if required.

You can now configure authentication contracts for a client application. To enable risk-based authentication for an OAuth application, configure a risk-based contract for the application.

For more information, see [Managing OAuth Client Applications](https://www.microfocus.com/documentation/access-manager/5.0/admin/t46a7mqa8lti.html#oauth_client_reg) > Registering OAuth Client Applications in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

For information about configuring risk-based authentication, see [Configuring Risk-based Authentication](../admin/b1e08ogt.html#b1e08ogt) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

When you configure an authentication contract, the server-side configuration takes precedence. After this configuration, the ACR value in the request is ignored, and the configured contracts are used for authentication.

### 1.2 Access Manager Migration from Windows to RHEL

Access Manager 5.0 and later versions do not provide Windows-based installers. To leverage the latest features and functionalities available with version 5.0 Service Pack 1 or later, you can migrate Access Manager from Windows to RHEL.

For more information, see [Migrating Access Manager from Windows to RHEL](../install_upgrade/migrating-am-win-to-rhel.html#migrating-am-win-to-rhel) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Installation and Upgrade Guide](../install_upgrade/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

### 1.3 Identity Server Configuration to Prevent Cross-Site Request Forgery Attacks

This release introduces a new filter CSRFDetectionFilter to detect and mitigate any Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attempts in requests. You can configure this filter in web.xml of Identity Server.

For more information, see [Preventing Cross-Site Request Forgery Attacks](../security-guide/csrf.html#csrf) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Security Guide](../security-guide/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

### 1.4 HTTP/2 Protocol Support

Access Manager supports the HTTP/2 protocol.

The HTTP/2 protocol support helps in protecting the web application or web server which is HTTP/2 protocol enabled. This support also helps in communication with the HTTP/2 protocol using the HTTP/2 protocol - enabled browsers.

You can enable the following options:

* Browser and Access Gateway communication using the global and proxy level option named protocols h2.
* Access Gateway and web server communication using the proxy level option named ProxyHTTP2 on.

For more information, see [Configuring the HTTP/2 Protocol](../admin/http2-protocol-support.html#http2-protocol-support) and [Access Gateway Advanced Options](../admin/b3kjnio.html#b3kjnio) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

### 1.5 Enhanced WS Federation Service Provider

This release adds the following enhancements:

* Support for configuring authentication contracts for applications using WS-Federation. This feature allows configuring step-up authentication for applications that use WS-Federation protocol, such as SharePoint and Office365. For more information, see [Defining Options for WS Federation Service Provider Service Provider](../admin/wsfed-options.html#wsfed-options)and [Managing WS Federation Providers](../admin/wsfedproviders.html#wsfedproviders) > Contracts Assigned to a WS Federation Service Provider in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).
* Support for entityID in the WS-Federation schema. This support enables multiple federation configurations for the WS-Federation targets. For more information, see [WS Federation](../admin/wsfed.html#wsfed).
* Support for configuring virtual attributes in WS-Federation tokens.

### 1.6 Analytics Dashboard Enhancements

* *ElasticSearch Logstash Kibana (ELK) Version Upgrade:*
  The ELK version is upgraded from 7.4.2 to 7.10.2. This upgrades does not affect the behavior of Analytics Dashboard. The upgrade script handles the migration configuration. After the ELK upgrade, you can see significant performance improvement in handling number of events per sec. For more information, see [Upgrading Analytics Server](../install_upgrade/t45lrlcoi1lr.html#t45lrlcoi1lr) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).
* *Analytics Dashboard Cluster Upgrade:*
  The procedure of upgrading the Analytics Dashboard cluster is updated. For more information, see [Upgrade Analytics Server Cluster](../install_upgrade/t4g323bdomsa.html#t4g323bdomsa) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).

### 1.7 Upgrade Service Changes

You can now upgrade Access Manager through Upgrade Service. This upgrade supports both SLES and RHEL operating systems. For more information, see [Upgrading Access Manager through Upgrade Assistant](../install_upgrade/upgrade-assistant.html#t4j37h3dvrlq-upgrade-through-channel) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Installation and Upgrade Guide](../install_upgrade/bookinfo.html#bookinfo). In subsequent releases of Access Manager, Update Service will be enabled through Administration Console.

### 7.1 An Issue with Access Manager 5.0 Service Pack 1 Helm Rollback

*Workaround:*
No workaround is available.

### 7.2 Upgrading Kubernetes Cluster Server to a Later Version Disrupts the Installed Access Manager Setup

*Workaround:*
This Kubernetes upgrade approach is recommended when Access Manager is deployed.

Before Upgrade:

1. Scale down the Identity Server and Access Gateway pods to zero. A sample format is provided:

   * kubectl scale statefulset access-manager-am-idp --namespace automation --replicas=0
   * kubectl scale statefulset access-manager-am-ag --namespace automation --replicas=0

     This step prevents scheduling of Identity Server and Access Gateway nodes to other nodes during the Kubernetes upgrade.
2. Upgrade the Kubernetes cluster to the desired version.
3. Post Upgrade:

   Scale up the Identity Server and Access Gateway pods to the original count.
4. Log in to the Administration Console and check if the newly scheduled Identity Server and Access Gateway nodes are scheduled on the nodes on which they were scheduled before the upgrade. If not, then perform the following actions:

   * In the Identity Server cluster, remove the non-reporting Identity Server nodes and add the newly imported nodes.
   * In the Access Gateway cluster, add the newly imported Access Gateway nodes to the cluster and turn one of the new nodes as the primary member and delete all the non-reporting nodes.

*NOTE:*This is applicable to the manual Kubernetes upgrade process.

### 7.3 An Issue with the Advanced Authentication Integration Configuration After Migrating Access Manager from Windows to RHEL

After migration, the backup of config.xml does not contain endpoint details.

Workaround: Re-create the endpoints.

1. Click Devices > Identity Servers > Shared Settings > Advanced Authentication.
2. Delete the domain name or IP address of the Advanced Authentication server, specify a dummy IP address, and click Apply. For example, 10.10.10.11
3. Remove the /opt/novell/nam/idp/plugins/aa/config.xml file from all Identity Servers of the cluster.
4. Go to the Advanced Authentication administration portal and delete the endpoints.
5. At Access Manager, navigate to Devices > Identity Servers > Shared Settings > Advanced Authentication and specify the domain name or IP address of the Advanced Authentication server.
6. Click Apply.
7. Verify that the endpointâs ID and secret key are generated in the config.xml file.

   Verify that the endpoint has been created in the Advanced Authentication server. Go to the Advanced Authentication administration portal and verify that the hostname or domain name of the Identity Server cluster is displayed as the endpoint under Endpoints. If the cluster has only one Identity Server, the endpoint name is the DNS of Identity Serverâs base URL.

### 7.4 Analytics Dashboard Is Not Accessible After Upgrading from 4.5.3.1 to 5.0.1

Workaround: Perform the following steps:

*NOTE:*Before generating any certificates with Administration Console CA, ensure that the time is synchronized within one minute among all Access Manager devices. If the time of Administration Console is ahead of the device for which you are creating the certificate, the device rejects the certificate.

1. Click Security > Certificates > New.
2. Select Use local certificate authority.
3. Specify a name in Certificate name.
4. In Subject, click the Edit Subject icon.
5. In Common name, specify the DNS name of Administration Console.
6. Click OK.
7. Click Advanced Options.
8. In Alternative name(s), click the Edit Subject Alternate Name(s) icon > New.
9. Specify the following details:

   Name Type: IP address

   Name: IP address of Administration Console

   Name Type: DNS name

   Name: DNS of Administration Console
10. Click OK.
11. Click the newly added certificate > Add Certificate to Keystores.
12. Add the certificate to the Administration Console Keystore with alias as tomcat.
13. Restart Administration Console.
14. Restart the dashboard.

    lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    9 Aug  5 13:04 baseproduct -> SLES.prod
    ```

### 7.5 An Issue with SLES Registration and Updates After Installing or Upgrading Access Manager

Installing or upgrading to Access Manager 5.0 Service Pack 1 might hinder fetching updates from the SLES updates channel.

This issue might occur if /etc/products.d/baseproduct is symbolically linked to the /etc/products.d/am.prod file instead of the /etc/products.d/SLES.prod file. For example,

ll /etc/products.d/

total 8

-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2912 Nov 9 2019 SLES.prod

-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 818 Aug 4 16:39 am.prod

lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Aug 5 13:04 baseproduct -> /etc/products.d/am.prod

*Workaround:*
To avoid this issue, perform the following steps:

1. Register to the SLES updates channel before installing or upgrading Access Manager 5.0 Service Pack 1 and ensure that SLES updates are being fetched as expected.
2. Before installing and upgrading to Access Manager 5.0 Service Pack 1, ensure that the /etc/products.d/baseproduct file is symbolically linked to /etc/products.d/SLES.prod file. For example,

   ll /etc/products.d/

   total 8

   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2912 Nov 9 2019 SLES.prod

   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Aug 5 13:04 baseproduct -> SLES.prod
3. If a symbolic link is not present between /etc/products.d/baseproduct and SLES.prod, then run the following commands:

   cd /etc/products.d

   rm baseproduct command removes the symbolic link from baseproduct.

   ln âs SLES.prod baseproduct command creates a symbolic link between baseproduct and SLES.prod.
4. Install or upgrade to Access Manager 5.0.x.
5. Ensure that a symbolic link between /etc/products.d/baseproduct and SLES.prod exists post-install or upgrade. Run the following command to validate:

   ll /etc/products.d

   Example result:

   ll /etc/products.d/

   total 8

   -rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2912 Nov 9 2019 SLES.prod

   -rwxr-xr-x 1 root root 818 Aug 4 16:39 am.prod

   lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 9 Aug 5 13:04 baseproduct -> SLES.prod

To use Upgrade Assistant:

Change the /etc/products.d/baseproduct symbolic link from SLES.prod file to /etc/products.d/am.prod:

Commands:

```
cd /etc/products.d/
```

Verify the baseproduct symbolic link before changing it using the following command:

```
ll
```

Remove the symbolic link from baseproduct using the following command:

```
rm baseproduct
```
```
ln -s /etc/products.d/am.prod baseproduct
```

Verify the baseproduct symbolic link is now pointing to the am.prod file.

```
ll
```

Example output:

```
ll
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2912 Nov  9  2019 SLES.prod
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  818 Aug  4 16:39 am.prod
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root   23 Aug  5 14:24 baseproduct -> /etc/products.d/am.prod
```

NOTE:

* If you are already registered then change the symbolic link to am.prod file and enable the AM-5.0-Product repository (if present) using the following command:

  ```
  zypper mr -e AM-5.0-Product
  ```
* If you are changing the symbolic link back to SLES.prod, you must disable the AM-5.0-Product repository using the following command:

  ```
  zypper mr -d AM-5.0-Product
  ```

Now, you can register or deregister the update service, or check for available updates on the Upgrade Assistant page.

*NOTE:*If the symbolic link of baseproduct -> /etc/products.d/am.prod exists, there will be issues in fetching updates from the SLES updates channel. Hence, it is recommended to keep this configuration only for the duration until the user operations are done on the Upgrade Assistant page. When operations are complete on the Upgrade Assistant page, change the baseproduct symbolic link to SLES.prod.

To change the baseproduct symbolic link to SLES.prod, use the following commands:

```
cd /etc/products.d/
```

Verify the baseproduct symbolic link before changing it using the following command:

```
ll
```

Remove the symbolic link from baseproduct using the following command:

```
rm baseproduct
```
```
ln -s SLES.prod baseproduct
```

Verify the baseproduct symbolic link is now pointing to the SLES.prod file.

```
ll
```

Example output:

```
ll
total 8
-rw-r--r-- 1 root root 2912 Nov  9  2019 SLES.prod
-rwxr-xr-x 1 root root  818 Aug  4 16:39 am.prod
lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root    9 Aug  5 14:36 baseproduct -> SLES.prod
```

*NOTE:*

* The operating system prod file name might vary depending on the operating system. For example, SLES.prod file.
* This issue mostly occurs during the upgrade from Access Manager 5.0 to 5.0 Service Pack 1. However, it is recommended to verify the /etc/products.d/baseproduct symbolic link before performing a fresh installation or upgrading from Access Manager 4.5.X to 5.0 Service Pack 1.

### 7.6 Upgrading the Secondary Administration Console from 4.5 Service Pack 4 to 5.0 Service Pack 1 Fails

Workaround: Perform the following steps:

1. Connect to the primary and secondary Administration Console through SSH and verify the SSL EC certificate of secondary Administration Console by using the following command:

   ndsbackup s | grep "SSL EC"
2. Run the ndsconfig upgrade command first on the primary and then on the secondary Administration Console.

   Specify the admin name with context, password, and confirm if you want to configure Enhanced Background Authentication.
3. Run ndsbackup s | grep "SSL EC" again on both primary and secondary Administration Consoles to verify the EC certificate creation.
4. Upgrade from 4.5 Service Pack 4 to 5.0 Service Pack 1.

### 7.7 Administration Console Might Become Slow After Upgrading to 5.0 Service Pack 1

Workaround: Perform the following steps if you face any slowness:

1. Open the /etc/opt/novell/tomcat9/server.xml file using Advanced File Configurator.

   For information about how to open and edit a file using Advanced File Configurator, see [Modifying Configurations](../admin/mod-config-file.html#mod-config-file) in the [NetIQ Access Manager 5.0 Administration Guide](../admin/bookinfo.html#bookinfo).
2. Increase acceptorThreadCount to 2 for the Administration Console connector:

   ```
   <Connector port="8443" protocol="HTTP/1.1" SSLEnabled="true" maxThreads="150" maxHttpHeaderSize="8192" minSpareThreads="25" enableLookups="false" disableUploadTimeout="true" acceptorThreadCount="2" acceptCount="100" scheme="https" secure="true" keystoreType="PKCS12" keystoreFile="/var/opt/novell/novlwww/.p12" keystorePass="changeit" clientAuth="false" sslProtocol="TLS" sslEnabledProtocols="+TLSv1.1, +TLSv1.2"/>
   ```
3. Save the file.
