# Guest Users can create issues for Sentry errors and track their status

**[HackerOne report #1117768](https://hackerone.com/reports/1117768)** by `maruthi12` on 2021-03-05, assigned to GitLab Team:

[Report](#report) | [How To Reproduce](#how-to-reproduce)

## Report

##### Summary

According to the [permission docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/user/permissions.html) and [Error Tracking Docs](https://docs.gitlab.com/ee/operations/error_tracking.html#error-tracking-list) , only User with role `Reporter` or more can see or modify the Error Tracking details. However, the "Create Issue" allows a particular `Guest` user to create a reference issue for the error and track its status whenever some other user resolves it.

##### Steps to reproduce

(Step-by-step guide to reproduce the issue, including:)

1. Consider a private project with `Guest` role user.
2. Connect `Sentry` to this project from the `Maintainer` account.
3. And create new issues in Sentry. This automatically populates these errors in <https://gitlab.com/project_name/-/error_tracking/>.
4. Now, consider the request for creating an issue.

   POST Data format for this is as follows:

   ```
   issue[title]=Title
   issue[description]= Description
   issue[sentry_issue_attributes][sentry_issue_identifier]=Error_Id
   authenticity_token= your_auth_token
   ```
5. Change `Error_Id` parameter to some Error's reference id value (this is basically Sentry's Error id).
6. Now, execute the request from `Guest`'s session. This creates an issue for that particular error.
7. Now, go to the `Maintainer`'s login and resolve the error. This will close the issue that created by the `Guest User` with the message `[@]Maintainer resolved the corresponding error and closed the issue`.

#### Impact

Using this vulnerability, Guest Users can create issues for Sentry errors and track their Status.
