Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-22256

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control in GitLab's error tracking feature, specifically regarding the ability for Guest users to create issues linked to Sentry errors. While the documentation states that only users with "Reporter" or higher roles should be able to interact with error tracking details, the "Create Issue" functionality allows Guest users to bypass these permissions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Inadequate Access Control:** Guest users were able to create issues linked to Sentry errors, despite not having the appropriate permissions to modify or even view most error tracking details.
- **Bypass of Intended Permissions:** The "Create Issue" feature allowed Guest users to interact with error tracking in a way that the intended access control system should have prevented.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Issue Creation:** Guest users can create issues based on Sentry errors.
- **Error Tracking Status Monitoring:** Guest users can track the status of issues they created related to Sentry errors, even when these issues are resolved by users with higher permissions. This allows guest users to infer actions taken by maintainers/higher role users

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct HTTP Request Manipulation:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability by crafting and sending a specific POST request to the GitLab server, using the `issue` parameters, specifying the title, description, and `sentry_issue_identifier`. The request needs to be authenticated as a `Guest` user.
- **Sentry Error Identifier Requirement**: An attacker needs to have the Sentry error identifier, which is populated in the GitLab error tracking list when sent to Sentry by a user with higher permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **GitLab Guest User Account:** The attacker needs to have a `Guest` user account on the GitLab project.
- **Knowledge of Sentry Error ID:** The attacker needs access to a Sentry error ID that exists in the GitLab project's error tracking list.
- **Ability to craft HTTP requests:** The attacker has to be able to craft and send POST requests to the GitLab server.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided HackerOne report highlights a specific scenario where a Guest user can create an issue for a Sentry error and track its status, demonstrating the bypass of the permission model.
- The report includes a detailed step-by-step guide on how to reproduce the vulnerability.

This vulnerability allows a Guest user to indirectly interact with Sentry error tracking data, which they normally shouldn't have access to. The Guest user can use this to infer status changes from other, higher permission users.
