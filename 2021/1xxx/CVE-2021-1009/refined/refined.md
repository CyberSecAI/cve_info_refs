{
  "CVE-2021-1009": {
    "description": "In the normal cases, the package name and the calling uid should be from the same application. Adding this checking to get/setMimeGroup, and moving the implementation to the internal variants. Also, guard PackageSetting with the synchronized.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the improper enforcement of owner rights when accessing or modifying MIME groups. The system was not properly verifying if the package name and calling UID belonged to the same application when accessing get/setMimeGroup functions. This lack of verification allowed for potential information disclosure.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to MIME group data by bypassing the intended ownership checks.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited by making unauthorized calls to get/setMimeGroup functions with a different package name and UID.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker would need to have the ability to execute code or make calls to these functions in a way that bypasses the intended application context."
