**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect processing of certain Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) packets at ingress time.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Incorrect processing of LLDP packets leading to a memory leak.
- The vulnerability is located in the LLDP implementation of Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker can cause a memory leak on the affected device.
- The memory leak leads to continuous memory consumption, which can result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- The device may crash and reload due to memory exhaustion.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
