    "additonal_details": "The vulnerability affects Cisco Nexus 3000 and 9000 series switches running NX-OS software with NGOAM feature enabled and configured with a vPC peer. The NGOAM feature is disabled by default. The vulnerability may cause unexpected Cisco Fabric Services (CFS) protocol synchronizations between vPC peers. There are no workarounds, but disabling NGOAM mitigates the issue. The provided content includes details for determining if the NGOAM and vPC features are enabled, and instructions on applying SMU fixes."
