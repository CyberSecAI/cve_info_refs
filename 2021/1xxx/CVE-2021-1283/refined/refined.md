Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-1283

**Vulnerability Description:**
A vulnerability exists in the logging subsystem of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM). This vulnerability allows an authenticated, local attacker to view sensitive information within a restricted system log file. The root cause is that sensitive information is not properly masked before being written to the system log files.

**Root Cause:**
Improper masking of sensitive information before it is written to system log files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Information Disclosure, specifically, exposure of sensitive data through system logs. The vulnerability is classified as CWE-789, which refers to "Memory allocation with excessive size". However, the description provided seems more fitting to an information disclosure vulnerability due to inadequate data sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to view sensitive information present in the system log files. This could potentially include passwords, API keys, or other confidential data, depending on what's being logged.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access to the affected system
- Access to the system logs
- Authentication to the system with valid user credentials

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the system where DCNM is running
- The attacker must have valid user credentials to authenticate to the affected DCNM system.

**Affected Products:**
Cisco DCNM releases earlier than Release 11.5(1)

**Fixed Software:**
Cisco DCNM releases 11.5(1) and later contain the fix for this vulnerability.

**Workarounds:**
No workarounds are available to mitigate this vulnerability besides upgrading to a fixed software version
