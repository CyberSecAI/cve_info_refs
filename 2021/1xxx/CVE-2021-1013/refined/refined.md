Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1013:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from improper enforcement of permissions and owner rights in the `checkExistsAndEnforceCanNotModifyImmutablyRestrictedPermission()` method. Specifically, the check for these rights was occurring too late in the method's execution, potentially allowing unauthorized modifications.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Improper Permission Enforcement:** The core issue was that permission and owner right checks were not performed early enough in the method. This allowed a window where an operation could proceed without proper authorization, leading to a potential bypass of restrictions.
- **Inadequate Validation Timing:** The delayed timing of the validation made the system vulnerable. Moving the checks earlier in the method's execution was needed to ensure that the checks occur prior to operations that modify restricted permissions.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Elevation of Privilege (EoP):** Although the severity is marked as "Moderate" in the security bulletin, the vulnerability allows for a potential privilege elevation, because improper permission enforcement can allow unauthorized modifications to system settings or data. This could enable an attacker to gain access to functions or resources that should be protected.
- **Information Disclosure (ID):** Based on the security bulletin categorization for this specific vulnerability ID, there is a risk of information disclosure.

**Attack vectors:**

An attacker would need to target the `checkExistsAndEnforceCanNotModifyImmutablyRestrictedPermission()` method. The attacker's access to this method depends on the specific component where this method is located. Based on the commit message, this is likely related to Package Manager service, so the attacker would likely need to utilize functionalities exposed via this service.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker would likely need to be in a position to invoke methods within the Package Manager service.
- The attacker would need to have some level of access to the device, allowing the execution of privileged operations via the package manager.
- The attacker would need to be able to trigger the vulnerable code path within `checkExistsAndEnforceCanNotModifyImmutablyRestrictedPermission()` before the permission and owner checks are executed.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves moving the permission and owner right checks to the beginning of the method to ensure validation occurs before any operations that modify restricted permissions.
- Test cases and a PoC were created to verify the fix.
- The vulnerability was discovered by internal testing.
- The specific component impacted is within the framework's base, which likely involves core system permissions and settings.
