Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1095:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver's kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`).
- Specifically, it affects the handlers for control calls that contain embedded parameters.
- The issue occurs when an untrusted pointer is dereferenced within these handlers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Untrusted Pointer Dereference:** The core weakness is the driver's failure to properly validate a pointer before dereferencing it. This allows a malicious actor to potentially supply a pointer to an arbitrary memory location, leading to unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of successfully exploiting this vulnerability is a denial-of-service condition. This could involve crashing the driver or the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attack vector is local.
- **Control Calls with Embedded Parameters:** The vulnerability is triggered via specific control calls to the driver which carry embedded parameters that include the malicious pointer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:**  A local user with the ability to interact with the vulnerable driver is needed to trigger the vulnerability, which means an attacker requires local access to the target system and must have a way to make the specific control calls that trigger the vulnerability.
- **Unprivileged User:** The vulnerability can be triggered by a user with low privileges.

**Summary of Findings:**

The provided documents collectively confirm that CVE-2021-1095 is a vulnerability in NVIDIA GPU display drivers, impacting both Windows and Linux systems.  The vulnerability exists due to a lack of validation of pointers used in control calls with embedded parameters in the kernel mode layer. This lack of validation enables an attacker to cause a denial of service by dereferencing an arbitrary pointer.
