Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-1088:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the internal microcontroller of NVIDIA GPUs and Tegra hardware.
- It stems from insufficient access control for debug mechanisms.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient access control for debug mechanisms within the internal microcontroller.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Information disclosure. An attacker with elevated privileges can access sensitive information by exploiting the debug mechanisms.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required (AV:L).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have OS administrative/kernel level privileges (PR:H).
- High attack complexity is required (AC:H)
- The vulnerability is not dependent on user interaction (UI:N).
- The scope of the vulnerability is Unchanged (S:U).

**Affected products:**
- The following NVIDIA product lines are affected:
    - Turing, Volta, Pascal, Maxwell architecture GPUs
    - Tegra X1, Tegra X1+, Tegra TX2, and Xavier SOCs

**Additional details:**
- This vulnerability is present in both Windows and Linux operating systems.
- The document also mentions that Ampere products are not impacted, and virtualized GPU environments (vGPU) are not impacted directly.
- If the hypervisor is compromised or there is direct GPU access with bare metal or pass through, Turing, Volta, Pascal or Maxwell products can be exposed.
