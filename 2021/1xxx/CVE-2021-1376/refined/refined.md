    "summary": "A vulnerability in the fast reload feature of Cisco IOS XE Software running on Cisco Catalyst 3650, Cisco Catalyst 3850, Cisco Catalyst 9300, and Cisco Catalyst 9300L Series Switches could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system of an affected device.",
    "details": "This vulnerability is due to an improper check on the area of code that manages the verification of boot configuration files during the initial fast reload boot process. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker would need privileged access to the CLI of the device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system.",
