"text": "The vulnerabilities are not dependent on one another. Exploitation of one of the vulnerabilities is not required to exploit another vulnerability. In addition, a software release that is affected by one of the vulnerabilities may not be affected by the other vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nSeveral of the vulnerabilities below only impact Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software that is operating in a cluster. Customers can verify whether the software is operating in cluster mode by checking the Cisco SD-WAN vManage web-based management interface Administration > Cluster Management view. Customers should also refer to the Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide chapter on Cluster Management [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/manage-cluster.html\"].\r\n\r\nDetails about the vulnerabilities are as follows:\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1468: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Cluster Mode Unauthorized Message Processing Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in a messaging service of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software when operating in cluster mode could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to send unauthorized messages to the vulnerable application.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to improper authentication checks on user-supplied input to an application messaging service. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by submitting crafted input to the service. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to call privileged actions within the affected system, including creating new administrative level user accounts.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvu28454 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu28454\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1468\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.8\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1505: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Cluster Mode Privilege Escalation Vulnerability\r\n\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software when operating in cluster mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization checking and gain elevated privileges within an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform authorization checks on certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authorization checks and gain elevated privileges within the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvu28390 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu28390\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1505\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): Critical\r\nCVSS Base Score: 9.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1508: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Cluster Mode Unauthorized Access Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software when operating in cluster mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to bypass authorization checking and make application modifications that could allow the attacker to gain elevated privileges within an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform authorization checks on certain operations. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted requests to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass authorization checks and gain elevated privileges within the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvu28360 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu28360\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1508\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 8.1\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1275: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Denial of Service Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in an API of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a DoS condition on an affected system.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to insufficient handling of API requests to the affected system. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a large amount of API requests to the affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition on the affected system.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nBug ID(s): CSCvv67264 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv67264\"]\r\nCVE ID: CVE-2021-1275\r\nSecurity Impact Rating (SIR): High\r\nCVSS Base Score: 7.5\r\nCVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H\r\n\r\nCVE-2021-1506: Cisco SD-WAN vManage Cluster Mode Unauthorized Services Access Vulnerability\r\nA vulnerability in a service of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software when operating in cluster mode could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to services within an affected system.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability exists because the affected software does not perform authorization checks on service access.

## Information About Cluster Management

A Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster consists of at least three Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers. These servers manage the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN edge devices in a network. Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers in a cluster perform specific functions based on the services that are running on them. In this way, a cluster distributes
the workload among Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers while sharing information between these servers. For scaling recommendations, see *Server Recommendations* for your release in [​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller Compatibility Matrix and Server Recommendations](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/release/notes/compatibility-and-server-recommendations/comp-matrix-intro-chapter-map.html).

Use the Administration > Cluster Management window to create a Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster and perform related tasks.

From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, each Cisco SD-WAN Manager server has a *persona*. The persona is determined when the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server first boots up after Cisco SD-WAN Manager is installed and defines which services run on the server. The persona of a server lasts for the lifetime of the server and
cannot be changed. A server must have a persona before it can be added to a cluster. For more information on personas, see
[​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Persona and Storage Device](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/cisco-sd-wan-overlay-network-bringup.html#Cisco_Concept.dita_94e35b2a-3e6a-4f84-be57-e7aabf3f3421).

The role that a server has in a cluster depends on its persona. A Cisco SD-WAN Manager server can have any of the following personas:

* Compute+Data: Includes all services that are required for Cisco SD-WAN Manager, including services that are used for the application, statistics, configuration, messaging, and coordination
* Compute: Includes services that are used for the application, configuration, messaging, and coordination
* Data: Includes services that are used for the application and statistics

### Encryption

From Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.14.1a, cluster traffic for all services is encrypted.

### Reserved IP Addresses

From Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.14.1a, a WAN edge device or Cisco SD-WAN Control Components in a Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster reserve IP addresses with the 172.30.0.0/16 prefix. These reserved IP addresses cannot be used as a system IP address
by a WAN edge device or Cisco SD-WAN Control Components. If the reserved IP address is already in use by a WAN edge device or Cisco SD-WAN Control Components, open a TAC case to replace the IP addresses.

## Guidelines for a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Cluster

The following guidelines apply to a Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster:

* We recommend that all members of a Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster be located in the same data center.
* We recommend that the IP addresses of all members of the Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster be in the same subnet.
* We recommend that Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster interface should not be the same as transport interface. Beginning with Cisco vManage Release 20.9.1, this is enforced. If you attempt to configure this, Cisco SD-WAN Manager displays an error message.
* The cluster interface should not be accessible externally.
* Access to Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster IP addresses is restricted to Cisco SD-WAN Manager instances in the same cluster.
* The members of a Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster rely on timestamps to synchronize data and to track device uptime. For this time-dependent data to remain accurate,
  if you need to change the clock time of a Cisco SD-WAN Manager server in a cluster, make the same change on every Cisco SD-WAN Manager server in the cluster.
* In a three node cluster deployment, only one node can have a systematic failure. When one node fails, the Cisco SD-WAN Manager Graphical User Interface (GUI) of two remaining nodes are reachable and can communicate with remaining nodes through SSH.
  If two nodes fail, the GUI of an active node on which a user is already logged in allows read-only operations, but new logins
  to the GUI are not permitted.
* When the guest node has factory default credentials configured on it and a host node tries to add it to the cluster, the cluster
  management fails. You must modify the password on new node same as that of the other nodes in the cluster.
* When logged in using a single sign-on (SSO) user with netadmin privilege, user cannot perform any of the cluster or disaster
  recovery operations using the SSO user. For any cluster operations like add, delete node, or enable SD-AVC, Cisco SD-WAN Manager expects any local username and password part of the net-admin group. In case of multitenancy, only admin user can update
  the SD-AVC. Other users even with netadmin privileges cannot update SD-AVC.
* On devices without dedicated mgmt-intf, VPN 512 gets mapped to custom VRF 512, instead of VRF mgmt-intf. In the back end,
  this VRF is not mapped to same namespace as other platforms. You cannot download the image as there is a platform difference.

## View Available Cluster Services

To view the services that are available in and reachable on all the members in a Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster, choose Administration > Cluster Management > Service Reachability.

## Configure the Cluster IP Address of a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Server

When you start Cisco SD-WAN Manager for the first time, the default IP address of the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server is shown as localhost. Before you can add a new Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to a cluster, you must change the localhost address of the primary Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to an out-of-band IP address. (From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, the primary Cisco SD-WAN Manager server has the Compute+Data persona.) Servers in the cluster use this out-of-band IP address to communicate with each other.

If you need to change the out-of-band IP address in the future, contact your Cisco support representative.

Cluster interconnection between Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers requires that each of the servers be assigned a static IP address. We recommend that you do not use DHCP to assign
IP addresses to Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers that are to be a part of a cluster. Configure the IP address on a nontunnel interface in VPN 0.

Before you configure the cluster IP address of a Cisco SD-WAN Manager server, ensure that out-of-band IP addresses have been configured on VPN0 for its server interfaces. This configuration typically
is done when the server is provisioned. The port type for an out-of-band IP address must be **service** for the IP address to be available for assigning to a Cisco SD-WAN Manager server.

| **Note** | ---  From Cisco vManage Release 20.11.1, some alarms display the hostname as localhost during the cluster setup for the first time as the system-ip/hostname is not configured in Cisco SD-WAN Manager. When the system-ip/hostname is configured, the alarms display the correct hostname.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Configure the IP Address for Releases Before Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1

Configure the IP address of a Cisco SD-WAN Manager server before you add the server to the cluster. To do so for releases before Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, follow these steps:

1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
2. Click Add vManage.

   The Edit vManage dialog box opens.
3. From the vManage IP Address drop-down list, choose an IP address to assign to the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server.
4. Enter the user name and password for logging in to the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server.
5. Click Update.

The Cisco SD-WAN Manager server reboots and displays the Cluster Management window.

### Configure the IP Address for Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 and Later Releases

Configure the IP address of a Cisco SD-WAN Manager server before you add the server to the cluster. To do so from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, perform the following steps.

Perform this procedure on the primary Cisco SD-WAN Manager server (which has the Compute+Data persona).

1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management.

   The Cluster Management window is displayed. The table on this window lists the Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers that are in the cluster.
2. Click ... adjacent to the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to configure and click Edit.

   The Edit vManage dialog box is displayed.
3. In the Edit vManage dialog box, perform the following actions.

   | **Note** | ---  You cannot change the persona of a server. So the Node Persona options are disabled.  --- |
   | --- | --- |

   1. From the vManage IP Address drop-down list, choose an out-of-band static IP address to assign to the server.
   2. In the Username field, enter the user name for logging in to the server.
   3. In the Password field, enter the password for logging in to the server.
   4. (Optional) Click Enable SD-AVC if you want Cisco Software-Defined Application Visibility and Control (SD-AVC) to run on the server.

      Cisco SD-AVC is a component of Cisco Application Visibility and Control (AVC). It can be enabled on only one Cisco SD-WAN Manager server. The server on which it is enabled must have the Compute+Data or the Compute persona. Cisco SD-AVC cannot be enabled
      on a server that has the Data persona.

      | **Note** | ---   If Cisco SD-WAN Manager is set up as a cluster and the cluster crashes as a result of a reboot or upgrade, the connection to the edge device is reset and the custom app ceases to function.  To resolve this and to resume operation, redefine the custom application name with a new, unique name. For more information to define custom applications, see the [Define Custom Applications Using ​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/policies/ios-xe-17/policies-book-xe/m-custom-applications.html#define-custom-applications-using-vmanage) chapter of the *​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Policies Configuration Guide*.   --- |
      | --- | --- |
   5. Click Update.

      The server reboots and displays the Cluster Management window.

## Add a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Server to a Cluster

Table 2. Feature History

| Feature Name | Release Information | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco SD-WAN Manager Persona-based Cluster Configuration | Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.6.1a  Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.6.1  Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 | Simplifies adding Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers to a cluster by identifying servers based on personas. A persona defines what services run on a server. |

The following sections provide information about adding a Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to a cluster in various Cisco SD-WAN Manager releases.

### Add a Cisco SD-WAN Manager Server to a Cluster for Releases Before Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1

To add a new Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to a cluster for releases before Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, perform the following steps on the primary Cisco SD-WAN Manager server.

Before you begin, ensure that the default IP address of the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server has been changed to an out-of-band IP address as described in [Configure the Cluster IP Address of a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Server](#configure-cluster-IP-address-vmanage-server "Before you can add a new Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to a cluster, you must change the localhost address of the primary Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to an out-of-band IP address.").

1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
2. Click Add Manager.

   The Edit Manager window opens.
3. In the Manager IP Address field, select an IP address to assign to the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server.
4. Enter the username and password for logging in to the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server.
5. Enter the IP address of the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server that you are adding to the cluster.
6. Specify the username and password for the new Cisco SD-WAN Manager server.
7. Select the services to be run on the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server. You can select from the services listed below. Note that the Application Server field is not editable. The Cisco SD-WAN Manager Application Server is the local Cisco SD-WAN Manager HTTP web server.

   * Statistics Database: Stores statistics from all the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN devices in the network.
   * Configuration Database: Stores all the device and feature templates and configurations for all the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN devices in the network.
   * Messaging Server: Distributes messages and shares state among all the Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster members.
8. Click Add.

   The Cisco SD-WAN Manager server that you just added reboots before joining the cluster.

| **Note** | ---  * In a cluster, we recommend that you run at least three instances of each service. * When you add the first two compute or compute+data nodes to the cluster, the host node’s application-server is unavailable.   The following message is displayed on the host node’s GUI, before the application-server shuts down in the host node: `\Node added to the cluster. The operation may take up to 30 minutes and may cause application-server to restart in between.   Once the application server is back online, the post cluster operation progress can be viewed under tasks pop-up\`. * Starting Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.12.1a, ensure that you disable the HTTP/HTTPs Proxy option in the Cisco SD-WAN Manager settings, before adding a node to the cluster.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Add a Cisco SD-WAN Manager Server to a Cluster for Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 and Later Releases

From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, a cluster supports any of the following deployments of nodes:

* Three Compute+Data nodes
* Three Compute+Data nodes and three Data nodes

  | **Note** | ---   DATA nodes should be added only after 3 node cluster with CONFIG+DATA is added.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* Three Compute nodes and three Data nodes (supported only in an upgrade from an existing deployment)

If you require a different combination of nodes, contact your Cisco representative.

To add a Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to a cluster from Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, perform the following steps.

Perform this procedure on a Compute+Data node or a Compute node. Performing this procedure on a Data node is not supported
because a Data node does not run all the services that are required for the addition.

Do not add a server that was a member of the cluster and then removed from the cluster. If you need to add that server to
the cluster, bring up a new VM on that server to be used as the node to add.

Before you begin, ensure that the default IP address of the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server has been changed to an out-of-band IP address, as described in [Configure the Cluster IP Address of a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Server](#configure-cluster-IP-address-vmanage-server "Before you can add a new Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to a cluster, you must change the localhost address of the primary Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to an out-of-band IP address."). This operation must happen only once on the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server and then the same is used to add other servers to form a cluster.

1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management.

   The Cluster Management page window appears. The table on this window shows the Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers that are in the cluster.
2. Click Add Manager.

   The Add Manager dialog box opens.

   | **Note** | ---  If the Edit Manager dialog box opens, configure an out-of-band IP address for the server, as described in [Configure the Cluster IP Address of a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Server](#configure-cluster-IP-address-vmanage-server "Before you can add a new Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to a cluster, you must change the localhost address of the primary Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to an out-of-band IP address."), and then repeat this procedure for adding a server.  --- |
   | --- | --- |
3. In the Add Manager dialog box, perform the following actions:

   1. Click the Node Persona option (Compute+Data, Compute, or Data) that corresponds to the persona that has been configured for the server.

      You can determine the persona of a server by logging in to the server and looking at the persona display on the Administration > Cluster Management window. If you choose an incorrect persona, a message displays the persona that you should choose.
   2. From the Manager IP Address drop-down list, choose the IP address of the server to be added to the cluster.
   3. In the Username field, enter the user name for logging in to the server.
   4. In the Password field, enter the password for logging in to the server.
   5. (Optional) Click Enable SD-AVC if you want Cisco Software-Defined Application Visibility and Control (SD-AVC) to run on the server.

      Cisco SD-AVC is a component of Cisco Application Visibility and Control (AVC). It can be enabled on one Cisco SD-WAN Manager server. The server on which it is enabled must have the Compute+Data or the Compute persona. Cisco SD-AVC cannot be enabled
      on a server that has the Data persona.

      If you enabled Cisco SD-AVC for this server when you changed its IP address, the Enable SD-AVC check box is checked by default.
   6. Click Add.
   7. To confirm, click OK.

      The dialog box indicates that the services will restart, and that the existing metadata and other information that is not
      required when the server joins the cluster will be deleted from the server.

      When you click OK, the system starts the server add operation. The Cluster Management window displays the tasks that the system performs as it adds the server.

      As part of this operation, the system checks the compatibility of the server that you are adding. This check ensures that
      the server has sufficient disk space, and that the persona that you specified matches the persona of the node.

      After the server is added, the system performs a cluster sync operation, which rebalances the services in the cluster. Then
      the Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers in the cluster restart.

   0. For information about data stream troubleshooting tools, see [Data Stream Troubleshooting Tools FAQ](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/routers/sd-wan/214662-data-stream-troubleshooting-tools-faq.html).

## Edit Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Parameters

You can edit various parameters for a Cisco SD-WAN Manager server that has been added to a cluster. To do so, follow these steps:

1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
2. Click ... adjacent to the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server to edit, and click Edit.

   The Edit vManage window opens.
3. Select an IP address to edit.
4. Enter the username and password, and edit parameters for the selected Cisco SD-WAN Manager server.

   * For releases before Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you can edit the cluster services.
   * From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you can change the IP address to another IP address that appears in the vManage IP Address drop-down list, change the Cisco SD-AVC setting, or change the username and password if the server credentials have changed.
5. Click Update.

## Update Configuration Database Login

The default username of the configuration database is **neo4j** and the default password is **password**. To update the default login credentials of the configuration database, access Cisco SD-WAN Manager using a terminal and run the following commands. Do not use the SSH terminal option in Cisco SD-WAN Manager to run these commands. Doing so causes you to lose access to Cisco SD-WAN Manager.

1. Use request nms application-server stop  to stop application servers on all the Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers whether configuration-db is enabled or not.

   .
2. Use one of the following commands to reset the user name and password for the configuration database on all the Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers:

   * For Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.1 and earlier:

     request nms configuration-db
     update-admin-user username
     username
     password
     password
     newusername
     newadminuser
     newpassword
     newpassword
   * For releases from Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.2:

     request nms configuration-db update-admin-user

     When prompted, enter your current username and password, and your new username and password.

     When you run one of these commands, Cisco SD-WAN Manager restarts the application server

   | **Note** | ---  * If you do not know the default credentials of the configuration database, contact your Cisco support representative to retrieve   the credentials. * You cannot use a previous username. * Passwords can include only a mix of characters A to Z ( upper or lowercase), digits 0 to 9, and special characters @, #, and   \*.  --- |
   | --- | --- |

   Example

   * For Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.1 and earlier:

     `request nms configuration-db update-admin-user username neo4j password ******** newusername myusername newpassword mypassword`
   * For releases from Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.1.2:

     `request nms configuration-db update-admin-user`

     `Enter current user name: neo4j`

     `Enter current user password: password`

     `Enter new user name: myusername`

     `Enter new user password: mypassword`

| **Note** | ---  After a configuration database admin user update, if you are unable to view a specific Cisco SD-WAN Manager instance, use the request nms application-server restart  command to restart the application server on that Cisco SD-WAN Manager instance again.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Starting from Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.6.1, when using the request nms configuration-db update-admin-user  command to update the admin user credentials, provide the same inputs (old username, password and the new username, password) across all the nodes in the Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster. You must execute the request nms configuration-db update-admin-user  command one node at a time. We recommend that you do not push the CLI to all the nodes at the same time because the NMS services will restart for the new configuration to take effect.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Downgrade Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager

You cannot downgrade Cisco SD-WAN Manager (install a version of Cisco SD-WAN Manager that is lower than
the current version), either through Cisco SD-WAN Manager or by using CLI
commands.

| **Note** | ---  This restriction applies for single Cisco SD-WAN Manager instances and for Cisco SD-WAN Manager clusters. This restriction is not related to software upgrades or downgrades on network devices.  --- |
| --- | --- |

To downgrade your Cisco SD-WAN Manager
version, contact your Cisco support representative.

### Information About Cluster Upgrade

This section describes how to upgrade Cisco SD-WAN Manager in a cluster.

You can upgrade directly from Cisco vManage 20.3.1 or later releases to Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1. To upgrade from earlier releases, first upgrade to Cisco vManage 20.4.2 or Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1.

If you are upgrading a Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster deployment from Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 or later to Cisco vManage Release 20.5.1 or later, you must do it through the CLI.

If you are upgrading to Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 or later releases from a six-node Cisco SD-WAN Manager cluster deployment in which not all services are running on all nodes, contact your Cisco support representative before performing
the upgrade.

#### Checking Software Compatibility Before Upgrade

(Minimum supported release: Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Release 20.14.1)

In a cluster deployment, Cisco SD-WAN Manager services such as the configuration database, coordination service, and messaging services operate in a cluster mode.

We recommend using Cisco SD-WAN Manager to perform cluster upgrade, rather than CLI methods. Cisco SD-WAN Manager performs an important pre-upgrade check before
proceeding with an upgrade. The pre-upgrade check includes items such as certificate expiration dates, the configuration database,
CPU, disk, memory, and the status of services such as the coordination service and messaging service. If the cluster is not
ready for upgrade, Cisco SD-WAN Manager notifies you.

After an upgrade, Cisco SD-WAN Manager performs a post-upgrade check, which includes checking the functionality of services to ensure a successful upgrade. If an
upgrade fails, you can use Cisco SD-WAN Manager to troubleshoot and run the upgrade again.

While a cluster upgrade is in progress, at a given time, some nodes in the cluster continue to run an older software release
while others have been upgraded to the newer release. Consequently, during the upgrade, there may be incompatibilities between
services of the older and newer releases, preventing them from functioning properly.

For information about how to upgrade Cisco SD-WAN Manager clusters using Cisco SD-WAN Manager, see the [​Software Upgrade](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/Monitor-And-Maintain/monitor-maintain-book/m-maintenance.html#c-Software_Upgrade-12330) section in the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Monitor and Maintain Configuration Guide.

#### Encryption

Minimum supported release: Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Release 20.14.1

For a multitenant cluster upgrade from Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Release 20.13.1 to Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Release 20.14.1 using Cisco SD-WAN Manager, the upgrade coordinator sometimes fails due to the encryption keys. The upgrade coordinator service uses the encryption
keys to encrypt the service credentials.

To re-encrypt the service credentials, reboot the Cisco SD-WAN Manager and trigger the software activation.

### Prerequisites for Cluster Upgrade

Before you upgrade Cisco SD-WAN Manager nodes to Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 or later releases, verify the following:

* Ensure that the internal user account vmanage-admin is not locked for any server that you are upgrading.

  You can check the status of this admin account by pushing a template to the devices that are connected to the server. The
  push fails if the account is locked. In such a scenario, you can unlock the account by using the request aaa unlock-user vmanage-admin command.
* Ensure that PKI keys have been exchanged between the servers that you are upgrading.

  To do so, ensure that the control connections are in the UP state on the servers and restart the application server.
* Ensure that the out-of-band IP address of each server is reachable.
* Ensure that the Cisco SD-WAN Manager is accessible on all servers in the cluster.
* Ensure that DCA is running on all nodes in the cluster.

  To do so, use the **request nms data-collection-agent status** command and ensure that the status value shows running for each node.

  To start DCA, if needed, use the **request nms data-collection-agent start** command.
* (Minimum supported release: Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Release 20.13.1) Use the request nms application-server status command to verify that there is no schema violation in the configuration database. If the command output indicates a violation,
  contact Cisco Customer Support to resolve the issue.

If these prerequisites are not met or if another error occurs during the upgrade the activation of the image fails and a file
named upgrade-context.json is created in the /opt/data/extra-packages/*image-version* folder on each node in the cluster. You can provide this file to your Cisco representative for assistance with resolving
the issue.

### Upgrade a Cluster Using CLI

1. Take snapshots of all the Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers. Take a backup of the configuration database and save it in a location outside of the Cisco SD-WAN Manager server using the following command:

   request nms configuration-db backup path
   path\_and\_filename
2. Ensure that Cisco vManage Release 18.3 or later is installed.
3. For upgrades from Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 or later, copy the current image to each Cisco SD-WAN Manager server in the cluster and install the image on each Cisco SD-WAN Manager server by using the following command. Do not activate the image at this time.

   request software install
   path

   | **Note** | ---   The copy to Cisco SD-WAN Manager can be done using SCP using CLI using the VPN 512 interface.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
4. For upgrades from Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 or later, activate the current image on each Cisco SD-WAN Manager server using the following command. All servers reboot simultaneously.

   request software activate
   version
5. You must upgrade the configuration database when upgrading from one of the following:

   * Cisco vManage Release 18.4.x or 19.2.x to Cisco vManage 20.3.x or 20.4.x
   * Cisco vManage Release 20.3.x or 20.4.x to Cisco vManage Release 20.5.x or 20.6.x
   * Any Cisco SD-WAN Manager release to Cisco vManage Release 20.10.1 or later

   | **Note** | ---  * Starting from Cisco vManage Release 20.1.1, before upgrading the configuration database, ensure that you verify the database   size. We recommend that the database size is less than or equal to 5 GB. To verify the database size, use the following diagnostic   command:  request nms   configuration-db diagnostics * When you upgrade the configuration database, ensure that you have activated the current image on each Cisco SD-WAN Manager server in the cluster as described in the previous step. In addition, ensure that all services except the application server   and configuration-db services are running on these servers by entering the **request nms all status** command on each server.  --- |
   | --- | --- |

   To upgrade the configuration database, do the following:

   1. To determine which node to upgrade, enter the request nms configuration-db status command on each node. In the output look for the following:

      ```
      Enabled: true
      Status: not running
      ```

      | **Note** | ---   After activating a new image on a Cisco SD-WAN Manager host server, the server reboots. After the reboot, for approximately 30 minutes, the output of the request nms configuration-db status command shows Enabled: false even on a node that has the configuration database enabled, while NMS services are being migrated to a containerized form.   --- |
      | --- | --- |
   2. On the node to upgrade, as determined in the previous step, enter the following:

      request nms configuration-db upgrade

      | **Note** | ---  * Enter this command on one node only. * Do not enter this command if you are upgrading from Cisco vManage Release 20.5.x to Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 or later.  --- |
      | --- | --- |
6. Enter your login credentials, if prompted. Login credentials are prompted in releases earlier than Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 if all the Cisco SD-WAN Manager servers establish control connection with each other. After a successful upgrade, all the configuration database services
   are UP across the cluster, and the application server is started.

You can check the database upgrade logs at the following location: *vmanage-server*:/var/log/nms/neo4j-upgrade.log.

## Manually Restart Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Processes

If the cluster is malfunctioning and requires restart, you can manually restart the Cisco SD-WAN Manager processes. Do one
of the following:

• (Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 and later) Use the request nms all restart command to restart all processes.

• (Releases earlier than Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1) Restart the processes one at a time in an orderly manner using the procedure that follows. The manual restart order may
vary for your cluster, depending on what services you are running on the Cisco SD-WAN Manager instances in the cluster. The
following order is based on a basic cluster with three Cisco SD-WAN Manager devices.

1. On each Cisco SD-WAN Manager device, stop all the NMS services:

   ```
   request nms all stop

   ```
2. Verify that all the services have stopped. It is normal for the request nms all stop command to display a message about failing to stop a service if it takes too long. So use the following command to verify
   that everything is stopped before proceeding further:

   ```
   request nms all status

   ```
3. Start the Statistics database on each device that is configured to run it. Wait for the service to start each time before
   proceeding to the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device.

   ```
   request nms statistics-db start

   ```
4. Verify that the service is started before proceeding to start it on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager. After the service starts, perform step 3 to start the Statistics database on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device. After all the Cisco SD-WAN Manager devices have the Statistics database running, proceed to the next step.

   ```
   request nms statistics-db status

   ```
5. Start the Configuration database on each device that is configured to run it. Wait for the service to start each time before
   proceeding to the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device.

   ```
   request nms configuration-db start

   ```
6. For releases earlier than Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1, verify that the service has started before proceeding to start it on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device. Go to vshell and tail a log file to look for a message that the database is online. After confirming, go to step
   5 to start the Configuration database on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device. After all the Cisco SD-WAN Manager devices have the Configuration database running, proceed to the next step.

   ```
   tail -f -n 100 /var/log/nms/vmanage-neo4j-out.log

   ```
7. Start the Coordination server on each device. Wait for the service to start each time before proceeding to the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device.

   ```
   request nms coordination-server start

   ```
8. Verify that the service is started before proceeding to start it on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device. After verifying, go to step 7 to start the Coordination server on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device. After the Coordination server runs on all the Cisco SD-WAN Manager devices, proceed to the next step.

   ```
   request nms coordination-server status

   ```
9. Start the Messaging server on each device. Wait for the service to start each time before proceeding to the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device.

   ```
   request nms messaging-server start

   ```
10. Verify that the service has started before proceeding to start the service on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device. After verifying, go to step 9 to start the Messaging server on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device. After the Messaging server runs on all the Cisco SD-WAN Manager devices, proceed to the next step.

    ```
    request nms messaging-server status

    ```
11. Start the Application server on each device. Wait for the service to start each time before proceeding to the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device.

    ```
    request nms application-server start

    ```
12. For Cisco vManage Release 20.3.1 and later releases, start the server-proxy service on each Cisco SD-WAN Manager device:

    ```
    request nms server-proxy start
    ```

    To verify that the service is fully started, open the GUI of that Cisco SD-WAN Manager device. After the GUI is fully loaded and you are able to log in, start the server-proxy service on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device.
13. Restart the NMS cloud services on each device. Wait for the services to start each time before proceeding to the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device.

    You can verify that the cloud services are running by entering the following commands:

    ```
    request nms cloud-agent status
    ```
    ```
    request nms cloud-agent-v2 status
    ```

    Verify that the service has started before proceeding to start it on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device. After verifying, start the cloud services on the next Cisco SD-WAN Manager device. After the cloud services run on all the Cisco SD-WAN Manager devices, continue to the next step.
14. To verify that there are no errors and everything has loaded cleanly, tail the log files.

If you experience issues when upgrading to Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1 or later, contact your Cisco support representative for assistance.

| **Note** | ---  Consider bringing up the services manually as described in this section whenever you have to reboot a Cisco SD-WAN Manager device, or after an upgrade.  --- |
| --- | --- |

Starting from Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.10.1a, a device-data-collector service container is added. The following is a sample output for the command, `request nms device-data-collector`.

```
Device# request nms device-data-collector
Possible completions:
  diagnostics   Run diagnostics on NMS component
  jcmd          Run jcmd on NMS component
  restart       Restart NMS component
  start         Start NMS component
  status        Status of NMS component
  stop          Stop NMS component

```

## Remove Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Nodes from a Cluster

You can remove a Cisco SD-WAN Manager node from a cluster, if necessary.

In releases earlier than Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you can only remove *n* - 2 Cisco SD-WAN Manager nodes from a cluster of *n* nodes. You must retain at least two Cisco SD-WAN Manager nodes in a cluster.

From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, you must retain at least two Cisco SD-WAN Manager nodes that include the compute capability and at least one node that includes the data capability. That is, the cluster must
retain any of the following:

* At least two Cisco SD-WAN Manager nodes that include the Compute+Data persona
* At least one Cisco SD-WAN Manager nodes that includes the Compute+Data persona and one Cisco SD-WAN Manager node that includes the Compute persona
* At least two Cisco SD-WAN Manager nodes that include the Compute persona and one Cisco SD-WAN Manager node that includes the Data persona

From Cisco vManage Release 20.6.1, if a Cisco SD-WAN Manager node is reachable when you remove it from a cluster, Cisco SD-WAN Manager automatically performs a factory reset operation on the removed node to ensure that the node does not join the cluster again.
If a Cisco SD-WAN Manager node is unreachable when you remove it from a cluster, a factory reset operation is not performed on the node. In this situation,
the node is added back to the cluster automatically when the node becomes reachable. To prevent the node from being added
back to the cluster, enter the command **request software reset** from the CLI of the node after the node is removed from the cluster.

To remove a Cisco SD-WAN Manager node from a cluster, follow these steps:

1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager, choose Administration > Cluster Management and click Service Configuration.
2. Click … adjacent to the Cisco SD-WAN Manager instance that you want to remove and click **Remove**.

   The Remove Manager dialog box opens.
3. Enter the username and password to confirm the removal of the device from the network.
4. Click **Remove**.

The Cisco SD-WAN Manager instance is removed from the cluster, the certificates for that Cisco SD-WAN Manager are deleted, and Cisco SD-WAN Manager undergoes a factory reset.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco SD-WAN vManage Software Authentication Bypass Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2  First Published: 2021 May 5 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvi69876](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvi69876)     CVE-2021-1284     CWE-284       CVSS Score: [Base 8.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2021-1284     CWE-284       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2/csaf/cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the web-based messaging service interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to bypass authentication and authorization and modify the configuration of an affected system. To exploit this vulnerability, the attacker must be able to access an associated Cisco SD-WAN vEdge device.  This vulnerability is due to insufficient authorization checks. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the web-based messaging service interface of an affected system. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain unauthenticated *read* and *write* access to the affected vManage system. With this access, the attacker could access information about the affected vManage system, modify the configuration of the system, or make configuration changes to devices that are managed by the system.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following products:    + IOS XE SD-WAN Software   + SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator Software   + SD-WAN vEdge Cloud Routers   + SD-WAN vEdge Routers   + SD-WAN vSmart Controller Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases Customers are advised to upgrade to an appropriate fixed software release as indicated in the following table(s). To ensure a complete upgrade solution, consider that this advisory is part of a collection that includes the following advisories:    + [cisco-sa-sd-wan-vmanage-4TbynnhZ](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sd-wan-vmanage-4TbynnhZ): Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Vulnerabilities   + [cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdw-auth-bypass-65aYqcS2): Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Authentication Bypass Vulnerability   + [cisco-sa-sdwan-dos-Ckn5cVqW](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-dos-Ckn5cVqW): Cisco SD-WAN Software vDaemon Denial of Service Vulnerability   + [cisco-sa-sdwan-buffover-MWGucjtO](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-buffover-MWGucjtO): Cisco SD-WAN vEdge Software Buffer Overflow Vulnerabilities      | Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software Release | First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability | First Fixed Release for All Vulnerabilities Described in the Collection of Advisories |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 18.4 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 18.4 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 19.2 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 19.3 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.1 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.3 | 20.3.1 | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 20.4 | 20.4.1 | 20.4.1 |   | 20.5 | 20.5.1 | 20.5.1 |  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 9.8 |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.
