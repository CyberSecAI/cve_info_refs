Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-1127

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Improper input validation of log file content stored on the affected device. Specifically, the web-based management interface of Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) does not properly validate log file content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious code into log files. This code is then executed when a user views the modified log file through the web interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary script code: An attacker can execute arbitrary script code within the context of the user's browser session when they view the modified log file in the web interface.
- Access to sensitive, browser-based information: The attacker could gain access to sensitive information stored or accessible through the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- Authenticated Access: The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the web-based management interface.
- Log File Modification: The attacker exploits this vulnerability by modifying a log file with malicious code.
- User Interaction: The attacker needs to entice a user to view the modified log file through the web-based interface for the exploit to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated: The attacker must have valid credentials to access the web-based management interface.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the affected device.
- Ability to Modify Log Files: The attacker must be able to modify log files stored on the affected device.

**Additional Information:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco Enterprise NFVIS devices running releases earlier than Release 4.4.1.
- **Fixed Software:** Cisco Enterprise NFVIS releases 4.4.1 and later contain the fix for this vulnerability.
- **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
- **Exploitation:** The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
- **Discovery:** This vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- **CVSS Score:** The base CVSS v3.1 score is 5.4 (Medium Severity) with the vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N.
- **CWE:** CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))
