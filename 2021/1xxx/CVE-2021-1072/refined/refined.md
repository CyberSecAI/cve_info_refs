- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper handling of log files within the GameStream component (`rxdiag.dll`) of NVIDIA GeForce Experience software. This improper handling leads to arbitrary file deletion.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Arbitrary file deletion vulnerability due to how log files are managed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is needed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs low privileges, user interaction, and high attack complexity to exploit the vulnerability.
