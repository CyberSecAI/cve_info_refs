Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1162:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious data.
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution as the root user on the device's operating system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can also cause the device to restart unexpectedly, leading to a DoS condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute commands on the underlying operating system with root privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:** The device can become unavailable due to unexpected reloads.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker full control over the device, leading to potential compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via crafted HTTP requests sent to the affected device's web-based management interface.
*   **WAN Access:** If the remote management feature is enabled, the web interface is accessible through the WAN.
*   **LAN Access:** The web interface is always accessible through a local LAN connection.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrator Credentials:** To exploit the web interface vulnerabilities, the attacker needs valid administrator credentials on the affected device.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the device, either through the LAN or, if remote management is enabled, through the WAN.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory states that there are no workarounds available for these vulnerabilities.
*   Cisco will not release software updates to address the vulnerability as the affected devices have entered the end-of-life process.
*   Cisco advises customers to migrate to Cisco Small Business RV132W, RV160, or RV160W Routers.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as High severity with a CVSS base score of 7.2
*   The vulnerability is tracked by Cisco bug ID CSCvv96733
