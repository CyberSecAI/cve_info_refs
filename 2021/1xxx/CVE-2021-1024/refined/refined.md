Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1024:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the PackageInstaller's receivers being exported, allowing other apps to launch them and execute functionality within the PackageInstaller.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The core weakness is the unnecessary export of PackageInstaller's declared receivers. These receivers, intended for system broadcasts, should not be exposed to external applications.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation allows malicious apps to launch the PackageInstaller's receivers, potentially leading to unauthorized execution of PackageInstaller functionalities. This could range from unexpected application behavior to more severe actions depending on what the receivers can trigger.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves malicious apps sending intents to launch the exported receivers of the PackageInstaller.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device. The application does not need special permissions other than the ability to send intents.

**Additional details:**
- The provided information gives details on the code change resolving the issue.
- The fix involves preventing these receivers from being exported to other apps.
- The vulnerability is described as a moderate severity elevation of privilege (EoP) issue.
