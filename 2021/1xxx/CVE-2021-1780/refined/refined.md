- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A memory initialization issue in the Bluetooth component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper memory handling during the initialization process.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker in a privileged position may be able to cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs via the Bluetooth interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a privileged position, potentially indicating a need for some level of access or control over the Bluetooth connection/device.
