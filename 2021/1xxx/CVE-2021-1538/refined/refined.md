The provided content is related to CVE-2021-1538.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of configuration entries within the configuration dashboard of the Cisco Common Services Platform Collector (CSPC).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization, which allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands through the configuration options. This is a command injection vulnerability (CWE-78).

**Impact of exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the affected system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is remote, requiring network access to the CSPC configuration dashboard.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be authenticated as a super administrator on the CSPC system. The attacker needs to craft malicious input to configuration options on the CSPC configuration dashboard.
