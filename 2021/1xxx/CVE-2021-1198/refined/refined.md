Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1198:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from improper validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business RV series routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The web interface fails to properly sanitize user-provided data, allowing for the injection of malicious code or commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker, who has gained access to the web interface with valid admin credentials, can execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system of the device.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can lead to an unexpected restart of the device, causing a denial of service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable through crafted HTTP requests sent to the web-based management interface.
- **Remote:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely, either over the local LAN or the WAN (if remote management is enabled).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Admin Credentials:** The attacker needs valid administrator credentials for the affected device in order to exploit the vulnerability in the web-based management interface.

**Additional Notes:**

- The advisory mentions that the vulnerabilities are not dependent on each other and that software releases may be affected by different subsets of the mentioned vulnerabilities.
- No software updates will be released to fix this issue as the affected devices are end-of-life.
- No workarounds exist to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
- Cisco recommends migrating to other Cisco Small Business RV series routers (RV132W, RV160, or RV160W).
- This vulnerability is one of a large number of vulnerabilities affecting the same product line, all reported by ADLab of Venustech, and impacting the web-based management interface.
- The base CVSS score for this vulnerability is 7.2 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
