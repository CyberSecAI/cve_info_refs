Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-1115:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows, specifically within the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`)'s handling of private IOCTLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The primary weakness is a NULL pointer dereference. This occurs when the driver attempts to access memory through a pointer that is currently pointing to NULL.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS). The DoS occurs in a component beyond the vulnerable component, meaning the crash may not be isolated to the display driver but could impact the overall system stability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local. An attacker needs local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local, unprivileged system access. They don't need elevated privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
