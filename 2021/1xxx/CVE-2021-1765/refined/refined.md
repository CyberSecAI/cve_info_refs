Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-1765:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a sandbox policy violation within the WebKit component.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Iframe Sandboxing Policy Bypass:** The core weakness is the failure to properly enforce iframe sandboxing policies. This means a website could potentially bypass the restrictions intended to isolate embedded iframes, leading to cross-site scripting or other security breaches.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By bypassing the iframe sandbox, an attacker may be able to inject malicious scripts into a website, ultimately leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **Data Theft:** Exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to sensitive information disclosure.
*   **Cross-site scripting (XSS):** An attacker could inject malicious content into an iframe, potentially gaining access to user sessions, cookies, and other sensitive information, or deface the target webpage.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Web Content:** Attackers can exploit this vulnerability by enticing users to visit specially crafted web pages containing malicious code within an iframe, which then bypasses the intended sandbox restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Remote:** The attacker does not need physical access to the target system. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by enticing a user to visit a malicious web page or embedding malicious content in an iframe.
* **Ability to embed an iframe:** The attacker needs the ability to embed iframes within a web page that the victim might visit.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is present in WebKitGTK+ and WebKit components.
*   The vulnerability is addressed by improved iframe sandbox enforcement in affected software versions.
*   The content indicates active exploitation of related WebKit vulnerabilities, which could suggest that this vulnerability was also targeted.
