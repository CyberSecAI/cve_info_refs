Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1270:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly limit access to resources within the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM). Specifically, resources intended for users with *Administrator* privileges are accessible to users with lower privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Authorization Bypass:** The primary weakness is an authorization bypass vulnerability. The system fails to enforce proper access controls, allowing authenticated but low-privileged users to access and modify resources that should be restricted to administrators.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Configuration Modification:** A successful exploit allows a low-privileged attacker to modify the DCNM configuration. This could lead to various impacts depending on the specific configurations modified.
- **Integrity Impact:** The CVSS vector `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:L` indicates a high impact on integrity. This means an attacker can change or delete information.
- **Limited Availability Impact**: The CVSS vector also indicates a low impact on availability, meaning the attacker might be able to disrupt operations but not completely halt them.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack vector is classified as "Network" (`AV:N`), meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely over a network.
- **Crafted HTTP Request:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a crafted HTTP request to the affected DCNM device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authentication:** The attacker must have valid, non-administrative credentials to access the web interface. This means the attacker needs to be an authenticated user, though not an administrator.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected DCNM device.
- **Low privilege:** An attacker with non-administrative level access is able to exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

- This vulnerability is distinct from CVE-2021-1269, though both affect the same product and are included in the same advisory.
- No workarounds are available. Customers must apply software updates.
- Cisco DCNM releases prior to 11.5(1) are vulnerable.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
