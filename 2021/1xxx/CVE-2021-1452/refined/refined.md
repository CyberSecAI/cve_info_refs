Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-1452:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from incorrect validations of specific function arguments passed to a boot script within the ROM Monitor (ROMMON) of Cisco IOS XE Software when specific ROMMON variables are set.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- OS Command Injection (CWE-78) vulnerability due to improper input validation in the ROMMON software.
- Failure to properly validate function arguments passed to a boot script.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Allows an unauthenticated, physical attacker to execute unsigned code at system boot time.
- Bypasses the image verification check during the secure boot process.
- Potential for full system compromise by executing arbitrary, unsigned code.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Physical access to the affected device.
- Privileged access to the root shell on the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs physical, unauthenticated access to the device, or privileged access to the root shell on the device.
- The attacker must set malicious values for specific ROMMON variables.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Catalyst IE3200 Rugged Series Switches
- Cisco Catalyst IE3300 Rugged Series Switches
- Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Rugged Series Switches
- Cisco Catalyst IE3400 Heavy Duty Series Switches
- Cisco Embedded Services 3300 Series Switches (ESS 3300)
- Only when running a Cisco IOS XE ROMMON Software release earlier than 7.0

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Cisco IOS XE ROMMON Software release 7.0 or later.
- Upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Software release 17.3.1 or later. (ROMMON is bundled with the IOS XE image)
- Note that downgrading to an older IOS XE release will downgrade the ROMMON and reintroduce the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
-  No workarounds are available.
-  The vulnerability was found during internal security testing by X.B. of Cisco.
-  The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
-  The CVSS v3.1 base score is 6.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
