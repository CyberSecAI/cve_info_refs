- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows does not perform or incorrectly performs an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. This occurs in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for DxgkDdiEscape.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper authorization check leading to unauthorized access to resources or actions.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service of the display.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Local user with low privileges. The attack does not require user interaction.
