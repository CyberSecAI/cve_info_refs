Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-1595:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect processing of certain Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) packets at ingress time within the Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Improper handling of crafted LLDP packets leads to a memory leak.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A successful exploit can cause the affected device to continuously consume memory, eventually leading to a crash and reload, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker must be in the same broadcast domain (Layer 2 adjacent) as the vulnerable device.
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted LLDP packets to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker must be unauthenticated.
- The attacker needs to be on the same Layer 2 network segment as the targeted camera.
- No special user interaction is required for the attack to succeed.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras with firmware releases earlier than 2.12.4.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading the firmware to a fixed release.
- The provided CSAF document lists this CVE and three others, CVE-2021-1596, CVE-2021-1597 and CVE-2021-1598 all related to the same issue and resolved with the same fix.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 6.5, with a vector of AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H, indicating a medium severity.
- The document confirms that other Cisco Video Surveillance IP Camera series are not affected by this vulnerability.
- Cisco has released firmware updates (2.12.4 and later) to address the vulnerability.
