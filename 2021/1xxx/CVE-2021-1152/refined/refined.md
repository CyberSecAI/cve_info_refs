Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1152:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content, specifically the Cisco Security Advisory titled "Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers Management Interface Stored Cross-Site Scripting Vulnerabilities" explicitly mentions CVE-2021-1152 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed in the advisory. Therefore, the content is directly related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is **insufficient input validation** within the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business routers. The interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before rendering it in the browser.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - The primary weakness is the presence of a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability. This means that an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the router's configuration via crafted HTTP requests that are then stored and executed when an administrator accesses the affected interface.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
    - A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:
        - **Execute arbitrary script code** within the context of the affected web management interface.
        - **Access sensitive, browser-based information**, such as cookies, session tokens, or other data stored in the browser.
        - Potentially **rewrite the content of the HTML page** displayed in the management interface.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
    - The attack vector involves sending **crafted HTTP requests** to the vulnerable device's web-based management interface.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - The attacker requires **valid administrator credentials** on the affected device to exploit the vulnerability. They need to be able to log in to the web-based management interface.
    - The attacker can be **remote**, provided remote management is enabled on the router. By default, remote management is disabled; however, the management interface is always available through a local LAN connection.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Products:
    - RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall
