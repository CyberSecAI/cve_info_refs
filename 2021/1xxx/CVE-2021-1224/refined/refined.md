      "summary": "The provided documents discuss CVE-2021-1224, a vulnerability related to TCP Fast Open (TFO) in the Snort detection engine, which can be exploited to bypass configured file policies.",
      "details": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the Snort detection engine incorrectly handling HTTP payloads when they are contained at least partially within the TCP Fast Open (TFO) connection handshake.",
        "weaknesses": "Incorrect handling of HTTP payloads within the TFO handshake. This allows an attacker to send crafted TFO packets with an HTTP payload, bypassing file policies intended to prevent malicious file delivery.",
        "impact": "A successful exploit allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured file policies for HTTP traffic, potentially delivering malicious payloads to the protected network.",
        "attack_vectors": "Attackers send crafted TFO packets with an HTTP payload through an affected device.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic to an affected device. No authentication is required.",
        "additional_notes": "The documents provide detailed workarounds and fixed software information, as well as a description of the affected Cisco products. The vulnerability affects both Snort 2 and Snort 3 versions, with different workarounds for each. The provided documents also mention the public key needed to verify the authenticity of the emails. \n The issue also affects Open Source Snort releases."
