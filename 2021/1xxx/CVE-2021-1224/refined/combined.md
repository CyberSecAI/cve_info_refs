*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.8 |

# Intrusion Policies

The following topics explain intrusion policies and the closely
associated network analysis policies (NAP). Intrusion policies include rules
that check traffic for threats and block traffic that appears to be an attack.
Network analysis policies control traffic preprocessing, which prepares traffic
to be further inspected by normalizing traffic and identifying protocol
anomalies.

Because preprocessing and intrusion inspection are so closely related,
the network analysis and intrusion policies examining a single packet must
complement each other.

## About Intrusion and Network Analysis Policies

Network analysis and intrusion policies work together to detect and
prevent intrusion threats.

* A network analysis policy (NAP) governs how traffic is decoded and
  preprocessed so that it can be further evaluated, especially for anomalous
  traffic that might signal an intrusion attempt.
* An intrusion policy uses intrusion and preprocessor rules, which are
  collectively known as intrusion rules, to examine the decoded packets for
  attacks based on patterns. The rules can either prevent (drop) the threatening
  traffic and generate an event, or simply detect (alert) it and generate an
  event only.

As the system analyzes traffic, the network analysis decoding and
preprocessing phase occurs before and separately from the intrusion prevention
phase. Together, network analysis and intrusion policies provide broad and deep
packet inspection. They can help you detect, alert on, and protect against
network traffic that could threaten the availability, integrity, and
confidentiality of hosts and their data.

### System-Defined Network Analysis and Intrusion Policies

The system includes several pairs of same-named network analysis and intrusion policies that complement and work with each
other. For example there are both NAP and intrusion policies named “Balanced Security and Connectivity,” which are meant to
be used together. The system-provided policies are configured by the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos). For these policies, Talos sets the intrusion and preprocessor rule states and provides the initial configurations for preprocessors and other advanced
settings.

As new vulnerabilities become known, Talos releases intrusion rule updates. These rule updates can modify any system-provided network analysis or intrusion policy,
and can provide new and updated intrusion rules and preprocessor rules, modified states for existing rules, and modified default
policy settings. Rule updates might also delete rules from system-provided policies and provide new rule categories, as well
as modify the default variable set.

You can manually update the rules database, or configure a regular
update schedule. You must deploy an update for it to take effect. For more
information on updating system databases, see
[Updating System Databases](fptd-fdm-mgmt.html#id_11511).

The following are the system-provided policies:

Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis and intrusion
policies

These policies are built for both speed and detection. Used
together, they serve as a good starting point for most networks and deployment
types. The system uses the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis
policy as the default.

Connectivity Over Security network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where connectivity, the
ability to get to all resources, takes precedence over network infrastructure
security. The intrusion policy enables far fewer rules than those enabled in
the Security over Connectivity policy. Only the most critical rules that block
traffic are enabled.

Security Over Connectivity network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where network infrastructure
security takes precedence over user convenience. The intrusion policy enables
numerous network anomaly intrusion rules that could alert on or drop legitimate
traffic.

Maximum Detection network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where network infrastructure
security is given even more emphasis than is given by the Security Over
Connectivity policies, with the potential for even greater operational impact.
For example, the intrusion policy enables rules in a large number of threat
categories including malware, exploit kit, old and common vulnerabilities, and
known in-the-wild exploits.

### Inspection Mode: Prevention vs. Detection

By default, all intrusion policies operate in Prevention mode to implement an Intrusion
Prevention System (IPS). In the Prevention inspection mode, if a connection matches an
intrusion rule whose action is to drop traffic, the connection is actively blocked.

If you instead want to test the effect of the intrusion policy on your network, you can
change the mode to Detection, which implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). In
this inspection mode, drop rules are treated like alert rules, where you are notified of
matching connections, but the action result becomes Would Have Blocked, and connections
are never in fact blocked.

You change the inspection mode per intrusion policy, so you can have a mix of prevention
and detection.

### Intrusion and Preprocessor Rules

An intrusion rule is a specified set of keywords and arguments that the
system uses to detect attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in your network. As
the system analyzes network traffic, it compares packets against the conditions
specified in each rule, and triggers the rule if the data packet meets all the
conditions specified in the rule.

The system includes the following types of rules created by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos):

* Intrusion rules, which are subdivided into shared object rules and
  standard text rules
* Preprocessor rules, which are rules associated with preprocessors
  and packet decoder detection options in the network analysis policy. Most
  preprocessor rules are disabled by default.

The following topics explain intrusion rules in more depth.

* [Intrusion Rule Attributes](#concept_C4C21B1BDF794F468738C9F836C6C87B)
* [Default Intrusion Variable Set](#concept_AF54E757E6694EE4B08030A4EA1D737C)
* [Generator Identifiers](#concept_821B9C87DA8744CB8E3C2375A1DB3C9B)

#### Intrusion Rule Attributes

When you view an intrusion policy, you see a list of all the intrusion rules available for
identifying threats.

The list of rules for each policy is the same. The difference is in the action configured for each rule. Because there are
over 30,000 rules, scrolling through the list will take time. Rules are revealed as you scroll through the list.

Following are the
attributes that define each rule:

> (Signature
Description)

Click the > button in the left column to open the signature description. The description is the actual code used by the Snort inspection
engine to match traffic against the rule. Explaining the code is out of scope for this document, but it is explained in detail
in Management Center Configuration Guide; select the book for your software version from <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/defense-center/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html>. Look for information on intrusion rule editing.

The signatures
contain variables for certain items. For more information, see
[Default Intrusion Variable Set](#concept_AF54E757E6694EE4B08030A4EA1D737C).

GID

Generator Identifier (ID). This number indicates which system component evaluates the rule
and generates events. A 1 indicates a standard text intrusion rule, a 3
indicates a shared object intrusion rule. (The difference in these rule
types is not meaningful for a FDM user.) These are the main rules of interest when configuring an intrusion
policy. For information on the other GIDs, see [Generator Identifiers](#concept_821B9C87DA8744CB8E3C2375A1DB3C9B).

SID

Snort Identifier (ID), also called signature ID. Snort IDs lower than 1000000 were created by the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos).

Action

The state of
this rule in the selected intrusion policy. For each rule, “(Default)” is added
to the action that is the default action for the rule within this policy. To
return a rule to its default setting, you select this action. Possible actions
are:

* Alert—Create an
  event when this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the connection.
* Drop—Create an
  event when this rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection.
* Disabled—Do not
  match traffic against this rule. No events are generated.

Status

For Snort 2 rules, Status is a separate column. If you change the default
action for a rule, this column shows “Overridden.” Otherwise, the column is
empty.

For Snort 3 rules, the “Overridden” status is shown at the bottom of the
Action attribute, if you changed it.

Message

This is the name
of the rule, which also appears in events triggered by the rule. The message
typically identifies the threat that the signature matches. You can search the
Internet for more information on each threat.

#### Default Intrusion Variable Set

The intrusion rule
signatures contain variables for certain items. Following are the default
values for the variables, with $HOME\_NET and $EXTERNAL\_NET being the most
commonly used variables. Note that the protocol is specified separately from
port numbers, so port variables are numbers only.

* $DNS\_SERVERS =
  $HOME\_NET (meaning any IP address).
* $EXTERNAL\_NET =
  any IP address.
* $FILE\_DATA\_PORTS =
  $HTTP\_PORTS, 143, 110.

#### Generator Identifiers

The generator identifier (GID) identifies the subsystem that
evaluates an intrusion rule and generates events. Standard text intrusion rules
have a generator ID of 1, and shared
object intrusion rules have a generator ID of 3. There are also several sets of
rules for various preprocessors. The following table explains the GIDs.

Table 1. Generator IDs

| ID | Component |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Standard Text Rule. |
| 2 | Tagged Packets.  (Rules for the Tag generator, which generates packets from a tagged session. ) |
| 3 | Shared Object Rule. |
| 102 | HTTP Decoder. |
| 105 | Back Orifice Detector. |
| 106 | RPC Decoder. |
| 116 | Packet Decoder. |
| 119, 120 | HTTP Inspect Preprocessor.  (GID 120 rules relate to server-specific HTTP traffic.) |
| 122 | Portscan Detector. |
| 123 | IP Defragmentor. |
| 124 | SMTP Decoder.  (Exploits against SMTP verbs.) |
| 125 | FTP Decoder. |
| 126 | Telnet Decoder. |
| 128 | SSH Preprocessor. |
| 129 | Stream Preprocessor. |
| 131 | DNS Preprocessor. |
| 133 | DCE/RPC Preprocessor. |
| 134 | Rule Latency, Packet Latency.  (Events for these rules are generated when rule latency suspends (SID 1) or re-enables (SID 2) a group of intrusion rules, or when the system stops inspecting a packet because the packet latency threshold is exceeded (SID 3).) |
| 135 | Rate-Based Attack Detector.  (Excessive connections to hosts on the network.) |
| 137 | SSL Preprocessor. |
| 138, 139 | Sensitive Data Preprocessor. |
| 140 | SIP Preprocessor. |
| 141 | IMAP Preprocessor. |
| 142 | POP Preprocessor. |
| 143 | GTP Preprocessor. |
| 144 | Modbus Preprocessor. |
| 145 | DNP3 Preprocessor. |

### Network Analysis Policies

Network analysis policies control traffic preprocessing. Preprocessors prepare traffic to be
further inspected by normalizing traffic and identifying protocol anomalies. Network
analysis-related preprocessing occurs after Security Intelligence drops and SSL
decryption, but before access control and intrusion or file inspection.

By default, the system uses the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis
policy to preprocess all traffic handled by the access control policy. However, if
you configure an intrusion policy on any access control rule, the system uses the
network analysis policy that matches the most aggressive intrusion policy applied.
For example, if you use both Security over Connectivity and Balanced policies in
your access control rules, the system uses the Security over Connectivity NAP for
all traffic. For Snort 3 custom intrusion
policies, this assignment is done according to the base template policy assigned
to the intrusion policy.

## License Requirements for Intrusion Policies

You must enable the **Threat** license to apply intrusion policies in access control rules. For information on configuring licenses, see [Enabling or Disabling Optional Licenses](fptd-fdm-license.html#id_12247).

No extra license is needed for network analysis policies.

## Applying Intrusion Policies in Access Control Rules

To apply intrusion
policies to network traffic, you select the policy within an access control
rule that allows traffic. You do not directly assign intrusion policies.

You can assign
different intrusion policies to provide variable intrusion protection based on
the relative risks of the networks you are protecting. For example, you might
use the more stringent Security over Connectivity policy for traffic between
your inside network and external networks. On the other hand, you might apply
the more lenient Connectivity over Security policy for traffic between inside
networks.

You can also
simplify your configuration by using the same policy for all networks. For
example, the Balanced Security and Connectivity policy is design to provide
good protection without excessively impacting connectivity.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Either create a new rule, or edit an existing rule, that allows traffic.  If the default action is allow, you can also specify an intrusion policy in the default action.  You cannot apply intrusion policies to rules that trust or block traffic. |
| **Step 3** | Click the Intrusion Policy tab. |
| **Step 4** | Select Intrusion Policy > On and select the intrusion inspection policy to use on matching traffic. |

## Switching Between Snort 2 and Snort 3

Snort is the main inspection engine for the product. Although you can switch Snort
versions freely, some intrusion rules in Snort 2.0 might not exist in Snort 3.0, and
vice versa. If you changed the rule action for one of these rules, that change is
not preserved if you switch to Snort 3 and then back to Snort 2, or back again to
Snort 3. Your changes to rule actions for rules that exist in both versions are
preserved. Note that the mapping between rules in Snort 3 vs. Snort 2 can be
one-to-one or one-to-many, so preservation of changes is done on a best effort
basis.

Snort 3.0 does not support all features that
Snort 2.0 supports. Following are the unsupported features:

* Virtual routers. You cannot switch to Snort 3.0 if you have configured
  virtual routers.
* Time-based access control rules. You might have added time range objects to an access control rule using the FTD API. You cannot configure these kinds of rule through the FDM.
* The decryption of TLS 1.1 or lower connections using the SSL Decryption
  policy.
* The decryption of the following protocols using the SSL Decryption policy:
  FTPS, SMTPS, IMAPS, POP3S.

If you change the Snort version, the system will perform an automatic deployment to implement the change. You can see the
progress in the Task list. The tasks are Snort Version Change and Automatic Deployment—Snort version toggle. Because of the
deployment and the fact that Snort must be stopped and restarted, all existing connections, including VPN, are dropped and
must be reestablished, which will cause a momentary traffic loss.

| **Note** | ---   If you try to switch Snort versions and the switch fails, you will have pending changes that you cannot discard, and a subsequent toggle attempt will not be allowed. If this happens, you must complete the switch using the ToggleInspectionEngine API, which you can use from the API Explorer. You must set the bypassPendingChangeValidation attribute to TRUE.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

To determine which Snort version is currently enabled, use this procedure, or choose Policies > Intrusion. Look for the Snort Version line above the
table. The current version is the first number in the complete version number. For
example, 2.9.17-95 is a Snort 2 version.

If the device is in an air-gapped network, consider manually uploading the latest
rules package for the new version before switching.

If you downgrade to 2.0, any custom intrusion policies that you created are converted
to the base policy used in the custom policy. As far as possible, rule action
overrides are retained. If more than one custom policy uses the same base policy,
the overrides of the custom policy that is used in the most access control policies
are retained, and the overrides for the other custom policies are lost. Access
control rules that used these "duplicate" policies will now use the base policy
created from your most-used custom policy. All custom policies are deleted. If you
want to preserve the custom policies so that you can import them later, after
switching back to Snort 3, use the FTD API to export the configuration.

You must deploy any pending changes before you can switch Snort versions.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Device, then click View Configuration in the Updates summary.  Look at the Intrusion Rule group. The current Snort version is indicated. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | In the Intrusion Rule group, you can change the Snort version by clicking Upgrade to Snort 3.0 or Downgrade to Snort 2.0. |
| **Step 3** | When prompted to confirm your action, select the option to get the latest intrusion rules package, then click Yes.  We recommend that you get the latest rules package. The system downloads packages for the active Snort version only, so it is unlikely that you have the latest package installed for the Snort version you are switching to.  You must wait until the task to switch versions completes before you can edit intrusion policies. |

---

## Configuring Syslog for Intrusion Events

You can configure an external syslog server for intrusion policies to
send intrusion events to your syslog server. You must configure the syslog
server on the intrusion policy to get intrusion events sent to the server.
Configuring a syslog server on an access rule sends connection events only to
the syslog server, not intrusion events.

If you select multiple syslog servers, events are
sent to each of the servers.

Intrusion events have the message ID 430001.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Edit Logging Settings button (Gear/Settings button.) to configure syslog. |
| **Step 3** | Click the + button under Send Intrusion Events To and select the server objects that define the syslog servers. If the required objects do not already exist, click Create New Syslog Server and create them. |
| **Step 4** | Click OK. |

## Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 3)

When you use Snort 3 as the inspection engine, you can create your own intrusion
policies and customize them for your purposes. The system comes with pre-defined
policies that are based on the same-named Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos)-defined policies. Although you can edit these policies, a better practice is to
create your own policy based on the underlying Talos policy and change that if you need to adjust rule actions.

Each of these pre-defined policies includes the same list of intrusion rules (also
known as signatures), but they differ in the actions taken for each rule. For
example, a rule might be enabled in one policy, but disabled in another policy.

If you find that a particular rule is giving you too many false positives, where the
rule is blocking traffic that you do not want blocked, you can disable the rule
without needing to switch to a less-secure intrusion policy. You could alternatively
change it to alert on matches without dropping traffic.

Conversely, if you know you need to protect against a specific attack, but the
related rule is disabled in your chosen intrusion policy, you can enable the rule
without changing to a more secure policy.

Use the intrusion related dashboards, and the Event Viewer (both on the
Monitoring page), to evaluate how intrusion rules are
impacting traffic. Keep in mind that you will see intrusion events and intrusion
data only for traffic that matches intrusion rules set to alert or drop; disabled
rules are not evaluated.

| **Note** | ---   If you switch to Snort 2, you cannot create custom policies, and the use of intrusion policies differs slightly. Instead of this topic, see [Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 2)](#concept_C0EB1AB846C945C38FE3940BBC8803F7).   --- |

### Configuring a Custom Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)

You can create new intrusion policies to customize rule behavior if the pre-defined
policies do not fit your needs. In general, it is good practice to create custom
policies based on the pre-defined policies rather than to alter those policies. This
ensures you can easily implement one of the Cisco Talos defined policies if you find
that your customizations do not deliver the results that you need.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do one of the following:   * To create a new policy, click +. * To edit an existing policy, click the edit icon (edit icon) for the policy. When you are shown the policy details, click the   Edit link in the policy properties   section at the top of the page. |
| **Step 3** | Enter a Name, and optionally, a description for the policy. |
| **Step 4** | Configure the Inspection Mode for the policy.   * Prevention—Intrusion rule actions are always   applied. Connections that match a drop rule are blocked. * Detection—Intrusion rules generate alerts   only. A connection that matches a drop rule will generate alert   messages, but the connection will not be blocked. |
| **Step 5** | Select the Base Template for the policy.  The base templates are provided by Cisco Talos. Click the info icon for each to see more information about the policies. Note that policy names can change, and new policies appear, when a new rules package gets installed.   * Maximum Detection (Cisco Talos)—This policy   places all emphasis on security. Network connectivity and throughput   is not guaranteed and false positives are likely. This policy should   only be used for high security areas and security monitors must be   prepared to investigate alerts to determine their validity. * Security Over Connectivity (Cisco Talos)—This   policy places an emphasis on security, at the possible expense of   network connectivity and throughput. Traffic is inspected more   deeply, more rules are evaluated, and both false positives and   increased latency are expected but within reason. * Balanced Security and Connectivity (Cisco   Talos)—(Default.) This policy attempts to strike the   delicate balance between network connectivity and throughput and the   needs of security. While not as strict as Security Over   Connectivity, this policy attempts to keep users secure while being   less obtrusive about normal traffic. * Connectivity Over Security (Cisco Talos)—This   policy places an emphasis on network connectivity and throughput, at   the possible expense of security. Traffic is inspected less deeply,   and fewer rules are evaluated. * No Rules Active (Cisco Talos)—This policy is a   basic policy that configures typical preprocessor settings but does   not have any rules or built-in alerts enabled. Use this policy as a   base if you want to ensure that only those policies you want to   apply are enabled. |
| **Step 6** | Click OK.  You are returned to the intrusion policy list. You can now view the new policy and adjust rule actions as needed. |

---

### Viewing or Editing Intrusion Policy Properties (Snort 3)

The Intrusion Policy page shows a list of the policies, including both pre-defined
and user-defined policies, and their descriptions. To edit a policy, you must first
view the policy's properties.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for a policy.  The policy contains the following sections:   * Policy Name drop-down list.    + You can easily switch to a different policy by selecting it     from the drop-down list, or return to the list of policies     by clicking the back button (Go Back to Virtual Routers arrow.).   + You can delete this policy by clicking the delete icon next     to the policy name (delete icon). * General properties. This section shows the   intrusion mode, base policy, and description. Click   Edit to change these properties or the   policy name. * Rule Group table of contents. This list   displays all the rule groups that have active rules in the policy.   The groups have a hierarchy, with parent groups containing child   groups that organize subsets of rules within the larger parent   group. Each group is a logical collection of rules, and a given rule   can appear in more than one group.    + To add a group that currently has no active rules in the     policy, click + and select the group. See [Adding or Removing Rule Groups in an Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_2d4f4706-b442-4ed1-8d9f-73abb005f21a).   + To change the security level of a group, select the child     group in the list. The rule list changes to show the     security level at the top, with the rules in the group     listed below. Click the Edit link     next to the security level and select a new level. Click     View Description when editing to     get information about each security level. Note that     changing the level can change which rules are active, and     also the action for a given rule, with more secure levels     tending to have more active rules and more rules with the     Drop action. Click OK to confirm the     change.      Changing the security level for an existing rule group.   + To remove all the rules in a group, select the child group in     the list. Then, click the Exclude     link to the far right of the group name and confirm that you     want to exclude the group. Excluding the group simply     disables all the rules in the group. It does not delete the     group.  However, if the group includes rules that are shared with     other groups that are enabled, the shared rules retain     whatever actions are applied by the still-active group. In     all cases, we retain your most aggressive setting for an     individual rule, regardless of group membership. * List of rules. You can use the search field to   help you find rules using full-text search. You can also select   filtering items to search on any combination of GID or SID, or   simply show rules based on their actions (disabled, alert, drop).   The rules are lazy-loaded, so it will take quite a bit of time to   scroll through the entire unfiltered list. When filtering the list,   click the refresh button to reload the filtered view.    + To change the action for a rule, click the     Action cell for the rule and     select the new action, to Alert only,     to Block matching traffic, or to     Disable the rule. The default     action for each rule is indicated.   + To change the action for more than one rule at a time, click     the check box in the left column of the rules you want to     change, then select the new action from the     Action drop-down list above the     rules table. Click the check box in the GID:SID header to     select all the rules in the list. You can change up to 5000     rules at a time.   + To get more information about a rule, click the link in the     GID:SID cell. The link takes you     to Snort.org.   + To change the rules listed, you can click a child group from     the rule group table of contents (not a parent group). You     can return to the all-rules list by clicking ALL     RULES at the top of the rule group list.   + To change the sorting order, click the table header for a     column. The default sorting for the rules is overridden     rules first, then drop rules, then alert rules. |

### Adding or Removing Rule Groups in an Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)

Intrusion rules are organized in local groups. There is a hierarchy to the groups,
with parent groups containing related child groups. The rules themselves appear in
child groups only: parent groups are simply an organizational construct. A given
rule can appear in more than one group.

The easiest way to add or remove rules in an intrusion policy is to add or remove
groups. Because the rules in a group are logically related, it is highly likely that
you will want to use most if not all rules within a given group.

The following procedure explains how to add groups and change the group’s security
level.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for the policy you want to change. |
| **Step 3** | (Adding groups.) If the group is not shown in the list of rule groups, click + and do the following:   1. Find the child group.     * A check mark next to a parent group name indicates that all      child groups in the parent group are already selected.    * A minus mark next to a parent group name indicates that one      or more child group has no enabled rules for this policy.      These are the groups you can add.    * A check mark next to a child group name indicates the group      is already selected. 2. Select the group you want to add (that is, check its check box). 3. (Optional.) Each group has a default security level depending    on the base policy used for the custom policy. If you want to change it,    click the security level icon, select a new level, and click    OK.  Level 1 is the least secure posture, emphasizing connectivity over    security, whereas level 4 is the most aggressive, providing maximum    security. You can click View Description to    see an explanation of each level as you select it.     Changing security level while adding a rule group. 4. Continue selecting (or deselecting) groups until you have made all of    your changes. 5. Click OK. |
| **Step 4** | (Removing groups.) If you want to disable all the rules within a group, you can use any of the following methods:   * Select the group, then click the Exclude link   to the far right of the group name, above the list of rules. * Use the method for adding a group, but instead, deselect the unwanted   group (that is, uncheck its check box), and click   OK. |

### Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 3)

Each intrusion policy has the same rules. The difference is the action taken for each
rule can be different from policy to policy.

By changing the rule action, you can disable rules that are giving you too many false
positives, or you can change whether the rule alerts on or drops matching traffic.
You can also enable disabled rules to alert or drop matching traffic.

The easiest method to change rule actions is to change the security level of a rule
group. When you change a group's security level, the action of the rules within the
group change. This can mean that some rules become enabled (or disabled), or the
action can change between alert and drop, based on the security posture you select.
However, you can change an individual rule action if that is what you need.

| **Note** | ---   The default action for a given rule is based on the overall selection of group and severity. Changing the severity of the group, or excluding the group, can change the default action for the rule.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the view icon (View configuration button.) for the policy whose rule actions you want to change. |
| **Step 3** | (Recommended method.) Change the security level for a rule group.   1. Click the child rule group in the rule group list. 2. Above the list of rules, click Edit next to the    security level for the group.     Changing the security level for an existing rule group.        | **Note** | If you want to disable all the rules in the group, do not click Edit. Instead, click Exclude and confirm that you want to exclude the group. The group is not deleted, its rules are simply disabled. Skip the remaining steps. |    | --- | --- | 3. Select the new level for the group. Click View    Description to see an explanation of each level as you    pick it.  Level 1 is the least secure posture, emphasizing connectivity over    security, whereas level 4 is the most aggressive, providing maximum    security. 4. Click OK. |
| **Step 4** | (Manual method.) Change the action for one or more rule.   1. Find the rule whose action you want to change.  Use the Search/Filter box to search on strings    within the rule information. You can also select filtering items to    search on any combination of GID or SID, or simply show rules based    on their actions (disabled, alert, drop). The rules are lazy-loaded,    so it will take quite a bit of time to scroll through the entire    unfiltered list. When filtering the list, click the refresh button    to reload the filtered view.  Ideally, you can get the Snort identifier (SID) and generator    identifier (GID) from an event or from Cisco Technical Support, if    you are working with them on an issue. You can then search precisely    for the rule. 2. To change the action, do one of the following:     * Change one rule at a time—Click the      Action column for the rule and      select the required action:       + Alert—Create an event when        this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the        connection.      + Drop—Create an event when this        rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection.      + Disabled—Do not match traffic        against this rule. No events are generated.    * Change multiple rules at one time—Click the check boxes for      the rules you want to change, then click the      Bulk drop-down above the table      and pick the desired action. Click the check box in the      GID:SID header to select all the rules in the list. You can      change up to 5000 rules at a time. |

## Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 2)

You can apply any of the pre-defined intrusion policies. Each of these policies includes the same
list of intrusion rules (also known as signatures), but they differ in the actions taken
for each rule. For example, a rule might be active in one policy, but disabled in
another policy.

If you find that a
particular rule is giving you too many false positives, where the rule is
blocking traffic that you do not want blocked, you can disable the rule without
needing to switch to a less-secure intrusion policy. You could alternatively
change it to alert on matches without dropping traffic.

Conversely, if you know you need to protect against a specific attack, but the related rule is disabled in your chosen intrusion
policy, you can enable the rule without changing to a more secure policy.

Use the intrusion
related dashboards, and the Event Viewer (both on the
Monitoring page), to evaluate how intrusion rules
are impacting traffic. Keep in mind that you will see intrusion events and
intrusion data only for traffic that matches intrusion rules set to alert or
drop; disabled rules are not evaluated.

The following topics
explain intrusion policies and rule tuning in more detail.

* [Configure the Inspection Mode for an Intrusion Policy (Snort 2)](#id_121662)
* [Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)](#task_4D5DD40DDCE0426C8846E5684287E63B)

### Configure the Inspection Mode for an Intrusion Policy (Snort 2)

By default, all intrusion policies operate in Prevention mode to implement an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). In the Prevention
inspection mode, if a connection matches an intrusion rule whose action is to drop traffic, the connection is actively blocked.

If you instead want to test the effect of the intrusion policy on your network, you can change the mode to Detection, which
implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). In this inspection mode, drop rules are treat like alert rules, where you
are notified of matching connections, but the action result becomes Would Have Blocked, and connections are never in fact
blocked.

You change the inspection mode per intrusion policy, so you can have a mix of prevention and detection.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the tab for the intrusion policy whose inspection mode you want to change.  The Inspection Mode is indicated above the rules table. |
| **Step 3** | Click the Edit link next to the inspection mode, change the mode for the policy, and click OK.  The options are:   * Prevention—Intrusion rule actions are always applied. Connections that match a drop rule are blocked. * Detection—Intrusion rules generate alerts only. A connection that matches a drop rule will generate alert messages, but the connection   will not be blocked. |

---

### Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)

Each pre-defined
intrusion policy has the same rules. The difference is the action taken for
each rule can be different from policy to policy.

By changing the rule action, you can disable rules that are giving you too many false positives, or you can change whether
the rule alerts on or drops matching traffic. You can also enable disabled rules to alert or drop matching traffic.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the tab for the intrusion policy whose rule actions you want to change.  The pre-defined policies are:   * Connectivity   over Security * Balanced   Security and Connectivity * Security   over Connectivity * Maximum   Detection |
| **Step 3** | Find the rule whose action you want to change.  The rules are sorted with the overridden ones listed first, and sorted by action within the group of overridden rules. Otherwise, the rules are sorted by GID, then SID.  Use the search box to locate the rule you want to change. Ideally, you can get the Snort identifier (SID) and generator identifier (GID) from an event or from Cisco Technical Support, if you are working with them on an issue.  For detailed information about the elements of each rule, see [Intrusion Rule Attributes](#concept_C4C21B1BDF794F468738C9F836C6C87B).  To search the list:   1. Click in the    Search box to open the search attributes dialog box. 2. Enter a    combination of Generator ID (GID), Snort ID (SID), or rule    Action, and click    Search.  For example,    you could select    Action = Drop to see all the rules in the policy    that will drop matching connections. The text beside the search box indicates    how many rules match your criteria, for example, “8937 of 9416 rules found.”  To clear a    search criteria, click the x for the criteria in the search box. |
| **Step 4** | Click the Action column for the rule and select the required action:   * Alert—Create an   event when this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the connection. * Drop—Create an   event when this rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection. * Disabled—Do not   match traffic against this rule. No events are generated.   The default action for the rule is indicated by “(Default)” added to the action. If you change the default, the status column indicates “Overridden” for that rule. |

## Monitoring Intrusion Policies

You can find intrusion
policy statistics on the
Attackers and
Targets dashboards on the
Monitoring page. You must apply an intrusion policy
to at least one access control rule to see any information on these dashboards.
See
[Monitoring Traffic and System Dashboards](fptd-fdm-monitor.html#id_10212).

To see intrusion
events, select
Monitoring > Events, then click the
Intrusion tab. You can hover over an event and
click the
View Details link to get more information. From
the details page, you can click the
View IPS Rule to go to the rule in the relevant
intrusion policy, where you can change the rule action. This can help you
reduce the impact of false positives, where a rule is blocking too many good
connections, by changing the action from drop to alert. Conversely, you can
change an alert rule into a drop rule if you are seeing a lot of attack traffic
for a rule.

If you configure a syslog server for the intrusion policy, intrusion events have the message ID 430001.

# Intrusion Policies

The following topics explain intrusion policies and the closely
associated network analysis policies (NAP). Intrusion policies include rules
that check traffic for threats and block traffic that appears to be an attack.
Network analysis policies control traffic preprocessing, which prepares traffic
to be further inspected by normalizing traffic and identifying protocol
anomalies.

Because preprocessing and intrusion inspection are so closely related,
the network analysis and intrusion policies examining a single packet must
complement each other.

## About Intrusion and Network Analysis Policies

Network analysis and intrusion policies work together to detect and
prevent intrusion threats.

* A network analysis policy (NAP) governs how traffic is decoded and
  preprocessed so that it can be further evaluated, especially for anomalous
  traffic that might signal an intrusion attempt.
* An intrusion policy uses intrusion and preprocessor rules, which are
  collectively known as intrusion rules, to examine the decoded packets for
  attacks based on patterns. The rules can either prevent (drop) the threatening
  traffic and generate an event, or simply detect (alert) it and generate an
  event only.

As the system analyzes traffic, the network analysis decoding and
preprocessing phase occurs before and separately from the intrusion prevention
phase. Together, network analysis and intrusion policies provide broad and deep
packet inspection. They can help you detect, alert on, and protect against
network traffic that could threaten the availability, integrity, and
confidentiality of hosts and their data.

### System-Defined Network Analysis and Intrusion Policies

The system includes several pairs of same-named network analysis and intrusion policies that complement and work with each
other. For example there are both NAP and intrusion policies named “Balanced Security and Connectivity,” which are meant to
be used together. The system-provided policies are configured by the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos). For these policies, Talos sets the intrusion and preprocessor rule states and provides the initial configurations for preprocessors and other advanced
settings.

As new vulnerabilities become known, Talos releases intrusion rule updates. These rule updates can modify any system-provided network analysis or intrusion policy,
and can provide new and updated intrusion rules and preprocessor rules, modified states for existing rules, and modified default
policy settings. Rule updates might also delete rules from system-provided policies and provide new rule categories, as well
as modify the default variable set.

You can manually update the rules database, or configure a regular
update schedule. You must deploy an update for it to take effect. For more
information on updating system databases, see
[Updating System Databases](fptd-fdm-mgmt.html#id_11511).

The following are the system-provided policies:

Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis and intrusion
policies

These policies are built for both speed and detection. Used
together, they serve as a good starting point for most networks and deployment
types. The system uses the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis
policy as the default.

Connectivity Over Security network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where connectivity, the
ability to get to all resources, takes precedence over network infrastructure
security. The intrusion policy enables far fewer rules than those enabled in
the Security over Connectivity policy. Only the most critical rules that block
traffic are enabled.

Security Over Connectivity network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where network infrastructure
security takes precedence over user convenience. The intrusion policy enables
numerous network anomaly intrusion rules that could alert on or drop legitimate
traffic.

Maximum Detection network analysis and intrusion policies

These policies are built for networks where network infrastructure
security is given even more emphasis than is given by the Security Over
Connectivity policies, with the potential for even greater operational impact.
For example, the intrusion policy enables rules in a large number of threat
categories including malware, exploit kit, old and common vulnerabilities, and
known in-the-wild exploits.

### Inspection Mode: Prevention vs. Detection

By default, all intrusion policies operate in Prevention mode to implement an Intrusion
Prevention System (IPS). In the Prevention inspection mode, if a connection matches an
intrusion rule whose action is to drop traffic, the connection is actively blocked.

If you instead want to test the effect of the intrusion policy on your network, you can
change the mode to Detection, which implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). In
this inspection mode, drop rules are treated like alert rules, where you are notified of
matching connections, but the action result becomes Would Have Blocked, and connections
are never in fact blocked.

You change the inspection mode per intrusion policy, so you can have a mix of prevention
and detection.

### Intrusion and Preprocessor Rules

An intrusion rule is a specified set of keywords and arguments that the
system uses to detect attempts to exploit vulnerabilities in your network. As
the system analyzes network traffic, it compares packets against the conditions
specified in each rule, and triggers the rule if the data packet meets all the
conditions specified in the rule.

The system includes the following types of rules created by Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos):

* Intrusion rules, which are subdivided into shared object rules and
  standard text rules
* Preprocessor rules, which are rules associated with preprocessors
  and packet decoder detection options in the network analysis policy. Most
  preprocessor rules are disabled by default.

The following topics explain intrusion rules in more depth.

* [Intrusion Rule Attributes](#concept_C4C21B1BDF794F468738C9F836C6C87B)
* [Default Intrusion Variable Set](#concept_AF54E757E6694EE4B08030A4EA1D737C)
* [Generator Identifiers](#concept_821B9C87DA8744CB8E3C2375A1DB3C9B)

#### Intrusion Rule Attributes

When you view an intrusion policy, you see a list of all the intrusion rules available for
identifying threats.

The list of rules for each policy is the same. The difference is in the action configured for each rule. Because there are
over 30,000 rules, scrolling through the list will take time. Rules are revealed as you scroll through the list.

Following are the
attributes that define each rule:

> (Signature
Description)

Click the > button in the left column to open the signature description. The description is the actual code used by the Snort inspection
engine to match traffic against the rule. Explaining the code is out of scope for this document, but it is explained in detail
in Management Center Configuration Guide; select the book for your software version from <http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/security/defense-center/products-installation-and-configuration-guides-list.html>. Look for information on intrusion rule editing.

The signatures
contain variables for certain items. For more information, see
[Default Intrusion Variable Set](#concept_AF54E757E6694EE4B08030A4EA1D737C).

GID

Generator Identifier (ID). This number indicates which system component evaluates the rule
and generates events. A 1 indicates a standard text intrusion rule, a 3
indicates a shared object intrusion rule. (The difference in these rule
types is not meaningful for a FDM user.) These are the main rules of interest when configuring an intrusion
policy. For information on the other GIDs, see [Generator Identifiers](#concept_821B9C87DA8744CB8E3C2375A1DB3C9B).

SID

Snort Identifier (ID), also called signature ID. Snort IDs lower than 1000000 were created by the Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos).

Action

The state of
this rule in the selected intrusion policy. For each rule, “(Default)” is added
to the action that is the default action for the rule within this policy. To
return a rule to its default setting, you select this action. Possible actions
are:

* Alert—Create an
  event when this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the connection.
* Drop—Create an
  event when this rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection.
* Disabled—Do not
  match traffic against this rule. No events are generated.

Status

For Snort 2 rules, Status is a separate column. If you change the default
action for a rule, this column shows “Overridden.” Otherwise, the column is
empty.

For Snort 3 rules, the “Overridden” status is shown at the bottom of the
Action attribute, if you changed it.

Message

This is the name
of the rule, which also appears in events triggered by the rule. The message
typically identifies the threat that the signature matches. You can search the
Internet for more information on each threat.

#### Default Intrusion Variable Set

The intrusion rule
signatures contain variables for certain items. Following are the default
values for the variables, with $HOME\_NET and $EXTERNAL\_NET being the most
commonly used variables. Note that the protocol is specified separately from
port numbers, so port variables are numbers only.

* $DNS\_SERVERS =
  $HOME\_NET (meaning any IP address).
* $EXTERNAL\_NET =
  any IP address.
* $FILE\_DATA\_PORTS =
  $HTTP\_PORTS, 143, 110.

#### Generator Identifiers

The generator identifier (GID) identifies the subsystem that
evaluates an intrusion rule and generates events. Standard text intrusion rules
have a generator ID of 1, and shared
object intrusion rules have a generator ID of 3. There are also several sets of
rules for various preprocessors. The following table explains the GIDs.

Table 1. Generator IDs

| ID | Component |
| --- | --- |
| 1 | Standard Text Rule. |
| 2 | Tagged Packets.  (Rules for the Tag generator, which generates packets from a tagged session. ) |
| 3 | Shared Object Rule. |
| 102 | HTTP Decoder. |
| 105 | Back Orifice Detector. |
| 106 | RPC Decoder. |
| 116 | Packet Decoder. |
| 119, 120 | HTTP Inspect Preprocessor.  (GID 120 rules relate to server-specific HTTP traffic.) |
| 122 | Portscan Detector. |
| 123 | IP Defragmentor. |
| 124 | SMTP Decoder.  (Exploits against SMTP verbs.) |
| 125 | FTP Decoder. |
| 126 | Telnet Decoder. |
| 128 | SSH Preprocessor. |
| 129 | Stream Preprocessor. |
| 131 | DNS Preprocessor. |
| 133 | DCE/RPC Preprocessor. |
| 134 | Rule Latency, Packet Latency.  (Events for these rules are generated when rule latency suspends (SID 1) or re-enables (SID 2) a group of intrusion rules, or when the system stops inspecting a packet because the packet latency threshold is exceeded (SID 3).) |
| 135 | Rate-Based Attack Detector.  (Excessive connections to hosts on the network.) |
| 137 | SSL Preprocessor. |
| 138, 139 | Sensitive Data Preprocessor. |
| 140 | SIP Preprocessor. |
| 141 | IMAP Preprocessor. |
| 142 | POP Preprocessor. |
| 143 | GTP Preprocessor. |
| 144 | Modbus Preprocessor. |
| 145 | DNP3 Preprocessor. |

### Network Analysis Policies

Network analysis policies control traffic preprocessing. Preprocessors prepare traffic to be
further inspected by normalizing traffic and identifying protocol anomalies. Network
analysis-related preprocessing occurs after Security Intelligence drops and SSL
decryption, but before access control and intrusion or file inspection.

By default, the system uses the Balanced Security and Connectivity network analysis
policy to preprocess all traffic handled by the access control policy. However, if
you configure an intrusion policy on any access control rule, the system uses the
network analysis policy that matches the most aggressive intrusion policy applied.
For example, if you use both Security over Connectivity and Balanced policies in
your access control rules, the system uses the Security over Connectivity NAP for
all traffic. For Snort 3 custom intrusion
policies, this assignment is done according to the base template policy assigned
to the intrusion policy.

## License Requirements for Intrusion Policies

You must enable the **Threat** license to apply intrusion policies in access control rules. For information on configuring licenses, see [Enabling or Disabling Optional Licenses](fptd-fdm-license.html#id_12247).

No extra license is needed for network analysis policies.

## Applying Intrusion Policies in Access Control Rules

To apply intrusion
policies to network traffic, you select the policy within an access control
rule that allows traffic. You do not directly assign intrusion policies.

You can assign
different intrusion policies to provide variable intrusion protection based on
the relative risks of the networks you are protecting. For example, you might
use the more stringent Security over Connectivity policy for traffic between
your inside network and external networks. On the other hand, you might apply
the more lenient Connectivity over Security policy for traffic between inside
networks.

You can also
simplify your configuration by using the same policy for all networks. For
example, the Balanced Security and Connectivity policy is design to provide
good protection without excessively impacting connectivity.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Access Control. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Either create a new rule, or edit an existing rule, that allows traffic.  If the default action is allow, you can also specify an intrusion policy in the default action.  You cannot apply intrusion policies to rules that trust or block traffic. |
| **Step 3** | Click the Intrusion Policy tab. |
| **Step 4** | Select Intrusion Policy > On and select the intrusion inspection policy to use on matching traffic. |

## Switching Between Snort 2 and Snort 3

Snort is the main inspection engine for the product. Although you can switch Snort
versions freely, some intrusion rules in Snort 2.0 might not exist in Snort 3.0, and
vice versa. If you changed the rule action for one of these rules, that change is
not preserved if you switch to Snort 3 and then back to Snort 2, or back again to
Snort 3. Your changes to rule actions for rules that exist in both versions are
preserved. Note that the mapping between rules in Snort 3 vs. Snort 2 can be
one-to-one or one-to-many, so preservation of changes is done on a best effort
basis.

Snort 3.0 does not support all features that
Snort 2.0 supports. Following are the unsupported features:

* Virtual routers. You cannot switch to Snort 3.0 if you have configured
  virtual routers.
* Time-based access control rules. You might have added time range objects to an access control rule using the FTD API. You cannot configure these kinds of rule through the FDM.
* The decryption of TLS 1.1 or lower connections using the SSL Decryption
  policy.
* The decryption of the following protocols using the SSL Decryption policy:
  FTPS, SMTPS, IMAPS, POP3S.

If you change the Snort version, the system will perform an automatic deployment to implement the change. You can see the
progress in the Task list. The tasks are Snort Version Change and Automatic Deployment—Snort version toggle. Because of the
deployment and the fact that Snort must be stopped and restarted, all existing connections, including VPN, are dropped and
must be reestablished, which will cause a momentary traffic loss.

| **Note** | ---   If you try to switch Snort versions and the switch fails, you will have pending changes that you cannot discard, and a subsequent toggle attempt will not be allowed. If this happens, you must complete the switch using the ToggleInspectionEngine API, which you can use from the API Explorer. You must set the bypassPendingChangeValidation attribute to TRUE.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Before you begin

To determine which Snort version is currently enabled, use this procedure, or choose Policies > Intrusion. Look for the Snort Version line above the
table. The current version is the first number in the complete version number. For
example, 2.9.17-95 is a Snort 2 version.

If the device is in an air-gapped network, consider manually uploading the latest
rules package for the new version before switching.

If you downgrade to 2.0, any custom intrusion policies that you created are converted
to the base policy used in the custom policy. As far as possible, rule action
overrides are retained. If more than one custom policy uses the same base policy,
the overrides of the custom policy that is used in the most access control policies
are retained, and the overrides for the other custom policies are lost. Access
control rules that used these "duplicate" policies will now use the base policy
created from your most-used custom policy. All custom policies are deleted. If you
want to preserve the custom policies so that you can import them later, after
switching back to Snort 3, use the FTD API to export the configuration.

You must deploy any pending changes before you can switch Snort versions.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Device, then click View Configuration in the Updates summary.  Look at the Intrusion Rule group. The current Snort version is indicated. |

| **Step 2** | In the Intrusion Rule group, you can change the Snort version by clicking Upgrade to Snort 3.0 or Downgrade to Snort 2.0. |
| **Step 3** | When prompted to confirm your action, select the option to get the latest intrusion rules package, then click Yes.  We recommend that you get the latest rules package. The system downloads packages for the active Snort version only, so it is unlikely that you have the latest package installed for the Snort version you are switching to.  You must wait until the task to switch versions completes before you can edit intrusion policies. |

## Configuring Syslog for Intrusion Events

You can configure an external syslog server for intrusion policies to
send intrusion events to your syslog server. You must configure the syslog
server on the intrusion policy to get intrusion events sent to the server.
Configuring a syslog server on an access rule sends connection events only to
the syslog server, not intrusion events.

If you select multiple syslog servers, events are
sent to each of the servers.

Intrusion events have the message ID 430001.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the Edit Logging Settings button (Gear/Settings button.) to configure syslog. |
| **Step 3** | Click the + button under Send Intrusion Events To and select the server objects that define the syslog servers. If the required objects do not already exist, click Create New Syslog Server and create them. |
| **Step 4** | Click OK. |

## Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 3)

When you use Snort 3 as the inspection engine, you can create your own intrusion
policies and customize them for your purposes. The system comes with pre-defined
policies that are based on the same-named Cisco Talos Intelligence Group
(Talos)-defined policies. Although you can edit these policies, a better practice is to
create your own policy based on the underlying Talos policy and change that if you need to adjust rule actions.

Each of these pre-defined policies includes the same list of intrusion rules (also
known as signatures), but they differ in the actions taken for each rule. For
example, a rule might be enabled in one policy, but disabled in another policy.

If you find that a particular rule is giving you too many false positives, where the
rule is blocking traffic that you do not want blocked, you can disable the rule
without needing to switch to a less-secure intrusion policy. You could alternatively
change it to alert on matches without dropping traffic.

Conversely, if you know you need to protect against a specific attack, but the
related rule is disabled in your chosen intrusion policy, you can enable the rule
without changing to a more secure policy.

Use the intrusion related dashboards, and the Event Viewer (both on the
Monitoring page), to evaluate how intrusion rules are
impacting traffic. Keep in mind that you will see intrusion events and intrusion
data only for traffic that matches intrusion rules set to alert or drop; disabled
rules are not evaluated.

| **Note** | ---   If you switch to Snort 2, you cannot create custom policies, and the use of intrusion policies differs slightly. Instead of this topic, see [Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 2)](#concept_C0EB1AB846C945C38FE3940BBC8803F7).   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion.  Verify that the Snort version shown above the table is 3.x. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do any of the following:   * Use the Search/Filter box to find a policy.   You can search by name only. * Click the gear icon (Gear/Settings button.) to enable logging to a syslog server. See [Configuring Syslog for Intrusion Events](#task_3C0D47785EF24FCB88E6E671705E10E8). * Click + to create a new policy. See [Configuring a Custom Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_577e0181-dbc9-492b-90b8-a4b59bd381f0). * Click the edit icon (edit icon) to see the properties and rules in the policy, and to edit them.   See [Viewing or Editing Intrusion Policy Properties (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_6faed926-3676-491a-9639-25912f85d7b3). * Click the delete icon (delete icon) to delete a policy. |

### Configuring a Custom Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)

You can create new intrusion policies to customize rule behavior if the pre-defined
policies do not fit your needs. In general, it is good practice to create custom
policies based on the pre-defined policies rather than to alter those policies. This
ensures you can easily implement one of the Cisco Talos defined policies if you find
that your customizations do not deliver the results that you need.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Do one of the following:   * To create a new policy, click +. * To edit an existing policy, click the edit icon (edit icon) for the policy. When you are shown the policy details, click the   Edit link in the policy properties   section at the top of the page. |
| **Step 3** | Enter a Name, and optionally, a description for the policy. |
| **Step 4** | Configure the Inspection Mode for the policy.   * Prevention—Intrusion rule actions are always   applied. Connections that match a drop rule are blocked. * Detection—Intrusion rules generate alerts   only. A connection that matches a drop rule will generate alert   messages, but the connection will not be blocked. |
| **Step 5** | Select the Base Template for the policy.  The base templates are provided by Cisco Talos. Click the info icon for each to see more information about the policies. Note that policy names can change, and new policies appear, when a new rules package gets installed.   * Maximum Detection (Cisco Talos)—This policy   places all emphasis on security. Network connectivity and throughput   is not guaranteed and false positives are likely. This policy should   only be used for high security areas and security monitors must be   prepared to investigate alerts to determine their validity. * Security Over Connectivity (Cisco Talos)—This   policy places an emphasis on security, at the possible expense of   network connectivity and throughput. Traffic is inspected more   deeply, more rules are evaluated, and both false positives and   increased latency are expected but within reason. * Balanced Security and Connectivity (Cisco   Talos)—(Default.) This policy attempts to strike the   delicate balance between network connectivity and throughput and the   needs of security. While not as strict as Security Over   Connectivity, this policy attempts to keep users secure while being   less obtrusive about normal traffic. * Connectivity Over Security (Cisco Talos)—This   policy places an emphasis on network connectivity and throughput, at   the possible expense of security. Traffic is inspected less deeply,   and fewer rules are evaluated. * No Rules Active (Cisco Talos)—This policy is a   basic policy that configures typical preprocessor settings but does   not have any rules or built-in alerts enabled. Use this policy as a   base if you want to ensure that only those policies you want to   apply are enabled. |
| **Step 6** | Click OK.  You are returned to the intrusion policy list. You can now view the new policy and adjust rule actions as needed. |

---

### Viewing or Editing Intrusion Policy Properties (Snort 3)

The Intrusion Policy page shows a list of the policies, including both pre-defined
and user-defined policies, and their descriptions. To edit a policy, you must first
view the policy's properties.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for a policy.  The policy contains the following sections:   * Policy Name drop-down list.    + You can easily switch to a different policy by selecting it     from the drop-down list, or return to the list of policies     by clicking the back button (Go Back to Virtual Routers arrow.).   + You can delete this policy by clicking the delete icon next     to the policy name (delete icon). * General properties. This section shows the   intrusion mode, base policy, and description. Click   Edit to change these properties or the   policy name. * Rule Group table of contents. This list   displays all the rule groups that have active rules in the policy.   The groups have a hierarchy, with parent groups containing child   groups that organize subsets of rules within the larger parent   group. Each group is a logical collection of rules, and a given rule   can appear in more than one group.    + To add a group that currently has no active rules in the     policy, click + and select the group. See [Adding or Removing Rule Groups in an Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)](#Cisco_Task_in_List_GUI.dita_2d4f4706-b442-4ed1-8d9f-73abb005f21a).   + To change the security level of a group, select the child     group in the list. The rule list changes to show the     security level at the top, with the rules in the group     listed below. Click the Edit link     next to the security level and select a new level. Click     View Description when editing to     get information about each security level. Note that     changing the level can change which rules are active, and     also the action for a given rule, with more secure levels     tending to have more active rules and more rules with the     Drop action. Click OK to confirm the     change.      Changing the security level for an existing rule group.   + To remove all the rules in a group, select the child group in     the list. Then, click the Exclude     link to the far right of the group name and confirm that you     want to exclude the group. Excluding the group simply     disables all the rules in the group. It does not delete the     group.  However, if the group includes rules that are shared with     other groups that are enabled, the shared rules retain     whatever actions are applied by the still-active group. In     all cases, we retain your most aggressive setting for an     individual rule, regardless of group membership. * List of rules. You can use the search field to   help you find rules using full-text search. You can also select   filtering items to search on any combination of GID or SID, or   simply show rules based on their actions (disabled, alert, drop).   The rules are lazy-loaded, so it will take quite a bit of time to   scroll through the entire unfiltered list. When filtering the list,   click the refresh button to reload the filtered view.    + To change the action for a rule, click the     Action cell for the rule and     select the new action, to Alert only,     to Block matching traffic, or to     Disable the rule. The default     action for each rule is indicated.   + To change the action for more than one rule at a time, click     the check box in the left column of the rules you want to     change, then select the new action from the     Action drop-down list above the     rules table. Click the check box in the GID:SID header to     select all the rules in the list. You can change up to 5000     rules at a time.   + To get more information about a rule, click the link in the     GID:SID cell. The link takes you     to Snort.org.   + To change the rules listed, you can click a child group from     the rule group table of contents (not a parent group). You     can return to the all-rules list by clicking ALL     RULES at the top of the rule group list.   + To change the sorting order, click the table header for a     column. The default sorting for the rules is overridden     rules first, then drop rules, then alert rules. |

### Adding or Removing Rule Groups in an Intrusion Policy (Snort 3)

Intrusion rules are organized in local groups. There is a hierarchy to the groups,
with parent groups containing related child groups. The rules themselves appear in
child groups only: parent groups are simply an organizational construct. A given
rule can appear in more than one group.

The easiest way to add or remove rules in an intrusion policy is to add or remove
groups. Because the rules in a group are logically related, it is highly likely that
you will want to use most if not all rules within a given group.

The following procedure explains how to add groups and change the group’s security
level.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the edit icon (edit icon) for the policy you want to change. |
| **Step 3** | (Adding groups.) If the group is not shown in the list of rule groups, click + and do the following:   1. Find the child group.     * A check mark next to a parent group name indicates that all      child groups in the parent group are already selected.    * A minus mark next to a parent group name indicates that one      or more child group has no enabled rules for this policy.      These are the groups you can add.    * A check mark next to a child group name indicates the group      is already selected. 2. Select the group you want to add (that is, check its check box). 3. (Optional.) Each group has a default security level depending    on the base policy used for the custom policy. If you want to change it,    click the security level icon, select a new level, and click    OK.  Level 1 is the least secure posture, emphasizing connectivity over    security, whereas level 4 is the most aggressive, providing maximum    security. You can click View Description to    see an explanation of each level as you select it.     Changing security level while adding a rule group. 4. Continue selecting (or deselecting) groups until you have made all of    your changes. 5. Click OK. |
| **Step 4** | (Removing groups.) If you want to disable all the rules within a group, you can use any of the following methods:   * Select the group, then click the Exclude link   to the far right of the group name, above the list of rules. * Use the method for adding a group, but instead, deselect the unwanted   group (that is, uncheck its check box), and click   OK. |

### Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 3)

Each intrusion policy has the same rules. The difference is the action taken for each
rule can be different from policy to policy.

By changing the rule action, you can disable rules that are giving you too many false
positives, or you can change whether the rule alerts on or drops matching traffic.
You can also enable disabled rules to alert or drop matching traffic.

The easiest method to change rule actions is to change the security level of a rule
group. When you change a group's security level, the action of the rules within the
group change. This can mean that some rules become enabled (or disabled), or the
action can change between alert and drop, based on the security posture you select.
However, you can change an individual rule action if that is what you need.

| **Note** | ---   The default action for a given rule is based on the overall selection of group and severity. Changing the severity of the group, or excluding the group, can change the default action for the rule.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Choose Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the view icon (View configuration button.) for the policy whose rule actions you want to change. |
| **Step 3** | (Recommended method.) Change the security level for a rule group.   1. Click the child rule group in the rule group list. 2. Above the list of rules, click Edit next to the    security level for the group.     Changing the security level for an existing rule group.        | **Note** | If you want to disable all the rules in the group, do not click Edit. Instead, click Exclude and confirm that you want to exclude the group. The group is not deleted, its rules are simply disabled. Skip the remaining steps. |    | --- | --- | 3. Select the new level for the group. Click View    Description to see an explanation of each level as you    pick it.  Level 1 is the least secure posture, emphasizing connectivity over    security, whereas level 4 is the most aggressive, providing maximum    security. 4. Click OK. |
| **Step 4** | (Manual method.) Change the action for one or more rule.   1. Find the rule whose action you want to change.  Use the Search/Filter box to search on strings    within the rule information. You can also select filtering items to    search on any combination of GID or SID, or simply show rules based    on their actions (disabled, alert, drop). The rules are lazy-loaded,    so it will take quite a bit of time to scroll through the entire    unfiltered list. When filtering the list, click the refresh button    to reload the filtered view.  Ideally, you can get the Snort identifier (SID) and generator    identifier (GID) from an event or from Cisco Technical Support, if    you are working with them on an issue. You can then search precisely    for the rule. 2. To change the action, do one of the following:     * Change one rule at a time—Click the      Action column for the rule and      select the required action:       + Alert—Create an event when        this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the        connection.      + Drop—Create an event when this        rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection.      + Disabled—Do not match traffic        against this rule. No events are generated.    * Change multiple rules at one time—Click the check boxes for      the rules you want to change, then click the      Bulk drop-down above the table      and pick the desired action. Click the check box in the      GID:SID header to select all the rules in the list. You can      change up to 5000 rules at a time. |

---

## Managing Intrusion Policies (Snort 2)

You can apply any of the pre-defined intrusion policies. Each of these policies includes the same
list of intrusion rules (also known as signatures), but they differ in the actions taken
for each rule. For example, a rule might be active in one policy, but disabled in
another policy.

If you find that a
particular rule is giving you too many false positives, where the rule is
blocking traffic that you do not want blocked, you can disable the rule without
needing to switch to a less-secure intrusion policy. You could alternatively
change it to alert on matches without dropping traffic.

Conversely, if you know you need to protect against a specific attack, but the related rule is disabled in your chosen intrusion
policy, you can enable the rule without changing to a more secure policy.

Use the intrusion
related dashboards, and the Event Viewer (both on the
Monitoring page), to evaluate how intrusion rules
are impacting traffic. Keep in mind that you will see intrusion events and
intrusion data only for traffic that matches intrusion rules set to alert or
drop; disabled rules are not evaluated.

The following topics
explain intrusion policies and rule tuning in more detail.

* [Configure the Inspection Mode for an Intrusion Policy (Snort 2)](#id_121662)
* [Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)](#task_4D5DD40DDCE0426C8846E5684287E63B)

### Configure the Inspection Mode for an Intrusion Policy (Snort 2)

By default, all intrusion policies operate in Prevention mode to implement an Intrusion Prevention System (IPS). In the Prevention
inspection mode, if a connection matches an intrusion rule whose action is to drop traffic, the connection is actively blocked.

If you instead want to test the effect of the intrusion policy on your network, you can change the mode to Detection, which
implements an Intrusion Detection System (IDS). In this inspection mode, drop rules are treat like alert rules, where you
are notified of matching connections, but the action result becomes Would Have Blocked, and connections are never in fact
blocked.

You change the inspection mode per intrusion policy, so you can have a mix of prevention and detection.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the tab for the intrusion policy whose inspection mode you want to change.  The Inspection Mode is indicated above the rules table. |
| **Step 3** | Click the Edit link next to the inspection mode, change the mode for the policy, and click OK.  The options are:   * Prevention—Intrusion rule actions are always applied. Connections that match a drop rule are blocked. * Detection—Intrusion rules generate alerts only. A connection that matches a drop rule will generate alert messages, but the connection   will not be blocked. |

---

### Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 2)

Each pre-defined
intrusion policy has the same rules. The difference is the action taken for
each rule can be different from policy to policy.

By changing the rule action, you can disable rules that are giving you too many false positives, or you can change whether
the rule alerts on or drops matching traffic. You can also enable disabled rules to alert or drop matching traffic.

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Select Policies > Intrusion. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Click the tab for the intrusion policy whose rule actions you want to change.  The pre-defined policies are:   * Connectivity   over Security * Balanced   Security and Connectivity * Security   over Connectivity * Maximum   Detection |
| **Step 3** | Find the rule whose action you want to change.  The rules are sorted with the overridden ones listed first, and sorted by action within the group of overridden rules. Otherwise, the rules are sorted by GID, then SID.  Use the search box to locate the rule you want to change. Ideally, you can get the Snort identifier (SID) and generator identifier (GID) from an event or from Cisco Technical Support, if you are working with them on an issue.  For detailed information about the elements of each rule, see [Intrusion Rule Attributes](#concept_C4C21B1BDF794F468738C9F836C6C87B).  To search the list:   1. Click in the    Search box to open the search attributes dialog box. 2. Enter a    combination of Generator ID (GID), Snort ID (SID), or rule    Action, and click    Search.  For example,    you could select    Action = Drop to see all the rules in the policy    that will drop matching connections. The text beside the search box indicates    how many rules match your criteria, for example, “8937 of 9416 rules found.”  To clear a    search criteria, click the x for the criteria in the search box. |
| **Step 4** | Click the Action column for the rule and select the required action:   * Alert—Create an   event when this rule matches traffic, but do not drop the connection. * Drop—Create an   event when this rule matches traffic, and also drop the connection. * Disabled—Do not   match traffic against this rule. No events are generated.   The default action for the rule is indicated by “(Default)” added to the action. If you change the default, the status column indicates “Overridden” for that rule. |

## Monitoring Intrusion Policies

You can find intrusion
policy statistics on the
Attackers and
Targets dashboards on the
Monitoring page. You must apply an intrusion policy
to at least one access control rule to see any information on these dashboards.
See
[Monitoring Traffic and System Dashboards](fptd-fdm-monitor.html#id_10212).

To see intrusion
events, select
Monitoring > Events, then click the
Intrusion tab. You can hover over an event and
click the
View Details link to get more information. From
the details page, you can click the
View IPS Rule to go to the rule in the relevant
intrusion policy, where you can change the rule action. This can help you
reduce the impact of false positives, where a rule is blocking too many good
connections, by changing the action from drop to alert. Conversely, you can
change an alert rule into a drop rule if you are seeing a lot of attack traffic
for a rule.

If you configure a syslog server for the intrusion policy, intrusion events have the message ID 430001.

## Examples for Intrusion Policies

The use case chapter
includes the following examples of implementing intrusion policies.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

"text": "While this workaround has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.\r\n Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0\r\nFor Cisco FTD Software Release 6.7.0, as a workaround when the Snort 3 configuration option is enabled, an administrator may enable built-in rule 129:2 in the intrusion policy and set the action to Drop instead of Alert.\r\n\r\nUse the following steps to verify that the Snort 3 configuration option is enabled. For more details, see the Switching Between Snort 2 and Snort 3 [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/670/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-670/fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#id\_120089\"] section of the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager, Version 6.7.\r\n\r\nLog in to the Admin Portal for the FTD deployment.\r\nNavigate to Policies > Intrusion.\r\nLook for the Snort Version line above the table. The current version is the first number in the complete version number. For example, 2.9.17-95 is a Snort 2 version.\r\n\r\nUse the following steps to enable rule 129:2. For more details, see the Changing Intrusion Rule Actions (Snort 3) [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/firepower/670/fdm/fptd-fdm-config-guide-670/fptd-fdm-intrusion.html#Cisco\_Task\_in\_List\_GUI.dita\_54aef253-02ab-4044-88ea-cea05249686d\"] section of the Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Configuration Guide for Firepower Device Manager, Version 6.7.\r\n\r\nLog in to the Admin Portal for the FTD deployment.\r\nNavigate to Policies > Intrusion.\r\nChoose any system-provided policy, such as Balanced Security and Connectivity.\r\nSearch for rule 129:2.\r\nCheck the check box next to the rule to enable it.\r\nChoose Drop from the Action drop-down list.\r\nAdd the intrusion policy to a rule in Access control policy."

The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the HTTP payload if it is contained at least partially within the TFO connection handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TFO packets with an HTTP payload through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to bypass configured file policy for HTTP packets and deliver a malicious payload.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

The vulnerability is due to incorrect detection of the HTTP payload if it is contained at least partially within the TFO connection handshake. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted TFO packets with an HTTP payload through an affected device.

What is Snort?

Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules
that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and
generates alerts for users.

Snort can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well. Snort has three primary uses:
As a packet sniffer like tcpdump, as a packet logger — which is useful for network traffic debugging, or it can be
used as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system. Snort can be downloaded and configured for personal
and business use alike.

What are my options for buying and using Snort?

Once downloaded and configured, Snort rules are distributed in two sets: The “Community Ruleset” and the “Snort Subscriber Ruleset.”

The Snort Subscriber Ruleset is developed, tested, and approved by Cisco Talos. Subscribers to the Snort Subscriber Ruleset will receive the
ruleset in real-time as they are released to Cisco customers. You can download the rules and deploy them in your network through the Snort.org website. The Community Ruleset is developed by the Snort community and QAed by Cisco Talos. It is freely available to all users.

For more information about Snort Subscriber Rulesets available for purchase, please visit the [Snort product page](/products).
