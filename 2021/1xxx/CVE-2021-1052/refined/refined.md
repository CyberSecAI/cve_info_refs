Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver.
- Specifically, it is located within the handler for DxgkDdiEscape or IOCTL.
- User-mode clients can access legacy privileged APIs due to a lack of proper access controls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control
- Exposure of legacy privileged APIs to user-mode clients
- Allows access to privileged operations/data from lower privilege levels.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS)
- Escalation of Privileges: Attacker can gain higher privileges on the system
- Information Disclosure: Attacker can potentially access sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: An attacker must have local access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local user account with the ability to execute code in user mode.
- No user interaction is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects both Windows and Linux operating systems
- The affected drivers are:
  - NVIDIA GPU Display Driver
  - NVIDIA vGPU software (guest driver)
- The document also provides a list of specific driver versions that are affected.
