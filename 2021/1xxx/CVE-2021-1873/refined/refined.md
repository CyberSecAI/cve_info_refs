**Vulnerability:** CVE-2021-1873

**Affected Component:** WindowServer

**Affected Systems:** macOS Big Sur, macOS Mojave, macOS Catalina

**Root Cause:** An API issue in Accessibility TCC (Transparency, Consent, and Control) permissions.

**Weakness:** The vulnerability stems from an API issue in how WindowServer handles Accessibility TCC permissions. This suggests a flaw in the logic or state management related to these permissions.

**Impact:** A malicious application could unexpectedly leak a user's credentials from secure text fields. This means that a malicious app, possibly one with Accessibility permissions, could access and potentially steal sensitive information like passwords or credit card details that a user enters into secure text fields.

**Attack Vector:** A malicious application that is able to leverage the flaw in accessibility permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target system.
- The malicious application needs to be able to interact with the WindowServer.
- The application may need to have some form of access or permissions related to accessibility.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was addressed with improved state management related to API and TCC permissions.
- The issue affects multiple macOS versions (Big Sur, Mojave, Catalina).
