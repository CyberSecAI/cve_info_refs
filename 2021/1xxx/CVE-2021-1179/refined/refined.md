    "summary": "The provided documents detail multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers, including CVE-2021-1179. There are vulnerabilities in both the UPnP service and the web-based management interface that can lead to remote code execution or denial-of-service. The advisory states that no software updates will be released, as these products are EOL.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The root cause of CVE-2021-1179 and others is due to improper input validation. For the UPnP service, it is due to improper validation of incoming UPnP traffic. For the web-based management interface, it is due to improper validation of user-supplied input.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input validation of incoming UPnP traffic.",
        "Improper input validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface."
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code as root on the underlying operating system, or cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector for the UPnP vulnerability is through sending crafted UPnP requests to an affected device. For the web-based interface, the attack vector is through sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected device.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "For the UPnP vulnerability, an unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit it. For the web-based management interface vulnerabilities, the attacker needs valid administrator credentials on the affected device and must be either on the local LAN or have remote management enabled on the WAN interface."
