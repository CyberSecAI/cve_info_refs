Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1002:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly references **CVE-2021-1002** and includes details about a fix related to a buffer overflow in the `sonivox` component. This confirms the content's relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **global buffer overflow** in the `WT_Interpolate` function within the `sonivox` library.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The code has a flaw that allows writing data beyond the allocated buffer. This can lead to memory corruption.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure (ID):** While the provided information doesn't explicitly state the impact, a buffer overflow could potentially be leveraged to disclose sensitive information by overwriting data in memory.
*   **Code Execution:** Though not explicitly stated, buffer overflows are a common vulnerability that can be exploited to achieve code execution.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves processing specially crafted media data that triggers the vulnerable `WT_Interpolate` function in the `sonivox` library, causing a buffer overflow.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker would likely need the ability to provide or manipulate media input to trigger the vulnerability. This could potentially be done through a malicious application or by tricking a user into playing the crafted media file.
