- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vGPU can cause resource starvation among other vGPUs hosted on the same GPU.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Resource starvation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service.
- **Attack vectors:**  Local access within a vGPU environment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker with local unprivileged system access within a vGPU guest can cause resource starvation.
