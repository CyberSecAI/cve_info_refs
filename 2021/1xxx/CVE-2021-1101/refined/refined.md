Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-1101:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA vGPU software's Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin), where a NULL pointer can be dereferenced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: The code attempts to access memory through a pointer that is NULL (pointing to address 0). This is an invalid memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Dereferencing a NULL pointer typically causes a program to crash or terminate unexpectedly, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have access to the system where the vulnerable software is running.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local access is required
- The attacker must have the ability to interact with the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin) in a way that triggers the null pointer dereference. User privileges are low, but it has to be a user on the hypervisor/host, who has the rights to interact with the vGPU plugin.

**Additional Notes:**

*   This vulnerability affects the Virtual GPU Manager component of the NVIDIA vGPU software and not the display driver directly.
*   The provided CVSS vector string is `AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`.
    *   **AV:L** (Attack Vector: Local)
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   **PR:L** (Privileges Required: Low)
    *   **UI:N** (User Interaction: None)
    *   **S:U** (Scope: Unchanged)
    *   **C:N** (Confidentiality: None)
    *   **I:N** (Integrity: None)
    *   **A:H** (Availability: High)
*   The advisory also indicates that this vulnerability is addressed in vGPU software version 12.3, 11.5 and 8.8
