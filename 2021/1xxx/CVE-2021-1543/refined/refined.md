  "description": "A vulnerability in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business 220 Series Smart Switches could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to conduct a cross-site scripting (XSS) attack.\n\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of user-supplied input by the web-based management interface of the affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by persuading a user to click a malicious link and access a specific page. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface or access sensitive, browser-based information and redirect the user to an arbitrary page.",
