Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-1558:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   Insufficient restrictions during the execution of certain CLI commands within the Cisco DNA Spaces Connector.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The primary issue is that the affected CLI commands do not have adequate restrictions, allowing an authenticated user to execute commands with elevated privileges.
*   **Command Injection:** The lack of proper input sanitization when running CLI commands allows for the execution of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Privilege Escalation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to elevate their privileges from `dnasadmin` to `root` on the underlying operating system.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** With root access, an attacker can execute any arbitrary command on the affected system, leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** An attacker with root access can potentially access sensitive information, modify system configurations, and disrupt service availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the affected system. This implies the attacker already has some level of authorized access.
*   **CLI Commands:** The vulnerabilities are exploited by leveraging insufficient restrictions when executing specific CLI commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the system with at least `dnasadmin` level privileges.
*   **Local System Access:** The attacker needs to have direct or local access to the system.
*   **CLI Access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute CLI commands.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco DNA Spaces Connector releases earlier than 2.3.1.
*   There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   The fix is available in Cisco DNA Spaces Connector release 2.3.1 and later.
*   CWE-78 is associated with this vulnerability, which refers to OS Command Injection.
*   The vulnerability was discovered through internal security testing by the Cisco Advanced Security Initiatives Group (ASIG).
*   The CVSS base score is 6.0 with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:N`
