Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1011:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an issue in the `PackageInstallerService` within the Android framework. Specifically, the vulnerability is related to how permissions and owner rights are enforced during the handling of package installations. The code was not performing checks for the validity of certain conditions early enough in the process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-   **Information Disclosure (ID):** The commit messages and the security bulletin mention that the issue is an information disclosure vulnerability. While the specific details are not entirely clear, the commit message for the fix states: "Combining the two IllegalArgumentException check in getSigningKeySet to mitigate the potential information leakage". This suggests the vulnerability could allow an attacker to potentially glean sensitive information about installed packages through improper handling of exceptions or checks related to signing keys.
-   **Improper Permission/Owner Rights Enforcement:** The fix involves moving permission and owner rights checks to an earlier stage of the method. This implies that the vulnerability likely arose from checks being performed too late, possibly allowing operations to be initiated without proper authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information about installed packages through improper handling of exceptions or checks related to signing keys.
-   It's possible the vulnerability could be leveraged to bypass or circumvent expected security measures, although the specific impact is not fully detailed here.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   The specific attack vector isn't described in detail. However, given that it involves `PackageInstallerService` and the `getSigningKeySet` method, it's likely that an attacker would exploit this vulnerability through malicious or crafted installation requests targeting specific package management APIs, potentially by providing crafted or invalid arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   An attacker would need to be able to interact with the Android package installation APIs, potentially through a malicious application or some form of system interaction. The specific user position is not outlined here, but it is reasonable to assume that this attack could be executed by a local user, though the content does not preclude more remote vectors.
-   The attacker would need to craft specific calls to exploit the vulnerability by triggering the insecure error handling paths.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided commit message indicates that the fix involves combining two `IllegalArgumentException` checks into a single check. This suggests that the vulnerability may have been caused by multiple separate checks failing in ways that could potentially leak information.
- The fix specifically addresses a potential information leakage through the `getSigningKeySet` method in `PackageInstallerService`.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.

In summary, CVE-2021-1011 was an information disclosure vulnerability related to how `PackageInstallerService` handled permission and owner rights and signing key related exceptions during package installation. The fix involved enforcing these checks earlier in the process to prevent potential information leakage.
