Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1614:

**1. Verification:**

The content directly references CVE-2021-1614, and the description in the provided advisory matches the official CVE description.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the Multiprotocol Label Switching (MPLS) packet handling function of Cisco SD-WAN Software.
- The root cause is insufficient handling of malformed MPLS packets. Specifically, the software does not properly validate or sanitize these packets before processing them.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The software fails to properly validate or sanitize MPLS packets, leading to the possibility of processing malformed packets.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially access sensitive information stored in MPLS buffer memory.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated remote attacker to gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored in the MPLS buffer memory of affected devices.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-based Attack:** The attacker sends a crafted, malformed MPLS packet to a vulnerable device.
- **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker does not need local access to the device.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device.
- **Crafted MPLS Packet:** The attacker must be able to generate a malformed MPLS packet that will trigger the vulnerability.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.
