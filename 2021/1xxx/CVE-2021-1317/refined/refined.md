    "summary": "Multiple command injection vulnerabilities exist in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers. These vulnerabilities could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges. The root cause is improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending crafted HTTP requests to a targeted device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the *root* user on the underlying operating system. To exploit these vulnerabilities, an attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on an affected device."
