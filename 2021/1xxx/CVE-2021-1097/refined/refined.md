- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The NVIDIA vGPU software's Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin) improperly validates the length field in a request from a guest.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper input validation, specifically the length field of a guest request.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Information disclosure, data tampering, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious guest sending a request with a length field inconsistent with the actual input length.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a malicious guest within the virtualized environment.
