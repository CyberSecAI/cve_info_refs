  "CVE_data": {
    "id": "CVE-2021-1623",
    "Description": "A vulnerability in the Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP) punt handling function of Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to overload a device punt path, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "Root cause": "The punt path is overwhelmed by large quantities of SNMP requests.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "The device is unable to properly handle a large number of SNMP requests.",
      "The default rate for SNMP punt is too high."
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to overload the device punt path, resulting in a DoS condition.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending a large number of SNMP requests to an affected device via IPv4 or IPv6."
    ],
    "Required capabilities": "The attacker must be authenticated and able to send SNMP requests. The vulnerability applies to SNMP requests that have valid SNMP community strings or credentials, depending on the SNMP version.",
     "Additional Information": "The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case. With the fix a new SNMP-specific punt-cause has been introduced and can be tuned using the platform punt-policer command. The default rate is 512 packets per second."
