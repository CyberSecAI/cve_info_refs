Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-1481:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to **insufficient input validation** in the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software. This lack of proper validation allows for Cypher query language injection attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cypher Query Language Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject malicious Cypher queries, which are used to interact with the database.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The web-based management interface fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input, allowing for the injection attack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to obtain sensitive information from the affected system's database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Authenticated Attack:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of the affected system. Authentication to the interface is required for exploitation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to reach the vManage web interface.
*   **Valid Credentials:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to authenticate to the vManage web-based management interface.
*   **HTTP Request Manipulation:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send malicious HTTP requests to the affected system.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software releases prior to Release 20.5.1 are affected.
*   **Fixed Software:** The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software releases 20.5.1 and later.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability; upgrading is necessary.
*   **CVSS Score:**  The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 4.3 (Medium Severity), with a vector string of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-943 (Improper Neutralization of Special Elements in Data Query Logic).
*   **Acknowledgement:** The vulnerability was reported by Julien Legras and Th√©o Louis-Tisserand of Synacktiv.
