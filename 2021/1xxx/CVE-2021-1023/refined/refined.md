CVE-2021-1023:
  - Root cause of vulnerability: An application can query which applications are installed on the device without requiring the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission. This is possible via the `getDeviceIdWithFeature`, `getMeidForSlot`, and `getNetworkTypeForSubscriber` methods of `PhoneInterfaceManager`.
  - Weaknesses/vulnerabilities: Information disclosure vulnerability.
  - Impact of exploitation: An attacker can gather information about installed applications on a device. This could be used for targeted attacks or to gather data about the device user's behavior.
  - Attack vectors: A malicious application installed on the device can call the vulnerable methods.
  - Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to have an app installed on the device.
