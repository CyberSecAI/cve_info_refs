Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1772:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A stack overflow vulnerability exists within the parsing of TrueType Format (TTF) fonts in Apple's CoreText library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: A crafted TTF font can cause a stack-based buffer to overflow during parsing.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to execute code within the context of the current process. This could lead to unauthorized access to data, system compromise, and other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted text file: Processing a malicious TTF font file can trigger the vulnerability. The specific attack vector can vary based on how the CoreText library is implemented and interacted with. This could include opening the file directly or rendering it within a web browser or other application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to cause the vulnerable application or service to process the crafted TTF font. This could involve a remote attack by sending the font data via a network or local attack where the attacker has the ability to get the font file onto the target system. User interaction is required for successful exploitation, such as opening a file containing the crafted font or visiting a website rendering it.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Mickey Jin (@patch1t) of Trend Micro.
- The vulnerability was addressed in macOS Big Sur 11.2, Security Update 2021-001 Catalina, Security Update 2021-001 Mojave, watchOS 7.3, iOS 14.4, iPadOS 14.4, and tvOS 14.4.
- Apple has issued updates to correct this vulnerability.

This vulnerability is present across multiple Apple products due to the shared use of the CoreText library.
