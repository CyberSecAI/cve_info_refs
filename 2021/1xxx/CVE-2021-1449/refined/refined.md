{
  "CVE-2021-1449": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability in the boot logic of Cisco Access Points Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to execute unsigned code at boot time.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to an improper check that is performed by the area of code that manages system startup processes.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper check in system startup process",
       "Bypass of software image verification check",
      "Lack of access control to development shell (devshell)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute unsigned code at boot time, bypassing the software image verification check of the secure boot process.",
    "Attack vector": "Local access to the device is required, with the attacker needing access to the development shell (devshell).",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An authenticated, local attacker with access to the development shell (devshell) on the affected device."
