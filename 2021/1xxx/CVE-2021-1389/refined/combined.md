| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XR and Cisco NX-OS Software IPv6 Access Control List Bypass Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-ipv6-acl-CHgdYk8j  First Published: 2021 February 3 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvm55638](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvm55638)  [CSCvv45698](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv45698)     CVE-2021-1389     CWE-284       CVSS Score: [Base 5.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2021-1389     CWE-284       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipv6-acl-CHgdYk8j/csaf/cisco-sa-ipv6-acl-CHgdYk8j.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the IPv6 traffic processing of Cisco IOS XR Software and Cisco NX-OS Software for certain Cisco devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass an IPv6 access control list (ACL) that is configured for an interface of an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to improper processing of IPv6 traffic that is sent through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv6 packets that traverse the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access resources that would typically be protected by the interface ACL.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipv6-acl-CHgdYk8j>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco devices if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software and had IPv6 ACL configured:    + Network Convergence System (NCS) 540 Series Routers   + NCS 560 Series Routers   + NCS 5500 Series   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Switching Platforms For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine the Configuration for Cisco IOS XR Software**  Use the **show running-config | include ipv6 access-list** command to view the configured ACLs for IPv6. If this command produces an output, the device should be considered vulnerable. The following example shows the output on a device that has the IPv6 ACL configured:  ```   Router# show running-config  | include ipv6 access-listipv6 access-list    ```  This does not apply to IPv4 ACLs.  **Determine the Configuration for Cisco NX-OS Software**  Use the **show ipv6 access-lists** command to view the configured ACLs for IPv6. If this command produces an output, the device should be considered vulnerable. The following example shows the output on a device that has the IPv6 ACL configured:  ```   Nexus# show ipv6 access-lists   IPv6 access list    ```  This does not apply to IPv4 ACLs. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + NCS 520 Series Routers   + NCS 5000 Series Switches   + NCS 6000 Series Routers   + IOS XR SW-only   + IOS XRv 9000 Routers   + ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers   + Carrier Routing System (CRS)   + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * **Cisco IOS XR Software**  After being upgraded to a fixed release of Cisco IOS XR Software, the device is able to detect IPv6 packets that may be improperly processed. Once detected, the device sends these packets to the main CPU for further processing. This activity may result in reduced performance in forwarding IPv6 packets that match specific network traffic patterns.  If the device is not configured to perform IPv6 packets classification, administrators can disable the CPU-based inspection for IPv6 packets. The feature can be disabled by using the CLI command **hw-module profile acl ipv6 ext-header permit** in global configuration mode. Customers should be aware that this action will expose the device to the vulnerability that is described in the advisory, even if the device is running a fixed Cisco IOS XR Software release.  The vulnerability described in this advisory only applies to IPv6 packets that traverse an affected device. It does not apply to IPv4 traffic or to IPv6 traffic that is destined for an affected device.  **Cisco NX-OS Software**  To protect a device from this vulnerability, administrators must install a fixed release of Cisco NX-OS Software and apply the rule **extension-header deny-all** to any IPv6 ACL that is configured on the device. A device should be considered vulnerable until the rule **extension-header deny-all** has been applied to all IPv6 ACLs that are configured on the device, even if it is running a fixed Cisco NX-OS Software release.  Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(7), Cisco Nexus 3600 Platform Switches and Cisco Nexus 9500 R-Series Switching Platforms include the rule **extension-header {permit-all | deny-all}** for the disposition of IPv6 packets that include extension headers. The rule is not enabled by default. With the rule **extension-header deny-all** configured, the device will drop any IPv6 packet with at least one extension header, regardless of any other IPv6 ACL rules that match other fields of the packet.  If the rule **extension-header permit-all** is configured, then the device is vulnerable.  For detailed information about configuring **extension-header {permit-all | deny-all}**, see the [Cisco Nexus 3600 NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3600/sw/93x/unicast/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_010010.html) or the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/unicast/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-series-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x.html).  For detailed information about configuring ACLs, see the [Cisco Nexus 3600 NX-OS Security Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3600/sw/93x/security/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_01.html) or the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/security/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide_7x.html).  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases **Cisco IOS XR Software**  At the time of publication, Cisco IOS XR Software releases 6.6.3, 6.7.1, 7.1.1, 7.2.1, and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.  See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  **Cisco NX-OS Software**  After upgrading a device to a fixed release of Cisco NX-OS Software, customers must apply the rule **extension-header deny-all** to any IPv6 ACL that is configured on the device. The rule is not enabled by default. A device should be considered vulnerable until the rule **extension-header deny-all** has been applied to all IPv6 ACLs that are configured on the device, even if it is running a fixed Cisco NX-OS Software release.  For detailed information about configuring the **extension-header deny-all** rule, see the [Cisco Nexus 3600 NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3600/sw/93x/unicast/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_010010.html) or the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/unicast/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-series-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x.html).  To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release-for example, **7.0(3)I7(5)** for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or **14.0(1h)** for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:    Cisco NX-OS Software   Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode   MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   Nexus 1000V Series Switches   Nexus 3000 Series Switches   Nexus 5000 Series Switches   Nexus 6000 Series Switches   Nexus 7000 Series Switches   Nexus 9000 Series Switches        By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

## Information About HSRP

HSRP is a first-hop redundancy protocol (FHRP) that allows a transparent failover of the first-hop IP router. HSRP provides
first-hop routing redundancy for IP hosts on Ethernet networks configured with a default router IP address. You use HSRP in
a group of routers for selecting an active router and a standby router. In a group of routers, the active router is the router
that routes packets; the standby router is the router that takes over when the active router fails or when preset conditions
are met.

Many host implementations do not support any dynamic router discovery mechanisms but can be configured with a default router.
Running a dynamic router discovery mechanism on every host is not feasible for a number of reasons, including administrative
overhead, processing overhead, and security issues. HSRP provides failover services to these hosts.

### HSRP Overview

When you use HSRP, you configure the HSRP virtual IP address as the host’s default router (instead of the IP address of the
actual router). The virtual IP address is an IPv4address that is shared among a group of routers that run HSRP.

When you configure HSRP on a network segment, you provide a virtual MAC address and a virtual IP address for the HSRP group.
You configure the same virtual address on each HSRP-enabled interface in the group. You also configure a unique IP address
and MAC address on each interface that acts as the real address. HSRP selects one of these interfaces to be the active router.
The active router receives and routes packets destined for the virtual MAC address of the group.

HSRP detects when the designated active router fails. At that point, a selected standby router assumes control of the virtual
MAC and IP addresses of the HSRP group. HSRP also selects a new standby router at that time.

HSRP uses a priority mechanism to determine which HSRP-configured interface becomes the default active router. To configure
an interface as the active router, you assign it with a priority that is higher than the priority of all the other HSRP-configured
interfaces in the group. The default priority is 100, so if you configure just one interface with a higher priority, that
interface becomes the default active router.

Interfaces that run HSRP send and receive multicast User Datagram Protocol (UDP)-based hello messages to detect a failure
and to designate active and standby routers. When the active router fails to send a hello message within a configurable period
of time, the standby router with the highest priority becomes the active router. The transition of packet forwarding functions
between the active and standby router is completely transparent to all hosts on the network.

You can configure multiple HSRP groups on an interface.

The following figure shows a network configured for HSRP. By sharing a virtual MAC address and a virtual IP address, two or
more interfaces can act as a single virtual router.

Figure 1. HSRP Topology with Two Enabled Routers

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/180001-190000/185001-186000/185061.eps/_jcr_content/renditions/185061.jpg)

The virtual router does not physically exist but represents the common default router for interfaces that are configured to
provide backup to each other. You do not need to configure the hosts on the LAN with the IP address of the active router.
Instead, you configure them with the IP address (virtual IP address) of the virtual router as their default router. If the
active router fails to send a hello message within the configurable period of time, the standby router takes over, responds
to the virtual addresses, and becomes the active router, assuming the active router duties. From the host perspective, the
virtual router remains the same.

| **Note** | ---   Packets received on a routed port destined for the HSRP virtual IP address will terminate on the local router, regardless of whether that router is the active HSRP router or the standby HSRP router. This includes ping and Telnet traffic. Packets received on a Layer 2 (VLAN) interface destined for the HSRP virtual IP address will terminate on the active router.   --- |

### HSRP for IPv4

HSRP routers communicate with each other by exchanging HSRP hello packets. These packets are sent to the destination IP multicast
address 224.0.0.2 (reserved multicast address used to communicate to all routers) on UDP port 1985. The active router sources
hello packets from its configured IP address and the HSRP virtual MAC address while the standby router sources hellos from
its configured IP address and the interface MAC address, which may or may not be the burned-in address (BIA). The BIA is the
last six bytes of the MAC address that is assigned by the manufacturer of the network interface card (NIC).

Because hosts are configured with their default router as the HSRP virtual IP address, hosts must communicate with the MAC
address associated with the HSRP virtual IP address. This MAC address is a virtual MAC address, 0000.0C07.ACxy, where xy is
the HSRP group number in hexadecimal based on the respective interface. For example, HSRP group 1 uses the HSRP virtual MAC
address of 0000.0C07.AC01. Hosts on the adjoining LAN segment use the normal Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) process to
resolve the associated MAC addresses.

HSRP version 2 uses the new IP multicast address 224.0.0.102 to send hello packets instead of the multicast address of 224.0.0.2,
which is used by version 1. HSRP version 2 permits an expanded group number range of 0 to 4095 and uses a new MAC address
range of 0000.0C9F.F000 to 0000.0C9F.FFFF.

### HSRP Versions

Cisco NX-OS supports HSRP version 1 by default. You can configure an interface to use HSRP version 2.

HSRP version 2 has the following enhancements to HSRP version 1:

* Expands the group number range. HSRP version 1 supports group numbers from 0 to 255. HSRP version 2 supports group numbers
  from 0 to 4095.
* For IPv4, uses the IPv4 multicast address 224.0.0.102to send hello packets instead of the multicast address of 224.0.0.2,
  which is used by HSRP version 1.
* Uses the MAC address range from 0000.0C9F.F000 to 0000.0C9F.FFFF. HSRP version 1 uses the MAC address range 0000.0C07.AC00
  to 0000.0C07.ACFF.
* Adds support for MD5 authentication.

When you change the HSRP version, Cisco NX-OS reinitializes the group because it now has a new virtual MAC address.

HSRP version 2 has a different packet format than HSRP version 1. The packet format uses a type-length-value (TLV) format.
HSRP version 2 packets received by an HSRP version 1 router are ignored.

### HSRP Subnet VIP

Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(3), you can configure an HSRP subnet virtual IP (VIP) address in a different subnet
than that of the interface IP address.

This feature enables you to conserve public IPv4 addresses by using a VIP as a public IP address and an interface IP as a
private IP address. HSRP subnet VIPs are not needed for IPv6 addresses because a larger pool of IPv6 addresses is available
and because routable IPv6 addresses can be configured on an SVI and used with regular HSRP.

This feature also enables periodic ARP synchronization to vPC peers and allows ARP to source with the VIP when an HSRP subnet
VIP is configured for hosts in the VIP subnet.

For more information, see [Guidelines and Limitations](#concept_um2_stn_bfb) and [Configuration Examples for HSRP](#concept_zs3_wgp_bfb).

### HSRP Authentication

HSRP message digest 5 (MD5) algorithm authentication protects against HSRP-spoofing software and uses the industry-standard
MD5 algorithm for improved reliability and security. HSRP includes the IPv4 address in the authentication TLVs.

### HSRP Messages

Routers that are configured with HSRP exchange the following three types of multicast messages:

* Hello—The hello message conveys the HSRP priority and state information of the router to other HSRP routers.
* Coup—When a standby router wants to assume the function of the active router, it sends a coup message.
* Resign—The active router sends this message when it no longer wants to function as the active router.

### HSRP Load Sharing

HSRP allows you to configure multiple groups on an interface. You can configure two overlapping IPv4 HSRP groups to load share
traffic from the connected hosts while providing the default router redundancy expected from HSRP. Figure below shows an example
of a load-sharing HSRP IPv4 configuration.

Figure 2. HSRP Load Sharing

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/180001-190000/185001-186000/185059.eps/_jcr_content/renditions/185059.jpg)

Figure **HSRP Load Sharing** shows two routers (A and B) and two HSRP groups. Router A is the active router for group A but is the standby router for
group B. Similarly, router B is the active router for group B and the standby router for group A. If both routers remain active,
HSRP load balances the traffic from the hosts across both routers. If either router fails, the remaining router continues
to process traffic for both hosts.

### Object Tracking and HSRP

You can use object tracking to modify the priority of an HSRP interface based on the operational state of another interface.
Object tracking allows you to route to a standby router if the interface to the main network fails.

Two objects that you can track are the line protocol state of an interface or the reachability of an IP route. If the specified
object goes down, Cisco NX-OS reduces the HSRP priority by the configured amount. For more information, see the [Configuring HSRP Object Tracking](#task_wlz_dgp_bfb) section.

### Virtualization Support

HSRP supports Virtual Routing and Forwarding instances (VRFs). By default, Cisco NX-OS places you in the default VRF unless
you specifically configure another VRF.

If you change the VRF membership of an interface, Cisco NX-OS removes all Layer 3 configuration, including HSRP.

For more information, see [Configuring Layer 3 Virtualization](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3600/sw/7x/unicast/configuration/guide/l3_nx-os/l3_virtual.html#76351)

## Prerequisites for HSRP

HSRP has the following prerequisites:

* You must enable the HSRP feature in a switch before you can configure and enable any HSRP groups.

## Guidelines and Limitations for HSRP

HSRP has the following configuration guidelines and limitations:

* The minimum hello timer value is 250 milliseconds.
* The minimum hold timer value is 750 milliseconds.
* You must configure an IP address for the interface that you configure HSRP on and enable that interface before HSRP becomes
  active.
* For IPv4, the virtual IP address must be in the same subnet as the interface IP address.
* We recommend that you do not configure more than one first-hop redundancy protocol on the same interface.
* HSRP version 2 does not interoperate with HSRP version 1. An interface cannot operate both version 1 and version 2 because
  both versions are mutually exclusive. However, the different versions can be run on different physical interfaces of the same
  router.
* You cannot change from version 2 to version 1 if you have configured groups above the group number range allowed for version
  1 (0 to 255).
* Cisco NX-OS removes all Layer 3 configuration on an interface when you change the interface VRF membership, port channel membership,
  or when you change the port mode to Layer 2.
* The HSRP subnet VIP feature, which is introduced in Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)F3(3), has the following guidelines and limitations:

  + – This feature is supported only for IPv4 addresses and only in a vPC topology.
  + – Primary or secondary VIPs can be subnet VIPs, but subnet VIPs must not overlap any interface subnet.
  + – Regular host VIPs use a mask length of 0 or 32. If you specify a mask length for a subnet VIP, it must be greater than 0
    and less than 32.
  + – uRPF is not supported with this feature.
  + – DHCP sourcing with VIPs is also not supported.
  + – This feature does not support using a DHCP relay agent to relay DHCP packets with a VIP as the source.
  + – VIP direct routes must be explicitly advertised to routing protocols using redistribute commands and route maps.
  + – Supervisor-generated traffic (pings, trace routes, and so on) destined for VIP subnets will continue to source with SVI
    IP addresses and not with the VIP.
  + – If the subnet VIP is configured with /32 as the prefix, you must use the no command with the /32 prefix to remove the IP
    address (for example, no ip ip-address/32).

## Default Settings for HSRP

Table below lists the default settings for HSRP parameters.

Table 1. Default HSRP Parameters

* [Customizing HSRP](#reference_o5d_mgp_bfb)

### Enabling the HSRP Feature

You must globally enable the HSRP feature before you can configure and enable any HSRP groups.

**DETAILED STEPS**

To enable the HSRP feature, use the following command in global configuration mode:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| feature hsrp  **Example** :  ``` switch(config)# feature hsrp ``` | Enables HSRP. |

To disable the HSRP feature and remove all associated configuration, use the following command in global configuration mode:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| no feature hsrp  **Example** :  ``` switch(config)# no feature hsrp ``` | Disables HSRP. |

### Configuring the HSRP Version

You can configure the HSRP version. If you change the version for existing groups, Cisco NX-OS reinitializes HSRP for those
groups because the virtual MAC address changes. The HSRP version applies to all groups on the interface.

To configure the HSRP version, use the following command in interface configuration mode:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| hsrp version { 1 | 2 }  **Example** :  ``` switch(config-if)# hsrp version 2 ``` | Configures the HSRP version. Version 1 is the default. |

### Configuring an HSRP Group for IPv4

You can configure an HSRP group on an IPv4 interface and configure the virtual IP address and virtual MAC address for the
HSRP group.

#### Before you begin

Ensure that you have enabled the HSRP feature (see the [Enabling the HSRP Feature](#reference_o1y_v5n_bfb) section).

Cisco NX-OS enables an HSRP group once you configure the virtual IP address on any member interface in the group. You should
configure HSRP attributes such as authentication, timers, and priority before you enable the HSRP group.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | interface type number  Example: ``` switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/2 switch(config-if)# ``` | Enters interface configuration mode. |
| **Step 3** | no switchport  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# no switchport ``` | Configures the interface as a Layer 3 routed interface. |
| **Step 4** | ip address ip-address/length  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# ip address 192.0.2.2/8 ``` | Configures the IPv4 address of the interface. |
| **Step 5** | hsrp group-number [ ipv4 ]  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# hsrp 2 switch(config-if-hsrp) ``` | Creates an HSRP group and enters hsrp configuration mode. The range for HSRP version 1 is from 0 to 255. The range is for HSRP version 2 is from 0 to 4095. The default value is 0. |
| **Step 6** | ip [ ip-address [ secondary ]]  Example: ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# ip 192.0.2.1 ``` | Configures the virtual IP address for the HSRP group and enables the group. This address should be in the same subnet as the IPv4 address of the interface. |
| **Step 7** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# exit ``` | Exits HSRP configuration mode. |
| **Step 8** | no shutdown  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# no shutdown ``` | Enables the interface. |
| **Step 9** | (Optional) show hsrp [ group group-number ] [ ipv4 ]  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# show hsrp group 2 ``` | (Optional)  Displays HSRP information. |
| **Step 10** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Saves this configuration change. |

#### Example

| **Note** | ---   You should use the no shutdown  command to enable the interface after you finish the configuration.   --- |
| --- | --- |

This example shows how to configure an HSRP group on Ethernet 1/2:

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/2
switch(config-if)# no switchport
switch(config-if)# ip 192.0.2.2/8
switch(config-if)# hsrp 2
switch(config-if-hsrp)# ip 192.0.2.1
switch(config-if-hsrp)# exit
switch(config-if)# no shutdown
switch(config-if)# copy running-config startup-config
```

### Configuring the HSRP Virtual MAC Address

You can override the default virtual MAC address that HSRP derives from the configured group number.

To manually configure the virtual MAC address for an HSRP group, use the following command in hsrp configuration mode:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| mac-address string  **Example** :  ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# mac-address 5000.1000.1060 ``` | Configures the virtual MAC address for an HSRP group. The string uses the standard MAC address format (xxxx.xxxx.xxxx). |

To configure HSRP to use the burned-in MAC address of the interface for the virtual MAC address, use the following command
in interface configuration mode:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| hsrp use-bia [ scope interface ]  **Example** :  ``` switch(config-if)# hsrp use-bia ``` | Configures HSRP to use the burned-in MAC address of the interface for the HSRP virtual MAC address. You can optionally configure HSRP to use the burned-in MAC address for all groups on this interface by using the scope interface  keywords. |

### Authenticating HSRP

You can configure HSRP to authenticate the protocol using cleartext or MD5 digest authentication. MD5 authentication uses
a key chain.

#### Before you begin

Ensure that you have enabled the HSRP feature (see the [Enabling the HSRP Feature](#reference_o1y_v5n_bfb) section).

You must configure the same authentication and keys on all members of the HSRP group.

Ensure that you have created the key chain if you are using MD5 authentication.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | interface interface type slot/port  Example: ``` switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/2 switch(config-if)# ``` | Enters interface configuration mode.. |
| **Step 3** | no switchport  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# no switchport ``` | Configures the interface as a Layer 3 routed interface. |
| **Step 4** | hsrp group-number [ ipv4 ]  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# hsrp 2 switch(config-if-hsrp) ``` | Creates an HSRP group and enters HSRP configuration mode. |
| **Step 5** | | Option | Description | | --- | --- | | Command | Purpose | | authentication text string  Example:  ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# authentication text mypassword ``` | Configures cleartext authentication for HSRP on this interface. | | authentication md5 { key-chain key-chain | key-string { 0 | 7 } text [ timeout seconds ]}  Example:  ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# authentication md5 key-chain hsrp-keys ``` | Configures MD5 authentication for HSRP on this interface. You can use a key chain or key string. If you use a key string, you can optionally set the timeout for when HSRP will only accept a new key. The range is from 0 to 32767 seconds. | |  |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) show hsrp [ group group-number ]  Example: ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# show hsrp group 2 ``` | (Optional)  Displays HSRP information. |
| **Step 7** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Saves this configuration change. |

#### Example

This example shows how to configure MD5 authentication for HSRP on Ethernet 1/2 after creating the key chain:

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# key chain hsrp-keys
switch(config-keychain)# key 0
switch(config-keychain-key)# key-string 7 zqdest
switch(config-keychain-key) accept-lifetime 00:00:00 Jun 01 2008 23:59:59 Sep 12 2008
switch(config-keychain-key) send-lifetime 00:00:00 Jun 01 2008 23:59:59 Aug 12 2008
switch(config-keychain-key) key 1
switch(config-keychain-key) key-string 7 uaeqdyito
switch(config-keychain-key) accept-lifetime 00:00:00 Aug 12 2008 23:59:59 Dec 12 2008
switch(config-keychain-key) send-lifetime 00:00:00 Sep 12 2008 23:59:59 Nov 12 2008
switch(config-keychain-key)# interface ethernet 1/2
switch(config-if)# no switchport
switch(config-if)# hsrp 2
switch(config-if-hsrp)# authenticate md5 key-chain hsrp-keys
switch(config-if-hsrp)# copy running-config startup-config
```

### Configuring HSRP Object Tracking

You can configure an HSRP group to adjust its priority based on the availability of other interfaces or routes. The priority
of a switch can change dynamically if it has been configured for object tracking and the object that is being tracked goes
down. The tracking process periodically polls the tracked objects and notes any value change. The value change triggers HSRP
to recalculate the priority. The HSRP interface with the higher priority becomes the active router if you configure the HSRP
interface for preemption.

HSRP supports tracked objects and track lists. See [Configuring Object Tracking](b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_010100.html#topic_r55_rby_bfb) for more information on track lists.

#### Before you begin

Ensure that you have enabled the HSRP feature (see the [Enabling the HSRP Feature](#reference_o1y_v5n_bfb) section).

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | | Option | Description | | --- | --- | | Command | Purpose | | track object-id interface interface-type number { ip routing | line-protocol }  Example:  ``` switch(config)# track 1 interface ethernet 2/2 line-protocol switch(config-track# ``` | Configures the interface that this HSRP interface tracks. Changes in the state of the interface affect the priority of this HSRP interface as follows:   * You configure the interface and corresponding object number that you use with the track  command in hsrp configuration mode. * The line-protocol  keyword tracks whether the interface is up. The ip  keyword also checks that IP routing is enabled on the interface and an IP address is configured. | | track object-id ip route ip-prefix/length reachability  Example:  ``` switch(config)# track 2 ip route 192.0.2.0/8 reachability switch(config-track# ``` | Creates a tracked object for a route and enters tracking configuration mode. The object-id  range is from 1 to 500. | |  |
| **Step 3** | interface interface-type slot/port  Example: ``` switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/2 switch(config-if)# ``` | Enters interface configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | no switchport  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# no switchport ``` | Configures the interface as a Layer 3 routed interface. |
| **Step 5** | hsrp group-number [ ipv4 ]  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# hsrp 2 switch(config-if-hsrp)# ``` | Creates an HSRP group and enters hsrp configuration mode. |
| **Step 6** | priority [ value ]  Example: ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# priority 254 ``` | Sets the priority level used to select the active router in an HSRP group. The range is from 0 to 255. The default is 100. |
| **Step 7** | track object-number [ decrement value ]  Example: ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# track 1 decrement 20 ``` | Specifies an object to be tracked that affects the weighting of an HSRP interface.  The value  argument specifies a reduction in the priority of an HSRP interface when a tracked object fails. The range is from 1 to 255. The default is 10. |
| **Step 8** | preempt [ delay [ minimum seconds ] [ reload seconds ] [ sync seconds]]  Example: ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# preempt delay minimum 60 ``` | Configures the router to take over as the active router for an HSRP group if it has a higher priority than the current active router. This command is disabled by default. The range is from 0 to 3600 seconds. |
| **Step 9** | (Optional) show hsrp interface interface-type number  Example: ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# show hsrp interface ethernet 1/2 ``` | (Optional)  Displays HSRP information for an interface. |
| **Step 10** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config-if)# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Saves this configuration change. |

#### Example

This example shows how to configure HSRP object tracking on Ethernet 1/2:

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# track 1 interface ethernet 2/2 line-protocol
switch(config)# interface ethernet 1/2
switch(config-if)# no switchport
switch(config-if)# hsrp 2
switch(config-if-hsrp)# track 1 decrement 20
switch(config-if-hsrp)# copy running-config startup-config
```

### Configuring the HSRP Priority

You can configure the HSRP priority on an interface. HSRP uses the priority to determine which HSRP group member acts as the
active router.

To configure the HSRP priority, use the following command in interface configuration mode:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| priority level [ forwarding-threshold lower lower-value upper upper-value ]  **Example:**  ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# priority 60 forwarding-threshold lower 40 upper 50 ``` | Sets the priority level used to select the active router in an HSRP group. The level  range is from 0 to 255. The default is 100. |

### Customizing HSRP

You can optionally customize the behavior of HSRP. Be aware that as soon as you enable an HSRP group by configuring a virtual
IP address, that group is now operational. If you first enable an HSRP group before customizing HSRP, the router could take
control over the group and become the active router before you finish customizing the feature. If you plan to customize HSRP,
you should do so before you enable the HSRP group.

To customize HSRP, use the following commands in hsrp configuration mode:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| name string  **Example:**  ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# name HSRP-1 ``` | Specifies the IP redundancy name for an HSRP group. The string  is from 1 to 255 characters. The default string has the following format: hsrp-interface-short-name-group-id  For example,  ``` hsrp-Eth2/1-1 ``` |
| preempt [ delay [ minimum seconds ] [ reload seconds ] [ sync seconds ]]  **Example:**  ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# preempt delay minimum 60 ``` | Configures the router to take over as an active router for an HSRP group if it has a higher priority than the current active router. This command is disabled by default. The range is from 0 to 3600 seconds. |
| timers [ msec ] hellotime [ msec ] holdtime  **Example:**  ``` switch(config-if-hsrp)# timers 5 18 ``` | Configures the hello and hold time for this HSRP member as follows:  The optional msec  keyword specifies that the argument is expressed in milliseconds, instead of the default seconds. The timer ranges for milliseconds are as follows:   * hellotime  —The interval between successive hello packets sent. The range is from 255 to 999 milliseconds. * holdtime  —The interval before the information in the hello packet is considered invalid. The range is from 750 to 3000 milliseconds. |

To customize HSRP, use the following commands in interface configuration mode:

| Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| hsrp delay minimum seconds  **Example:**  ``` switch(config-if)# hsrp delay minimum 30 ``` | Specifies the minimum amount of time that HSRP waits after a group is enabled before participating in the group. The range is from 0 to 10000 seconds. The default is 0. |
| hsrp delay reload seconds  **Example:**  ``` switch(config-if)# hsrp delay reload 30 ``` | Specifies the minimum amount of time that HSRP waits after reload before participating in the group. The range is from 0 to 10000 seconds. The default is 0. |

## Verifying the HSRP Configuration

To display the HSRP configuration information, perform one of the following tasks:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| show hsrp [group group-number] | Displays the HSRP status for all groups or one group. |
| show hsrp delay [interface interface-type slot/port] | Displays the HSRP delay value for all interfaces or one interface. |
| show hsrp [interface interface-type slot/port] | Displays the HSRP status for an interface. |
| show hsrp [group group-number] [interface interface-type slot/port] [active] [all] [init] [learn] [listen] [speak] [standby] | Displays the HSRP status for a group or interface for virtual forwarders in the active, init, learn, listen, or standby state. Use the all  keyword to see all states, including disabled. |
| show hsrp [group group-number] [interface interface-type slot/port] active] [all] [init] [learn] [listen] [speak] [standby] brief | Displays a brief summary of the HSRP status for a group or interface for virtual forwarders in the active, init, learn, listen, or standby state. Use the all  keyword to see all states, including disabled. |

## Configuration Examples for HSRP

This example shows how to enable HSRP on an interface with MD5 authentication and interface tracking:

```
key chain hsrp-keys
key 0
key-string 7 zqdest
accept-lifetime 00:00:00 Jun 01 2008 23:59:59 Sep 12 2008
send-lifetime 00:00:00 Jun 01 2008 23:59:59 Aug 12 2008
key 1
key-string 7 uaeqdyito
accept-lifetime 00:00:00 Aug 12 2008 23:59:59 Dec 12 2008
send-lifetime 00:00:00 Sep 12 2008 23:59:59 Nov 12 2008
feature hsrp
track 2 interface ethernet 2/2 ip
interface ethernet 1/2
no switchport
ip address 192.0.2.2/8
hsrp 1
authenticate md5 key-chain hsrp-keys
priority 90
track 2 decrement 20
ip-address 192.0.2.10
no shutdown
```

This example shows how to configure an HSRP subnet VIP address, which is configured in a different subnet than that of the
interface IP address:

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# feature hsrp
switch(config)# feature interface-vlan
switch(config)# interface vlan 2
switch(config-if)# ip address 192.0.2.1/24
switch(config-if)# hsrp 2
switch(config-if-hsrp)# ip 209.165.201.1/24
```

This example shows a VIP mismatch error when a VIP without a subnet is configured in a different subnet than the interface
IP address:

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# feature hsrp
switch(config)# feature interface-vlan
switch(config)# interface vlan 2
switch(config-if)# ip address 192.0.2.1/24
switch(config-if)# hsrp 2
switch(config-if-hsrp)# ip 209.165.201.1
!ERROR: VIP subnet mismatch with interface IP!
```

This example shows a VIP mismatch error when the HSRP subnet VIP address is configured in the same subnet as the interface
IP address:

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# feature hsrp
switch(config)# feature interface-vlan
switch(config)# interface vlan 2
switch(config-if)# ip address 192.0.2.1/24
switch(config-if)# hsrp 2
switch(config-if-hsrp)# ip 192.0.2.10/24
!ERROR: Subnet VIP cannot be in same subnet as interface IP!
```

| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.8 |

"text": "Cisco IOS XR Software\r\n\r\nAfter being upgraded to a fixed release of Cisco IOS XR Software, the device is able to detect IPv6 packets that may be improperly processed. Once detected, the device sends these packets to the main CPU for further processing. This activity may result in reduced performance in forwarding IPv6 packets that match specific network traffic patterns.\r\n\r\nIf the device is not configured to perform IPv6 packets classification, administrators can disable the CPU-based inspection for IPv6 packets. The feature can be disabled by using the CLI command hw-module profile acl ipv6 ext-header permit in global configuration mode. Customers should be aware that this action will expose the device to the vulnerability that is described in the advisory, even if the device is running a fixed Cisco IOS XR Software release.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability described in this advisory only applies to IPv6 packets that traverse an affected device. It does not apply to IPv4 traffic or to IPv6 traffic that is destined for an affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco NX-OS Software\r\n\r\nTo protect a device from this vulnerability, administrators must install a fixed release of Cisco NX-OS Software and apply the rule extension-header deny-all to any IPv6 ACL that is configured on the device. A device should be considered vulnerable until the rule extension-header deny-all has been applied to all IPv6 ACLs that are configured on the device, even if it is running a fixed Cisco NX-OS Software release.\r\n\r\nBeginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(7), Cisco Nexus 3600 Platform Switches and Cisco Nexus 9500 R-Series Switching Platforms include the rule extension-header {permit-all | deny-all} for the disposition of IPv6 packets that include extension headers. The rule is not enabled by default.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS XR and Cisco NX-OS Software IPv6 Access Control List Bypass Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-ipv6-acl-CHgdYk8j  First Published: 2021 February 3 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvm55638](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvm55638)  [CSCvv45698](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv45698)     CVE-2021-1389     CWE-284       CVSS Score: [Base 5.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:N/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2021-1389     CWE-284       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipv6-acl-CHgdYk8j/csaf/cisco-sa-ipv6-acl-CHgdYk8j.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the IPv6 traffic processing of Cisco IOS XR Software and Cisco NX-OS Software for certain Cisco devices could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass an IPv6 access control list (ACL) that is configured for an interface of an affected device.  The vulnerability is due to improper processing of IPv6 traffic that is sent through an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted IPv6 packets that traverse the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to access resources that would typically be protected by the interface ACL.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-ipv6-acl-CHgdYk8j>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco devices if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XR Software or Cisco NX-OS Software and had IPv6 ACL configured:    + Network Convergence System (NCS) 540 Series Routers   + NCS 560 Series Routers   + NCS 5500 Series   + Nexus 3600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 9500 R-Series Switching Platforms For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Determine the Configuration for Cisco IOS XR Software**  Use the **show running-config | include ipv6 access-list** command to view the configured ACLs for IPv6. If this command produces an output, the device should be considered vulnerable. The following example shows the output on a device that has the IPv6 ACL configured:  ```   Router# show running-config  | include ipv6 access-listipv6 access-list    ```  This does not apply to IPv4 ACLs.  **Determine the Configuration for Cisco NX-OS Software**  Use the **show ipv6 access-lists** command to view the configured ACLs for IPv6. If this command produces an output, the device should be considered vulnerable. The following example shows the output on a device that has the IPv6 ACL configured:  ```   Nexus# show ipv6 access-lists   IPv6 access list    ```  This does not apply to IPv4 ACLs. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + NCS 520 Series Routers   + NCS 5000 Series Switches   + NCS 6000 Series Routers   + IOS XR SW-only   + IOS XRv 9000 Routers   + ASR 9000 Series Aggregation Services Routers   + Carrier Routing System (CRS)   + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * **Cisco IOS XR Software**  After being upgraded to a fixed release of Cisco IOS XR Software, the device is able to detect IPv6 packets that may be improperly processed. Once detected, the device sends these packets to the main CPU for further processing. This activity may result in reduced performance in forwarding IPv6 packets that match specific network traffic patterns.  If the device is not configured to perform IPv6 packets classification, administrators can disable the CPU-based inspection for IPv6 packets. The feature can be disabled by using the CLI command **hw-module profile acl ipv6 ext-header permit** in global configuration mode. Customers should be aware that this action will expose the device to the vulnerability that is described in the advisory, even if the device is running a fixed Cisco IOS XR Software release.  The vulnerability described in this advisory only applies to IPv6 packets that traverse an affected device. It does not apply to IPv4 traffic or to IPv6 traffic that is destined for an affected device.  **Cisco NX-OS Software**  To protect a device from this vulnerability, administrators must install a fixed release of Cisco NX-OS Software and apply the rule **extension-header deny-all** to any IPv6 ACL that is configured on the device. A device should be considered vulnerable until the rule **extension-header deny-all** has been applied to all IPv6 ACLs that are configured on the device, even if it is running a fixed Cisco NX-OS Software release.  Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 9.3(7), Cisco Nexus 3600 Platform Switches and Cisco Nexus 9500 R-Series Switching Platforms include the rule **extension-header {permit-all | deny-all}** for the disposition of IPv6 packets that include extension headers. The rule is not enabled by default. With the rule **extension-header deny-all** configured, the device will drop any IPv6 packet with at least one extension header, regardless of any other IPv6 ACL rules that match other fields of the packet.  If the rule **extension-header permit-all** is configured, then the device is vulnerable.  For detailed information about configuring **extension-header {permit-all | deny-all}**, see the [Cisco Nexus 3600 NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3600/sw/93x/unicast/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_010010.html) or the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/unicast/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-series-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x.html).  For detailed information about configuring ACLs, see the [Cisco Nexus 3600 NX-OS Security Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3600/sw/93x/security/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_01.html) or the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/security/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide_7x.html).  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Fixed Releases **Cisco IOS XR Software**  At the time of publication, Cisco IOS XR Software releases 6.6.3, 6.7.1, 7.1.1, 7.2.1, and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.  See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  **Cisco NX-OS Software**  After upgrading a device to a fixed release of Cisco NX-OS Software, customers must apply the rule **extension-header deny-all** to any IPv6 ACL that is configured on the device. The rule is not enabled by default. A device should be considered vulnerable until the rule **extension-header deny-all** has been applied to all IPv6 ACLs that are configured on the device, even if it is running a fixed Cisco NX-OS Software release.  For detailed information about configuring the **extension-header deny-all** rule, see the [Cisco Nexus 3600 NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3600/sw/93x/unicast/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-3600-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_010010.html) or the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Unicast Routing Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/unicast/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-series-nx-os-unicast-routing-configuration-guide-93x.html).  To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release-for example, **7.0(3)I7(5)** for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or **14.0(1h)** for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:    Cisco NX-OS Software   Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode   MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   Nexus 1000V Series Switches   Nexus 3000 Series Switches   Nexus 5000 Series Switches   Nexus 6000 Series Switches   Nexus 7000 Series Switches   Nexus 9000 Series Switches        By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.
