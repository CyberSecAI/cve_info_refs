Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-1056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux, specifically in the kernel mode layer (`nvidia.ko`).
*   The driver does not completely honor operating system file system permissions. This means it doesn't properly enforce access controls to provide sufficient GPU device-level isolation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient File System Permission Enforcement:** The core issue is that the driver bypasses or improperly applies file system permission checks, leading to inadequate isolation between different users or processes accessing the GPU.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker could potentially manipulate the GPU in a way that makes it unavailable or unstable, disrupting system services relying on the GPU.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  Due to the lack of proper isolation, an attacker could gain access to sensitive information that they should not have access to. This could include data related to other users' GPU processes or data residing in GPU memory.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is local. This means the attacker needs to have access to the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User:** A local user with low privileges can exploit this vulnerability. The attacker does not need special permissions beyond normal user access.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-1056 describes a vulnerability in the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Linux where insufficient enforcement of file system permissions allows a local user to potentially cause a denial of service or information disclosure by improperly accessing the GPU.
