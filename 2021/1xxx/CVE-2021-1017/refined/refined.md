  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-1017",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the Bluetooth component where AdapterService and GattService are accessed from BluetoothManagerService but were intended to be accessed only by BluetoothManagerService. This could allow 3rd party apps to bind to those services, bypassing intended access controls.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Incorrect access control",
        "Improper restriction of API functionality"
      ],
      "impact": "Elevation of privilege. A malicious third-party application could potentially bind to Bluetooth services (AdapterService and GattService) that are intended for internal use by the BluetoothManagerService only, potentially enabling unauthorized actions or access to data.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "Local malicious application"
      ],
      "required_capabilities": "A malicious application installed on the device."
    },
  {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-1017",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of a flag to prevent non-system overlays from obscuring the USB permission dialog.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Lack of proper window overlay restrictions",
          "Inadequate permission dialog protection"
         ],
        "impact": "Elevation of Privilege. An attacker could potentially craft an overlay that mimics the USB permission dialog, tricking users into granting unintended permissions when they think they are interacting with the legitimate system UI.",
        "attack_vectors": [
          "Malicious application using window overlay"
        ],
        "required_capabilities": "A malicious application with the ability to create window overlays."
