Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1173:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The provided content includes a Cisco Security Advisory specifically addressing multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers. This advisory lists **CVE-2021-1173** among other CVEs.
   - The advisory describes a set of vulnerabilities related to both the UPnP service and the web-based management interface of the routers.
  
**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability (CVE-2021-1173 Specific):**
   - The primary cause of CVE-2021-1173 is the "improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface." This means the router's web interface does not adequately sanitize or validate data it receives through HTTP requests.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    -  **CWE-121** is indicated which is a Stack-based Buffer Overflow
    - The vulnerability lies in the web-based management interface of the listed Cisco Small Business routers.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Remote Command Execution:** An attacker with valid administrator credentials could exploit the vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on the router as the *root* user on the underlying operating system.
    - **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploit could also cause the device to reload (reboot), resulting in a DoS condition.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is primarily through crafted HTTP requests sent to the vulnerable web-based management interface. This can occur from:
        - **Local LAN:** Exploitation is possible from a local network connection since the web interface is always accessible via LAN
        - **Remote WAN (if enabled):** If the remote management feature is enabled, the attacker could exploit the router over the WAN interface
  
**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Administrator Credentials:**  To exploit the specific vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-1173, the attacker *must* have valid administrator credentials for the affected router.
    -  **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the router, either locally (LAN) or remotely (WAN if remote management is enabled).

**Additional Notes:**

*   **No Fix Available:** Cisco has stated that they will not be releasing software updates for these end-of-life products.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available that address the vulnerabilities, so migration to supported devices is recommended.
*  **High Severity:** The web management interface issues (which CVE-2021-1173 falls under) are considered high severity issues.
*   **Multiple CVEs:** The advisory lists a large number of CVEs (59 CVEs) affecting the same product line, both in the UPnP service and the web interface.

**Summary of CVE-2021-1173**
CVE-2021-1173 is a specific vulnerability among multiple flaws that exist in Cisco Small Business RV series routers. It is a remote command execution and denial of service vulnerability that resides in the web-based management interface, which can be exploited by an authenticated remote attacker with administrator credentials through crafted HTTP requests. Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution as root, or a device reload, and this vulnerability does not have an available fix or workaround.
