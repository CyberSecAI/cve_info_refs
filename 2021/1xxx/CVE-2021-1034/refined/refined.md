Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1034:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation within the `RttServiceImpl#startRanging` function in the Android framework. Specifically, an application could potentially provide a fake package name which isn't their own. Although the service method would still use `Binder.getCallingUid()` for the actual check, the lack of a prior UID-to-package name check allowed for potential information leakage about other installed packages.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An app could potentially discover whether another app is installed on a device by passing that app's package name to the vulnerable service. The service would throw an exception if the passed in package name wasn't associated with the calling app's UID. The exception message would contain the provided package name, as well as the UID of the calling app.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially gain knowledge about the presence or absence of specific apps installed on the device. This information could be used for targeted attacks, or profiling of users based on app usage.

**Attack vectors:**

*   A malicious application can call the vulnerable `RttServiceImpl#startRanging` service with a package name.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target Android device.
*   The attacker application needs to be able to make calls to the `RttServiceImpl#startRanging` service, typically requiring a specific permission to utilize the service functionality.

**Additional notes:**

*   The fix involves adding an additional check to verify if the provided UID matches the package name. This prevents the application from passing a fake package name.
*   The commit messages also indicate that the issue affects device phone number checks as well. The fix addresses this for device phone numbers as well.
*   The provided commits directly address the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1034 and provide a good level of detail.
