Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-1116:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows.
- A NULL pointer dereference occurs within the kernel.
- This NULL pointer is created as a result of user-mode code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- NULL pointer dereference: The core weakness is the dereferencing of a NULL pointer, which causes the program to access an invalid memory location.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of service: Exploiting this vulnerability can lead to a system crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs local access to the system.
- User-mode code execution: The vulnerability is triggered by user-mode code that causes a NULL pointer dereference in the kernel.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the vulnerable system.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges; unprivileged system access is sufficient.
- The attacker needs to execute code that can trigger the creation of the vulnerable NULL pointer, which then causes a dereference in the kernel.
