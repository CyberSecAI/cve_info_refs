Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1195:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is caused by improper validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W routers. Specifically, it's related to crafted HTTP requests sent to the affected device.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Input Validation:** The web-based management interface fails to properly sanitize or validate user-provided input, specifically within crafted HTTP requests, making the system vulnerable to exploitation.
- **Remote Command Execution:**  Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows the execution of arbitrary code on the device as the `root` user.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can also lead to an unexpected device restart, resulting in a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Complete compromise:** A successful exploit grants the attacker `root` access on the device, leading to a complete compromise of the system and allowing full control.
- **Denial of Service:**  The ability to force device restarts disrupts services and network availability.
- **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:**  The vulnerability could be leveraged to gain access to sensitive data, modify configurations and cause service disruption

**Attack Vectors:**

-   **Remote Attack:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.
-  **Web-based Management Interface:** The attack vector is through the web-based management interface of the affected devices.
-   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends specially crafted HTTP requests to the vulnerable interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Administrator Credentials:** To exploit the vulnerability in the management interface, the attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.
-   **Network Accessibility:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the management interface. This could be through a local LAN connection or through the WAN if the remote management feature is enabled.

**Additional details:**
- This is one of multiple vulnerabilities affecting these devices and is part of the same advisory.
- There are no workarounds available.
- Cisco has no plans to release software updates to address this vulnerability, as the affected devices have reached their end-of-life.

The provided information is more detailed than a typical CVE description, explaining the nature of the improper input validation, the specific attack vector (HTTP requests), and the impact of successful exploitation. It also notes that the attacker requires administrator credentials for the exploitation.
