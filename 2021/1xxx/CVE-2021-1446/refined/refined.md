**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   The vulnerability is due to a logic error in the DNS Application Layer Gateway (ALG) functionality used by Network Address Translation (NAT) in Cisco IOS XE Software. Specifically, a logic error occurs when the device inspects certain crafted DNS packets.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   A logic error in the DNS ALG used by NAT.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An unauthenticated, remote attacker could exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted DNS packets through an affected device that is performing NAT for DNS packets.
    *   Successful exploitation could cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   Remote attack vector via crafted DNS packets sent through an affected device performing NAT for DNS packets.
    *   The vulnerability is exploited via IPv4 packets and not exploitable via IPv6 traffic.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send crafted DNS packets through an affected device.
    *   The attacker does not require authentication.
*   **Mitigation:**
    *   Disable the NAT ALG for DNS packets using the commands `no ip nat service dns tcp` and `no ip nat service dns udp` in global configuration mode. However, this may negatively impact normal network operations if the DNS ALG is required.
*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Cisco devices running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS XE Software that is configured for NAT operation and has the DNS ALG feature enabled.

**Additional details:**
*   The DNS ALG feature is enabled by default as soon as NAT is configured.
*   The document highlights how to check if NAT is enabled and the DNS ALG is disabled by using the commands `show ip nat statistics` and `show running-config | include ip nat service dns`, respectively.
*   The vulnerability does not affect Cisco IOS Software, IOS XR Software, and NX-OS Software.
* The provided output from `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com_2d6bd226_20250115_112418.html` includes the CVSS vector string: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X`

In summary, the provided information indicates that CVE-2021-1446 is a high-severity vulnerability in Cisco IOS XE Software related to DNS ALG within NAT, leading to a potential DoS by crafted IPv4 DNS packets.
