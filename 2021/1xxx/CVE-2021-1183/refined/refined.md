Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2021-1183:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided content includes a Cisco Security Advisory titled "Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers Remote Command Execution and Denial of Service Vulnerabilities". This advisory explicitly lists CVE-2021-1183 as one of the vulnerabilities addressed. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
    *   **CVE-2021-1183:** The vulnerability is caused by improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of the affected routers. This improper validation allows an attacker to send crafted HTTP requests to the device.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied inputs in the web-based management interface of the routers.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A successful exploit can allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the `root` user on the underlying operating system.
    *   Alternatively, an attacker can cause the device to reload, leading to a denial of service (DoS) condition.
*  **Attack Vectors:**
     *  The attack vector is through crafted HTTP requests sent to the web-based management interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated with valid administrator credentials to exploit the web-based management interface vulnerabilities.
    *   The web interface can be reached via the local LAN (always enabled) or via the WAN interface, if remote management is enabled. The remote management feature is disabled by default.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   The advisory explicitly states that there are no available workarounds for these vulnerabilities.
*   Cisco will not release software updates to fix these vulnerabilities as the affected products have entered the end-of-life process. Customers are advised to migrate to newer Cisco Small Business RV series routers.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Kai Cheng of the Institute of Information Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 7.2 and a HIGH Security Impact Rating (SIR).
*   The advisory includes numerous other CVEs related to the same vulnerability including CVE-2021-1159, CVE-2021-1160, CVE-2021-1161 etc.

**4. CVSS Vector:**

The CVSS vector for this particular vulnerability is: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**5.  Affected Products:**
    *   RV110W Wireless-N VPN Firewall
