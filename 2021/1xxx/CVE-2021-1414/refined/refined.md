    "CVE": "CVE-2021-1414",
    "details": "This vulnerability allows network-adjacent attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Cisco RV340 routers. Authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.  The specific flaw exists within the processing of JSON-RPC requests. When parsing the usmUserPrivKey property, the process does not properly validate a user-supplied string before using it to execute a system call. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the www-data user.",
