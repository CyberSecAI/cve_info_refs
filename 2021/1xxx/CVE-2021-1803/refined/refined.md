- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A logic issue in the Sandbox component of macOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A local application could leverage a flaw in the sandbox to enumerate the user's iCloud documents.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A sandboxed application can bypass sandbox restrictions and enumerate the user's iCloud documents, potentially leading to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious, locally installed application can exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have a local application that is able to exploit the sandbox.
