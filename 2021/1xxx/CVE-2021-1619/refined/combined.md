An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-aaa-Yx47ZT8Q>  This advisory is part of the September 2021 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: September 2021 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74581)  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco IOS XE Software if it is running in autonomous or controller mode and Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software. For either to be affected, all of the following must be configured:    + AAA   + NETCONF, RESTCONF, or both   + **enable password** without **enable secret** For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  **Note:** The standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN release images are separate from the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases. The SD-WAN feature set was first integrated into the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases starting with IOS XE Software Release 17.2.1r. For additional information, see the [Install and Upgrade Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r and Later](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/install-upgrade-17-2-later.html) chapter of the *Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide*. Determine the Device Configuration To determine whether a device has a vulnerable configuration, do the following:  **Check AAA Configuration**  To determine whether AAA authentication is configured on the device, use the **show running-config | include aaa authentication login** command, as shown in the following example:  ```   Router#show running-config | include aaa authentication loginaaa authentication login default local group exampleRouter#   ```  **Check NETCONF and RESTCONF Configuration**  To determine whether NETCONF or RESTCONF is configured on the device, use the **show running-config | include netconf|restconf** command, as shown in the following example:  ```   Router#show running-config | include netconf|restconfnetconf-yangrestconfRouter#   ```  **Check enable password Configuration**  To determine whether **enable password** is configured on the device without the presence of an **enable secret**, use the **show running-config | include enable password|secret** command, as shown in the following example:  ```   Router#show running-config | include enable password|secretenable password 7 00010B07094B0703Router#   ```  **Note:** If **enable secret** is being used without the presence of **enable password**, the device is not affected. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XR Software   + Meraki products   + NX-OS Software  Workarounds  * **There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability:** Remove the **enable password** and configure an **enable secret**. For more information, see [Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc14).  **There is also a mitigation that addresses this vulnerability:** To limit the attack surface of this vulnerability, ensure that access control lists (ACLs) are in place for NETCONF and RESTCONF to prevent attempted access from untrusted subnets. For more information, see [NETCONF and RESTCONF Service-Level ACLs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/prog/configuration/1611/b_1611_programmability_cg/service_level_ACLs_NETCONF_RESTCONF.html).  While this workaround and this mitigation have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**:     By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Cisco IOS XE Image Compatibility

| Deployment Image Version | Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN | Non Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco IOS XE Releases 16.9.x, 16.10.x, 16.11.x, 16.12.x | ucmk9 | universalk9 |
| Cisco IOS XE Release 17.1.x | NA | universalk9 |
| Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.x and later | universalk9\* | universalk9\*\* |

* \* For Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN use case, non-LI and non-payload encryption image types are not supported.
* \*\* For non Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN use case, non-LI and non-payload encryption image types are supported (universalk9\_noli, universalk9\_npe, universalk9\_npe\_noli).

## Upgrade Considerations

The following Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices support multirate interfaces and support the 1GE small form-factor pluggable (SFP) (optical and CU) and 10GE SFP+ (optical
and CU) modules on their 10G interfaces ports:

* Cisco ASR 1001-HX Router
* Cisco Catalyst 8500-12X4QC
* Cisco Catalyst 8500-12X

These devices support auto-negotiation on 10G interfaces ports with 1GE SFP (optical and CU) modules. The following notes
apply to auto-negotiation in both SD-WAN and non-SD-WAN modes of the above three router models only:

* For releases before Cisco IOS XE 17.6.1a, auto-negotiation can be configured using the CLI.
* For releases before Cisco IOS XE 17.6.1a, if you use the CLI or Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN to reboot a device with a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module, that interface will not come up. In this situation,
  use Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN or the CLI to configure `no negotiation auto` for the interface, then reboot the device.
* From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, `auto neg` values for auto-negotiation are pushed to 10G interfaces on supported devices through feature templates. Ensure that you
  know which SFP module is on which 10G interface on a device so that you can properly configure the feature template.
* On software releases upto Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, the `negotiation auto` command is not supported on a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module.
* From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.4 onwards, the negotiation auto command is supported on a 10G interface with 10 GE SFP+ module.
  In this scenario, in the output of `show interface Tengig x/x/x`, the link type is force-up regardless of `negotiation auto/no negotiation auto` configuration. The same is applicable when the configurations are pushed through Cisco SD-WAN Manager template.
* From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.4 onwards, the negotiation auto command is supported on a 10G interface that includes a 1GE
  Fiber and Copper SFP.
* On software releases upto Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, the `no negotiation auto` command with the default OFF option must be sent through a feature template to all 10G interfaces that include a 10GE SFP+
  module. Otherwise, the template push fails.
* Before upgrading to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, use a feature template, a CLI add-on feature templates, or the CLI to `apply no negotiation auto` to all 10G interfaces that include a 10GE SFP+ module.
* If you upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a from a release in which auto-negotiation was enabled on a 10G interface that
  includes a 10GE SFP+ module, that interface will not come up. In this situation, use the CLI to configure `no negotiation auto` for the interface after the upgrade completes.
* Before upgrading to Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Release 20.12.1 or Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.12.1a or later releases, contact Cisco TAC to check and drop any non-compatible indexes. Non-compatible old index can impact successful
  upgrade to newer version.
* In ASR 1001-HX, multi-rate supported only on last 4 ports of bay1 8X10G/1G.

Following notes are applicable for C8300, C8500L-8S4X models of routers:

* From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.15.1 onwards, the `negotiation auto` command is supported on a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module.
* From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.15.1 onwards, on a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module, in the output of `show interface Tengig x/x/x` the link type will show as force-up always regardless of `negotiation auto/no negotiation auto` configuration. The same is applicable when the configurations are pushed through Cisco SD-WAN Manager template.

Table 2. Auto Negotiation Configurations

| **C8500** | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SFPs | Default Auto Negotiation | Default Speed | Default Duplex |
| 1G Copper | OFF | 1000M | Full |
| 1G Optical | OFF | 1000M | Full |
| 10G Optical | OFF | 10000M | Full |
| **C8300** | | | |
| 1G Copper | ON | 1000M | Full |
| 1G Optical | ON | 1000M | Full |
| 10G Optical | ON | 10000M | Full |

| **Note** | ---   Ensure that negotiation configuration matches with the peer device interface settings. If there is a mismatch in the interface settings, the interface may go down.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Restrictions

### Restrictions for single "universalk9" image

* Dual-IOSd is supported only in autonomous mode.
* Images without payload encryption and NO-LI (universalk9\_npe, universalk9\_noli, universalk9\_npe\_noli) images are not supported
  in controller mode. Only universalk9 images are supported.
* After onboarding and determining the mode of operation, changing from Controller mode to Autonomous mode or vice-versa, results
  in the loss of configuration.
* Reset button functionality is not supported in controller mode on Cisco ISR 1000 series Integrated Service Routers. The reset
  button does not function to restore a golden image or configuration in controller mode.
* Auto-install (Python and TCL scripts) and ZTP—Autoinstall and ZTP are not supported in controller mode. If DHCP discovers
  an attempt to install using either of these processes, a mode change to Autonomous mode is triggered.
* WebUI—In controller mode, WebUI is not supported and an error message is displayed, if used.

## Self-Signed Trustpoint

A self-signed trustpoint is generated and loaded to a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device when the device boots up. If this trustpoint is deleted for any reason, you can generate and load a new trustpoint by rebooting
the device. The new key may be different than the deleted one.

## Introducing Autonomous and Controller Mode

The Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r release introduces two installation modes – Autonomous and Controller modes. The autonomous mode supports the functionality
of Cisco IOS XE non Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN deployment and the controller mode supports the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN solution.

The following are the main differences between Autonomous mode and Controller mode:

Table 3.

| Feature | Autonomous Mode | Controller Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Configuration Method | * Command Line Interface (CLI) * NETCONF | YANG-based configuration   * Cisco SD-WAN Manager * NETCONF |
| Onboarding Modes | * Plug and Play * Config-Wizard * WebUI * Bootstrap (USB, bootflash, and so on) * Auto-Install (Python Script, TCL Script) * ZTP (Using DHCP Option 150 and Option 67) | * Plug and Play * Bootstrap (USB, bootflash, and so on) |
| Licensing | Cisco Smart Licensing | Cisco High Performance Security (HSEC) software licensing. No device licensing. |
| Image Type | Universalk9 | Universalk9 |
| Dual-IOSd redundancy model | Supported | Not Supported |
| High Availability | Supported | Not Supported |
| Global configuration mode | configure terminal | config-transaction |

| Feature Name | Release Information | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Support for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Platform on OpenStack Train | Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.7.1a | This feature introduces support for managing a Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge software platform hosted in the OpenStack cloud computing platform "Train" release. |

Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.4.1a, Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN supports the Cisco Catalyst 8000V virtual router platform, which replaces the Cisco CSR1000V and Cisco ISRv. Installing the Cisco Catalyst 8000V in an Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN environment requires Cisco vManage Release 20.4.1 or later.

Download the Cisco Catalyst 8000V software image that is appropriate for your method of deployment. For example, this can be an OVA file for ESXi, or a QCOW2
image for OpenStack or KVM. Do not choose an ISO image. Have the image ready to upload to the Cisco SD-WAN Manager software image repository. The file name begins with: c8000v-universalk9

| **Note** | ---   To operate with Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, the device must be in controller mode. When starting the device in controller mode, boot the device using the bootflash:packages.conf file.   --- |
| --- | --- |

For complete information about the platform, including installation in KVM, ESXi, and OpenStack environments, see the [Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Installation and Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/C8000V/Configuration/c8000v-installation-configuration-guide.html). For information about creating a bootstrap file for onboarding the Cisco Catalyst 8000V into Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, see [Bootstrap Process for ​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Cloud-Hosted Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/install-upgrade-17-2-later.html#bootstrap-process-sd-wan-cloud-hosted-devices).

#### Clean Install

We recommend a clean install of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V. This ensures support for all features, provides the most up-to-date licensing, and ensures that devices and the controller
stay synchronized. For cases where upgrade is necessary, see the procedure in **Upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r or Later**.

| **Note** | ---   After a clean install of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V, it is not possible to downgrade the device to a release earlier than Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.4.1a.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Upgrading a Cisco CSR1000V to a Cisco Catalyst 8000V

Upgrading a Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco ISRv virtual router to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.4.1a includes upgrading to the Cisco Catalyst 8000V. Note the following:

* The Cisco Catalyst 8000V preserves all of the functionality available on Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco ISRv platforms.
* Performing the upgrade in Cisco SD-WAN Manager preserves the configuration of the device(s) being upgraded.

#### OpenStack

Installing a Cisco Catalyst 8000V on the OpenStack Train release requires using a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.7.1a or later image for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V.

Cisco does not support installing a Cisco Catalyst 8000V on OpenStack using an earlier image, or installing on OpenStack using an earlier image and upgrading to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.7.1a.

## Plug and Play in Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r and Later Releases

* [Plug and Play Onboarding Workflow](#plug-and-play-onboarding-workflow)
* [Mode Discovery with Plug and Play Onboarding](#mode-discovery-with-pnp-onboarding)
* [Automatic IP Address Detection](#Cisco_Concept.dita_e27e49b5-3224-4605-83d4-8be5267c067b)

### Plug and Play Onboarding Workflow

1. Place an order for the device in Cisco Commerce with Smart Account and Virtual Account details of the customer.
2. The device information from Cisco Commerce like Device serial number, Smart Account, and Virtual Account are added to the
   Plug and Play portal.
3. Add a Cisco SD-WAN Validator controller profile into the Plug and Play (PnP) portal for the same Smart Account and Virtual Accounts.
4. Associate the new device to the Cisco SD-WAN Validator controller profile manually.
5. PnP sends all relevant information including Cisco SD-WAN Validator details, device serial number, organization name, and network ID to Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).
6. Download the device serial number file (provisioning file) from PnP and upload it to Cisco SD-WAN Manager. The devices are now available on Cisco SD-WAN Manager. You can also use the Sync Smart Account option on Cisco SD-WAN Manager to sync the device with your virtual account and populate the device in Cisco SD-WAN Manager.

| **Note** | ---   If you created and scheduled a device template on Cisco vManage Release 20.3.x and upgraded Cisco SD-WAN Manager to Cisco vManage Release 20.4.1 or later before onboarding the target device, when you onboard the device using PNP or ZTP, the template push fails. To avoid this failure, reschedule the template after upgrading the Cisco SD-WAN Manager software and then onboard the device.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  If the ZTP process for a device is interrupted because the device reloads or power cycles, the ZTP process does not restart and the device comes online with the Cisco SD-WAN Manager image that was in its original configuration. In this situation, upgrade the device to the desired Cisco SD-WAN Manager release manually.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   For more information, refer to the [Plug and Play Support Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/services/downloads/SD-WAN_pnp_support_guide.pdf).   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Mode Discovery with Plug and Play Onboarding

The PnP-based discovery process determines the mode in which the device operates, based on the controller discovery and initiates
a mode change, if required. The mode change results in a reboot of the device. Once reboot is complete, the device performs
appropriate discovery process.

When you upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r or later, on a Cisco device that already runs a Cisco IOS XE or Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN image, the device starts in autonomous mode or controller mode depending on the configured controller.

Plug and Play (PnP) deployment include the following discovery process scenarios:

Table 5.

| Boot up Mode | Deployment Mode | On-boarding agent | Cisco SD-WAN Validator | Discovery Process | Mode Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Autonomous | Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) | Plug and Play | No | Plug and Play Connect Discovery or on-premise plug and play server discovery | No Mode change |
| Autonomous | Cisco SD-WAN Manager | Plug and Play | Yes | Plug and Play Connect Discovery | Mode change to controller mode |
| Controller | Cisco DNA | Plug and Play | No | Plug and Play Connect Discovery or on-premise plug and play server discovery | Mode change to autonomous mode |
| Controller | Cisco SD-WAN Manager | Plug and Play | Yes | Plug and Play Connect Discovery | No mode change |

### Automatic IP Address Detection

Table 6. Feature History

| Feature Name | Release Information | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 0 WAN Interface Automatic IP Detection using ARP | Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.7.1a  Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.7.1  Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 | This feature enables a device to automatically learn about the available IP addresses and default gateway information when a DHCP server is not available. The device assigns an IP address to its WAN interface, and then contacts the PnP server and begins the PnP onboarding process. |

Typically, the WAN interface on a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device or Cisco vEdge device is configured
as a DHCP client, and this interface receives an IP address and gateway server
information from the DHCP server during the plug-and-play (PnP) onboarding process.

If the DHCP server is not available, the device automatically learns about the available
IP addresses and default gateway information by using Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
packets. If an IP address that the device learns allows a successful connection to the
PnP server, the device continues with the PnP onboarding process.

| **Note** | ---   This feature applies only to day zero deployments and is enabled by default.   --- |
| --- | --- |

**Prerequisites for Automatic IP Address Detection**

* To trigger ARP, configure the IP address of the device as the BGP neighbor on the provider edge (PE) router.

  This PE router is the first point of contact for the device in the WAN transport network. The PE router then sends ARP packets
  with this IP address to the device. The device receives the ARP packets, and then the Automatic IP Address Detection feature
  defines the ARP destination IP address as the device's WAN interface IP address.
* For Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices, the network mask of this IP address must be 30 bits.
* For automatic IP address detection and redirection through an on-premises ZTP server, the A record of the ZTP server on the
  DNS server must be set to ztp.cisco.com. In addition, the DNS server must have an ip name-server value of 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4.

For automatic IP address detection, a device uses 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4 as the DNS server to
resolve devicehelper.cisco.com or ztp.cisco.com. The PnP process then attempts to reach
devicehelper.cisco.com or ztp.cisco.com to continue onboarding.

| **Note** | ---  An IP address that a device automatically detects is not preserved during reboots of the device that occur before the PnP onboarding completes. In such cases, an IP address is assigned automatically when the PE router ARP cache expires.  --- |
| --- | --- |

**Limitations and Restrictions for Automatic IP Address Detection**

The following limitations and restrictions apply only to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices:

* This feature is supported only on Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Service Routers,
  Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Service Router, and Cisco Catalyst 8200 and 8300
  Series Edge Platforms. On these devices, this features is supported only for
  Gigabit Ethernet Interface 0/0/0.
* The feature is supported only on devices that are in controller (SD-WAN configuration) mode. See <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/install-upgrade-17-2-later.html>.
* This feature is supported only in a simple 30 bit network mask Layer 2 network in
  which one PE router and one customer edge router are in the same VLAN.
* This feature does not support VRRP, HSRP, or GLBP on the PE router.
* An ARP destination IP address is used as the WAN interface IP address on a device
  only after the device receives the same ARP request eight times within an
  interval of 150 seconds.

### Creating a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Bootstrap Configuration File

See [On-Site Bootstrap Process for ​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/hardware-and-software-installation.html#c_On_Site_Bootstrap_Process_for_SD_WAN_Devices_12488.xml) and [Generate a Bootstrap File For Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Devices Using the CLI](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/hardware-and-software-installation.html#generate-bootstrap-file-using-cli) for information about generating a bootstrap file.

### New Installation: Mode Change Device Day Zero Scenario

1. If the device is running a pre-17.2 universalk9 image on a new box, or for an existing box where you performed write erase  and reload  and loaded a Cisco IOS XE 17.2 or newer image, the device boots in day zero configuration and in autonomous mode.
2. The new device determines if a mode change is required based on the bootstrap file.

   * If ciscosdwan.cfg or ciscosdwan\_cloud\_init.cfg bootstrap file in a plugged in the bootstrap location, mode change to controller
     mode is initiated. After the device boots up in controller mode, the configuration present in the configuration file is applied.
   * If a ciscortr.cfg bootstrap file or config-wizard is discovered, mode change is not initiated and the boot up continues in
     the Autonomous mode.

| **Note** | ---  * The bootstrap file (ciscosdwan.cfg) is generated by Cisco SD-WAN Manager, and has UUID, but no OTP. * For software devices (Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software, Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series, and Cisco ISRv), and for OTP-authenticated devices such as the Cisco ASR1002-X, use the bootstrap file ciscosdwan\_cloud\_init.cfg.   This file has OTP but no UUID validation.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Switch Modes Using Cisco CLI

Use the controller-mode command in privileged EXEC mode to switch between controller and autonomous modes.

#### Autonomous Mode

The controller-mode reset command takes the device back to day zero configuration.

```
Device# controller-mode reset
```

The controller-mode disable command switches the device to autonomous mode.

```
Device# controller-mode disable
```

| **Note** | ---   controller-mode disable should only be used for temporarily operating the device in autonomous mode. Ensure the device is returned to controller mode using the same image.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Controller Mode

| **Note** | ---   To switch the device to the controller-mode, boot the system using either the bootflash:/\*.bin or bootflash:/packages.conf file.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   If bootflash:core or harddisk:core contain core files (files containing information about process crashes), move the files to another location before changing the device to controller mode. If these files remain in the bootflash:core or harddisk:core directories, Cisco SD-WAN Manager displays an alarm after onboarding the device. You can move the files to any other directory on the device other than a core directory.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The controller-mode enable command switches the device to controller mode.

```
Device# controller-mode enable
```

#### Notes

| Note | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bundle mode | If device is booted with bundle mode (Super packages), after reboot, the image gets automatically expanded and activated to prepare the router for SDWAN operation. Devices with 4GB RAM may require an additional reboot to free up space in /bootflash. The following devices with 4GB RAM need reload:   * Cisco ISR 4451 * Cisco ISR 4431 * Cisco ISR 4461 * Cisco ISR 4351 * Cisco ISR 4331 * Cisco ISR 4321 |
| Viewing the contents of the bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller directory | You cannot view the contents of the bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller directory of a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device in either of the following conditions:   * The device is in controller mode.  or * The device is in autonomous mode and using Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.6.1a or later. |

## Mode Discovery and Mode Change with Bootstrap Files

| **Note** | ---   If your Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device is already running an older Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN configuration version or file and when you upgrade your device from Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 16.x to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r or later, the device boots up in the controller mode. To prevent the device from booting up in the controller mode, before performing the device upgrade, ensure that you remove the stale Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN configuration file from the bootflash.  Detailed steps to delete all Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN artifacts from bootflash:  delete /force bootflash:/ciscosdwan\*.cfg  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.sdwaninstallerfs  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.sdwaninternal  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/sdwan  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/vmanage-admin  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.cdb\_backup  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.installer/active  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.installer   --- |
| --- | --- |

On a device that already runs a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN image, after upgrading to a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r or later image, the device boots up in controller mode.

| **Note** | ---   Installing the Cisco Catalyst 8000V on OpenStack requires using the Cisco Catalyst 8000V image for Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.7.1a or later.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Use the controller-mode enable  command to switch from autonomous to controller mode and the controller-mode disable  command to switch from controller mode to autonomous mode.

To switch modes using CLI, ensure that the appropriate configuration files mentioned in the table below are present. After
the device boots up, the configuration present in the configuration file is applied. The device reads the configuration file
and uses the configuration information to come up on the network.

Table 7. Configuration File Prerequisites for Mode Change

| Current Mode | Mode change to | Platforms | Configuration file and location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Controller | Autonomous | All supported platforms | ciscortr.cfg in any file system available to the device |
| Autonomous | Controller | * Cisco Cloud Services Router, CSR1000v * Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Router, ISRv * Cisco Catalyst 8000V * Cisco ASR1002-X | ciscosdwan\_cloud\_init.cfg on bootflash, USB, CDROM0, or CDROM1 |
| Autonomous | Controller | * Cisco Aggregation Services Router, ASR 1000 Series * Cisco Integration Service Routers, ISR 4000 series and ISR 1000 series routers | ciscosdwan.cfg on bootflash or USB |

| **Note** | ---   On a Cisco CSR1000v device (for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2 or later) and a Cisco Catalyst 8000V (for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4 or later) image deployment, if you want to boot up the device in controller mode, load the bootstrap file generated by Cisco SD-WAN Manager by bootstrap (ESXi, KVM, and OpenStack) or user-data (AWS) or custom-data (Azure and GCP).  The following fields must be present in the ciscosdwan\_cloud\_init.cfg bootstrap file:   * otp * uuid * vbond * org  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   When the device mode is switched from autonomous to controller, the startup configuration and the information in NVRAM (certificates), are erased. This action is equivalent to running the write erase  command.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   When the device mode is switched from controller to autonomous, all Yang-based configuration is preserved and can be reused if you switch back to controller mode.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   When the device is in Day N configuration and is reloaded, the presence of a bootstrap file does not impact the device operating mode.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   You cannot view the contents of the bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller directory and .sdwanistallerfs file of a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device in either of the following conditions:   * The device is in controller mode.  or * The device is in autonomous mode and using Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.6.1a or later.   Directory, more, copy and delete operations are not allowed when the file and directory are hidden in controller-mode.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Reset Controller Mode Configuration

If you use request platform software sdwan config reset  or request platform software sdwan software reset  commands to bring the device back to controller-mode day-zero configuration, the device performs one of the following actions:

* Performs mode discovery. For more information on mode discovery, see [Mode Discovery with Plug and Play Onboarding](#mode-discovery-with-pnp-onboarding).
* Uses the appropriate configuration file to perform bootstrap. For more information on the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN bootstrap configuration file, see [Creating a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Bootstrap Configuration File](#creating-a-cisco-sd-wan-bootstrap-configuration-file).

To erase the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN configuration of the current active image, use the following CLI:

```
Device# request platform software sdwan config reset
%WARNING: Bootstrap file doesn't exist and absence of it can cause loss of connectivity to the controller.
For saving bootstrap config, use:
request platform software sdwan bootstrap-config save
Proceed to reset anyway? [confirm]
Backup of running config is saved under /bootflash/sdwan/backup.cfg
WARNING: Reload is required for config-reset to become effective.
```

| **Note** | ---   The warning listed in the above configuration is visible only on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.3.1a and later images.   --- |
| --- | --- |

For the changes to take effect, you must reload the router after running the CLI. Running this CLI ensures the configuration
for the currently installed version is wiped along with crypto keys and the device enters the day zero workflow after the
reload.

If the device is not set up to use PnP for onboarding, then it reads the configuration file in the bootflash and uses the
configuration information to come up on the network. If the device is setup to use PnP onboarding, then after reload, the
PnP discovery will start again.

| **Note** | ---   In the case of public clouds, just like a fresh install, additional bootstrap configuration is provisioned that allows you to login to the instance.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   In public cloud and NFVIS environments, ensure that a latest day-zero bootstrap configuration file (exported from Cisco SD-WAN Manager) is available in a supported location and following standard file naming conventions (example: bootflash:/ciscosdwan\_cloud\_init.cfg file), before the configuration reset operation is performed.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Warning** | ---   Failure to follow save the bootstrap file in these environments cause loss of virtual machine connectivity.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Configuration Reset

When you do a configuration reset, the device performs the following:

* Erases only the configuration of the current running image.
* Erases the certificates.
* Reboots the router with the same image. At this point, the device repeats Day-0 boot up.

### Software Reset

When you do a software reset, the device performs the following:

* Erases all SD-WAN metadata saved in the bootflash:/sdwan folder including certificates.
* Erases configuration of all the images (running as well as previously activated).
* Removes all image files except the one marked as default.
* Reboots the router with the default version image. At this point, the device repeats Day-0 boot up.

## Mode Switching: Additional Information

* [Configuration Persistence During Mode Switch](#configuration-persistence-during-mode-switch)

### Configuration Persistence During Mode Switch

Table 8.

| Current Configuration Mode | Mode Switched to | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Autonomous | Controller | Contents of NVRAM and the startup configuration are erased. Configuration is not be restored. Device is reverted to Day zero configuration. Previous running configuration is stored in bootflash.   | **Note** | When you switch from autonomous mode to controller mode, and switch back to autonomous mode, the Cisco IOS XE configuration is not restored because the startup configuration is empty. You have to manually restore configuration from the backup. | | --- | --- | |
| Controller | Autonomous | CDB contents are erased (for subsequent mode switches) and Cisco IOS configuration are not restored (as startup configuration is empty). You have to manually restore configuration from the backup. |

## Change the Console Port Access After Installation, in Controller Mode

### Before You Begin

Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have access to the Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco Catalyst 8000V router through the currently configured console access method.

### Change the Console Port Access

This procedure changes the method for connecting to the console to access a Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco Catalyst 8000V software device.

The image used for deploying the Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco Catalyst 8000V software determines the default type of console access to use, which can be virtual or serial.

The procedure includes changing the mode from controller to autonomous, and then back to controller, which is required for
operation with Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN. These mode changes cause the device to reload.

Perform the following steps to change the console port access.

1. In EXEC mode, enter enable  to enter privileged EXEC mode.

   ```
   Router> enable
   ```
2. Disable controller mode. Enter the following command and follow the prompts to complete the command.

   ```
   Device# controller-mode disable
   ```

   | **Note** | ---   This reboots the device in autonomous mode.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
3. After the device restarts, enter enable  to enter privileged EXEC mode.

   ```
   Router> enable
   ```
4. Enter global configuration mode.

   ```
   Device# configure terminal
   ```
5. Use one of the following options to configure the type of access:

   * virtual: This option specifies that the device is accessed through the hypervisor virtual VGA console.

     ```
     Device(config)# platform console virtual
     ```
   * serial: This option specifies that the device is accessed through the serial port on the virtual machine (VM).

     | **Note** | ---  + Use this option only if your hypervisor supports serial port console access. + If the device configuration is stored as a Cisco SD-WAN Manager device template and is attached to the device using Cisco SD-WAN Manager, enter the command   ```   Device(config)# platform console serial   ```   to the CLI add-on feature template. For more information on CLI Add-On Feature Templates see, [​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Systems and Interfaces Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/system-interface/ios-xe-17/systems-interfaces-book-xe-sdwan/cli-add-on-feature-template.html). This helps in avoiding Cisco SD-WAN Manager removing the serial port when the device template is attached to the device.  --- |
     | --- | --- |

     ```
     Device(config)# platform console serial
     ```
   * auto: (This option has been deprecated and is not recommended.) This option specifies that the device console is detected
     automatically. This is the default setting during the initial installation boot process. For additional information, see [Booting the Cisco CSR 1000v as the VM](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/csr1000/software/configuration/b_CSR1000v_Configuration_Guide/b_CSR1000v_Configuration_Guide_chapter_0111.html#task_1205079).
6. Exit configuration mode.

   ```
   Device(config)# end
   ```
7. Save the configuration.

   ```
   Device# write memory
   ```
8. Copy the running configuration to the startup configuration.

   ```
   Device# copy system:running-config nvram:startup-config
   ```
9. Change the device back to controller mode. Enter the following command and follow the prompts to complete the command.

   ```
   Device# controller-mode enable
   ```

   | **Note** | ---   This step reboots the device in controller mode.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

Use the following procedures to upgrade your device to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r or later images.

| **Note** | ---   Do not delete the existing image to ensure that you have a rollback option.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  If an upgrade fails, do not attempt to reactivate the new software image. Instead, remove the new software image, identify and correct any configuration settings that might have caused the failure, and try the upgrade procedure again. If the issue persists, contact Cisco for assistance.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   When upgrading to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.4.1a from Cisco IOS XE Releases 17.3.1a or earlier, we recommend that you do not make any changes to the device configuration using CLI, while a feature template is detached. Starting Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.4.1a, we use Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN assisted upgrades. In this upgrade procedure, Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN saves the device configuration before the upgrade. If the configuration on the device, that is modified using CLI is not same as on Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, then the device has inconsistent configuration after the upgrade.  For example, if you configure the BGP AS number of a device to a different value using CLI, the device can have inconsistent configuration and the upgrade fails. If the upgrade is performed when the device is in CLI mode, then you must revert the BGP AS number to the original value and then upgrade the device. Therefore, we recommend that you upgrade the device using Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.5.1a, if you are upgrading the firmware for a device on which the primary tunnel interface is a cellular interface and the backup tunnel interface is a gigabit interface, use the gigabit interface as the primary interface for the firmware upgrade.  For information about configuring the priority of a tunnel interface, see the vmanage-connection-preference command in *​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Command Reference*. An interface that is configured with a higher preference value has a higher priority.   --- |

* [Upgrade Using CLI](#upgrade-using-cli)

### Upgrade Using Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN

We recommend using Cisco SD-WAN Manager to upgrade. This keeps devices and the controller synchronized.

1. Use the Cisco SD-WAN Manager
   [upgrade and activate](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/Monitor-And-Maintain/monitor-maintain-book/maintain.html#c-Software_Upgrade-12330) procedure described in the *​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Monitor and Maintain* guide.

### Upgrade Using CLI

We recommend using Cisco SD-WAN Manager to upgrade. This keeps devices and the controller synchronized. If it is necessary to upgrade using the CLI, use the following
steps.

#### Back Up Configuration Files

Use these following steps to make configuration file copies before performing the manual upgrade process. Without these steps,
the router will lose its configuration during the upgrade.

| **Note** | ---   If the deployment is on a public cloud service, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), failure to save the configuration before upgrading manually can cause an unrecoverable loss of connectivity with the device. In contrast to a hardware device, there may be no way to gain any type of console access to the virtual router.   --- |
| --- | --- |

1. Use the following command to make a backup copy of the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN configuration:

   ```
   show running-config | redirect bootflash:/sdwan/ios.cli
   ```
2. Use the following command to make a backup copy of the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN running configuration:

   ```
   show sdwan running-config | redirect bootflash:/sdwan/sdwan.cli
   ```

#### Upgrade Procedure

1. Download the Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2 image for your device from [https://software.cisco.com](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286320954)
2. Upload the image to the device.
3. Install the new software. Example:

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software install bootflash:/isr4300-universalk9.17.2.1.SPA.bin
   ```
4. Activate the software. The device reloads when the activation is complete. Example:

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software activate 17.2.01r.9.3
   ```
5. Verify that the software is activated.

   ```
   Device# show sdwan software

## Onboard Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Hosted by a Cloud Service, Using PAYG Licensing

To onboard a Cisco Catalyst 8000V platform hosted by a cloud service, using pay as you go (PAYG) licensing, perform these steps.

You can also use Cisco Cloud onRamp for Multi-Cloud to onboard a Cisco Catalyst 8000V platform using PAYG licensing. For information to integrate public cloud infrastructure into the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN fabric, see [Cloud OnRamp Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/cloudonramp/ios-xe-17/cloud-onramp-book-xe/cloud-onramp-multi-cloud.html).

| **Note** | ---   This procedure is applicable to Cisco Catalyst 8000V hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS).   --- |
| --- | --- |

1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Devices, and click Add PAYG WAN Edges.
2. In the Add PAYG WAN Edges dialog box, enter the number of PAYG devices to onboard into Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, select the Validate check box, and click Add.

   The Task View page opens, showing the progress as Cisco SD-WAN Manager creates logical devices.

   | **Note** | ---   Validating causes Cisco SD-WAN Manager to publish the list of devices to the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Validator and Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller controllers in the network.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
3. After the Task View page shows the logical devices have been created successfully, choose Configuration > Devices to view the new logical devices on the Devices page.

   | **Note** | ---   The Chassis Number column shows the unique identifier for each logical device.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
4. For the logical devices that you have created, click … and choose Generate Bootstrap Configuration.
5. (Optional) Attach a device template to the logical devices that you have created.
6. In the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box, click Cloud-Init and then click OK.

   The Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box shows the content of the bootstrap configuration, which includes the UUID of the logical device, and includes
   the configuration details provided by the device template if you have attached one.

   | **Note** | ---   The UUID corresponds to the identifier in the Chassis Number column in the Devices table.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
7. There are different methods for loading the bootstrap configuration onto a C8000V instance on a cloud service. The method
   you use depends on the cloud service. We recommend to click Download in the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box to save a copy of the bootstrap configuration.
8. In the cloud services portal, create a PAYG instance of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V. When configuring the instance, use the bootstrap configuration that you created in Cisco SD-WAN Manager. The details of how to load the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN bootstrap configuration onto the instance are specific to the cloud services provider.

   | **Note** | ---   On AWS, the workflow for bringing up an instance includes a user data step that enables loading the bootstrap configuration.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
9. On the cloud service platform, start the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance using the bootstrap configuration from an earlier step.

   When the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance boots up, it joins the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN overlay automatically. In Cisco SD-WAN Manager, on the Devices page, this Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance shows a green medal icon in the State column and In Sync in the Device Status column.

   | **Note** | ---   On the Devices page, for logical devices that have not joined the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN overlay, the State column shows a dotted-circle icon.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

## Bootstrap Process for Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Cloud-Hosted Devices

### Before You Begin

The device template provides the configuration details that enable the device to connect to Cisco SD-WAN Manager.

If you create a logical device and then generate a bootstrap configuration without first attaching a device template, the
resulting file will include a minimal configuration. If you attach a device template to the logical device before generating
the bootstrap configuration, the resulting file will include a more complete configuration, which can be helpful in enabling
the device to connect to the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN overlay. We recommend that you attach a device template to the logical device before creating the bootstrap configuration.

This procedure is useful when onboarding a software device, such as the Cisco Catalyst 8000V, to a private cloud, such as
KVM, ESXi, or OpenStack.

### Bootstrap Process for Cisco SD-WAN Cloud-Hosted Devices

1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Devices.
2. For the logical device (includes the UUID) that you are using for a new cloud-hosted instance, click … and choose Generate Bootstrap Configuration.
3. In the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box, choose Cloud-Init and click OK. The Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box displays the bootstrap configuration, including the OTP token for the license, Cisco SD-WAN Validator address, UUID, and organization information.

   | **Note** | ---   The UUID corresponds to the identifier in the Chassis Number column in the Devices table.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

   | **Note** | ---   Ensure that the bootstrap configuration does not include more interfaces than the virtual device instance has in the cloud environment.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
4. There are different methods for loading the bootstrap configuration onto a device instance on a cloud service. The method
   you use depends on the cloud service. We recommend that you click Download in the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box to save a copy of the bootstrap configuration.

   You can use the bootstrap configuration when setting up a device instance in the cloud service. The configuration enables
   the device instance to connect to Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN.

For information about onboarding a Cisco Catalyst 8000V in a private cloud, see the following:

* [Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Installation And Configuration Guide, Installing in KVM Environments](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/C8000V/Configuration/c8000v-installation-configuration-guide/m_install_cisco_kvm_environments.html)

Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting Software Installation

### Router Loads the Previous Software Version After Booting

* [Router Loads the Previous Software Version After Booting](#router-loads-prev-ver)

### Router Loads the Previous Software Version After Booting

#### Problem

A router starts up using the previously installed software version.

#### Conditions

A router using Cisco IOS XE has two or more software versions installed.

#### Possible Causes

If the router begins booting up, and power cycles during the bootup, it may reboot using the previously installed software
version.

| **Note** | ---   Cisco IOS XE devices have a mechanism that preserves the previously installed software version. As a safeguard against getting stuck during bootup with a corrupted software image, a device can fall back to the previously installed software version. This fallback can also occur if the device experiences a power cycle during bootup. In this case (power cycle during bootup), you can reboot the device to load the latest software.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Solutions

1. Check the active and inactive system software versions for a device using one of the following procedures:

   * Cisco SD-WAN Manager procedure:

     1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Monitor > Devices.
     2. Click a device name in the Hostname column.
     3. In the left pane, click Real Time.
     4. In the Device Options field, enter Software Versions.

        A table displays the installed software versions and indicates which version is active.
   * CLI procedure:

     1. Execute the show sdwan software command in privileged EXEC mode to view the current active software version and the previous version.
     2. Execute the show version command on the device, in privileged EXEC mode.

        If the device is using the latest installed software version, the command output shows bootflash:packages.conf.

        If the device is using the previous software version, the command output shows bootflash:prev\_packages.conf.
2. Reboot the device and check the loaded system software again.
3. If the device boots again with the previous software version (bootflash:prev\_packages.conf), contact Cisco TAC for assistance.

For additional information, see the [Install and Upgrade Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r and Later](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/install-upgrade-17-2-later.html) chapter of the *Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide*. Determine the Device Configuration To determine whether a device has a vulnerable configuration, do the following:  **Check AAA Configuration**  To determine whether AAA authentication is configured on the device, use the **show running-config | include aaa authentication login** command, as shown in the following example:  ```   Router#show running-config | include aaa authentication loginaaa authentication login default local group exampleRouter#   ```  **Check NETCONF and RESTCONF Configuration**  To determine whether NETCONF or RESTCONF is configured on the device, use the **show running-config | include netconf|restconf** command, as shown in the following example:  ```   Router#show running-config | include netconf|restconfnetconf-yangrestconfRouter#   ```  **Check enable password Configuration**  To determine whether **enable password** is configured on the device without the presence of an **enable secret**, use the **show running-config | include enable password|secret** command, as shown in the following example:  ```   Router#show running-config | include enable password|secretenable password 7 00010B07094B0703Router#   ```  **Note:** If **enable secret** is being used without the presence of **enable password**, the device is not affected. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XR Software   + Meraki products   + NX-OS Software  Workarounds  * **There is a workaround that addresses this vulnerability:** Remove the **enable password** and configure an **enable secret**. For more information, see [Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc14).  **There is also a mitigation that addresses this vulnerability:** To limit the attack surface of this vulnerability, ensure that access control lists (ACLs) are in place for NETCONF and RESTCONF to prevent attempted access from untrusted subnets. For more information, see [NETCONF and RESTCONF Service-Level ACLs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/prog/configuration/1611/b_1611_programmability_cg/service_level_ACLs_NETCONF_RESTCONF.html).  While this workaround and this mitigation have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**:     By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.  Exploitation and Public Announcements  * The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.  Source  * This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.  Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy  * To learn about Cisco security vulnerability disclosure policies and publications, see the [Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Information About NETCONF and RESTCONF Service-Level ACLs

* [NETCONF/RESTCONF Service-Level ACLs](#id_96658)

### NETCONF/RESTCONF Service-Level ACLs

You can configure an IPv4 or IPv6 access control list (ACL) for NETCONF and RESTCONF sessions. Clients that do not conform
to the configured ACL are not allowed to access the NETCONF or RESTCONF subsystems. When service-level ACLs are configured,
NETCONF-YANG/RESTCONF connection requests are filtered based on the source IP address.

If no service-level ACLs are configured, all NETCONF-YANG/RESTCONF connection requests are permitted into the subsystems.

| **Note** | ---   Only named ACLs are supported; numbered ACLs are not supported.   --- |

## How to Configure NETCONF and RESTCONF Service-Level ACLs

* [Configuring an ACL for a NETCONF-YANG Session](#id_96678)
* [Configuring an ACL for a RESTCONF Session](#id_96678)

### Configuring an ACL for a NETCONF-YANG Session

You can either configure an IP access-list or an IPv6 access list for your NETCONF-YANG session.

### SUMMARY STEPS

1. enable
2. configure terminal

* ip access-list {standard | extended} access-list-name
* ipv6 access-list access-list-name

5. permit {host-address | host-name | any} [wildcard]
6. deny {host-address | host-name | any} [wildcard]
7. exit
8. netconf-yang ssh {{ipv4 | ipv6 }access-list name access-list-name} | port port-number}
9. end

### DETAILED STEPS

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | enable  Example: ``` Device> enable ``` | Enables privileged EXEC mode.   * Enter your password if prompted. |
| **Step 2** | configure terminal  Example: ``` Device# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 3** | * ip access-list {standard | extended} access-list-name * ipv6 access-list access-list-name  Example: ``` Device(config)# ip access-list standard acl1_permit  ``` ``` Device(config)# ipv6 access-list ipv6-acl1_permit ``` | Specifies a standard IP access list and enters standard access-list configuration mode.  Specifies an IPv6 access list and enters IPv6 access list configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | permit {host-address | host-name | any} [wildcard]  Example: ``` Device(config-std-nacl)# permit 192.168.255.0 0.0.0.255 ``` | Sets conditions in an IP/IPv6 access list that will permit packets. |
| **Step 5** | deny {host-address | host-name | any} [wildcard]  Example: ``` Device(config-std-nacl)# deny any  ``` | Sets conditions in an IP/IPv6 access list that will deny packets. |
| **Step 6** | exit  Example: ``` Device(config-std-nacl)# exit ``` | Exits standard access-list configuration mode and returns to global configuration mode. |
| **Step 7** | netconf-yang ssh {{ipv4 | ipv6 }access-list name access-list-name} | port port-number}  Example: ``` Device(config)# netconf-yang ssh ipv4 access-list name acl1_permit ``` | Configures an ACL for the NETCONF-YANG session. |
| **Step 8** | end  Example: ``` Device(config)# end ``` | Exits global configuration mode and returns to privileged EXEC mode. |

### Configuring an ACL for a RESTCONF Session

You can either configure an IP access-list or an IPv6 access list for your RESTCONF session.

### SUMMARY STEPS

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 9.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 9.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 9.8 |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

## Introduction

This document describes how to secure your Cisco IOS® system devices and increase the overall security of your network.

## Prerequisites

### Requirements

There are no specific requirements for this document.

### Components Used

This document is not restricted to specific software and hardware versions.

The information in this document was created from the devices in a specific lab environment. All of the devices used in this document started with a cleared (default) configuration. If your network is live, ensure that you understand the potential impact of any command.

## Background

When you secure your Cisco IOS system devices, the overall security of your network increases.

The overall security of your network is structured around the three planes into which functions of a network device can be categorized. The three functional planes of a network are: the management plane, control plane, and data plane, each plane provides different functionality that needs to be protected. This document provides an overview of each included feature and references to related documentation.

* **Management Plane** - The management plane manages traffic sent to the Cisco IOS device and is composed of applications and protocols, such as Secure Shell (SSH) and Simple Network Management Protocol (SNMP).
* **Control Plane** - The control plane of a network device processes the traffic that is paramount to maintain the functionality of the network infrastructure. The control plane consists of applications and protocols between network devices, such as the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP), as well as the Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs). Also included are the Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF).
* **Data Plane** - The data plane forwards data through a network device. The data plane does not include traffic sent to the local Cisco IOS device.

Security features covered in this document often provide enough detail for you to configure the described feature. However, where details are not available, the feature is explained in such a way that you can evaluate if additional attention to the feature is required. Where possible and appropriate, this document contains recommendations which, if implemented, help secure a network.

## Secure Operations

Secure network operations is a substantial topic. Although most of this document is devoted to the secure configuration of a Cisco IOS device, configurations alone do not completely secure a network. The operational procedures in use on the network contribute as much to security as the configuration of the underlying devices.

These topics contain operational recommendations that you are advised to implement. These topics highlight specific critical areas of network operations and are not comprehensive.

### Monitor Cisco Security Advisories and Responses

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) creates and maintains publications, commonly referred to as PSIRT Advisories, for security-related issues in Cisco products. The method used for communication of less severe issues is the Cisco Security Response. Security advisories and responses are available at [Cisco Security Advisories](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x).

Additional information about these communication vehicles is available in the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html).

To maintain a secure network, be aware of the Cisco security advisories and responses that have been released. You need to have knowledge of a vulnerability before the threat it can pose to a network can be evaluated. Refer to [Risk Triage for Security Vulnerability Announcements](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vulnerability_risk_triage.html) for assistance in this evaluation process.

### Leverage Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting

The Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework is vital to secure network devices. The AAA framework provides authentication of management sessions and can also limit users to specific, administrator-defined commands and log all commands entered by all users. See the [Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc43) section of this document for more information about how to leverage AAA.

### Centralize Log Collection and Monitor Process

To gain knowledge about present, emergent, and historic events related to security incidents, your organization must have a unified strategy for event logs and correlation. This unified strategy must leverage logs from all network devices and use pre-packaged and customizable correlation capabilities.

After centralized logs is implemented, you must develop a structured approach to log analysis and track incidents. Based on the needs of your organization, this approach can range from a simple diligent review of log data to advanced rule-based analysis.

*See* the [Logging Best Practices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc57) section of this document for more information about how to implement logs on Cisco IOS network devices.

### Use Secure Protocols When Possible

Multiple protocols are used to carry sensitive network management data. Use secure protocols whenever possible. A secure protocol choice includes the use of SSH, instead of Telnet, so authentication data and management information are encrypted. Additionally, use secure file transfer protocols when you copy configuration data. An example is the use of the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) in place of FTP or TFTP.

*See* the [Secure Interactive Management Sessions](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc33) section of this document for more information about the secure management of Cisco IOS devices.

### Gain Traffic Visibility with NetFlow

NetFlow enables you to monitor traffic flows on the network. Originally intended to export traffic information to network management applications, NetFlow can also be used to show flow information on a router. This capability allows you to see what traffic traverses the network in real time. Regardless of whether or not flow information is exported to a remote collector, you are advised to configure network devices for NetFlow so it can be used reactively if needed.

More information about this feature is available in the [Traffic Identification and Traceback](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc115) section of this document and at [Cisco IOS NetFlow.](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/ios-nx-os-software/ios-netflow/index.html)

Note: Only registered Cisco users have access to internal tools and information.

### Configuration Management

Configuration management is a process by which configuration changes are proposed, reviewed, approved, and deployed. Within the context of a Cisco IOS device configuration, two additional aspects of configuration management are critical: configuration archival and security.

Use configuration archives to roll back changes made to network devices. In a security context, configuration archives can also be used to determine which security changes were made and when these changes occurred. Together with AAA log data, this information can assist in the security audit of network devices.

The configuration of a Cisco IOS device contains many sensitive details. Usernames, passwords, and the contents of access control lists are examples of this sensitive information. The repository used to archive Cisco IOS device configurations needs to be secured. Insecure access to this information can undermine the security of the entire network.

## Management Plane

The management plane consists of functions that achieve the management goals of the network. This includes interactive management sessions that use SSH, as well as statistics-gathering with SNMP or NetFlow. When you consider the security of a network device, it is critical that the management plane is protected. If a security incident is able to undermine the functions of the management plane, it can be impossible to recover or stabilize the network.

These sections of this document detail the security features and configurations available in Cisco IOS software that help fortify the management plane.

### General Management Plane Hardening

The management plane is used to access, configure, and manage a device, as well as monitor its operations and the network on which it is deployed. The management plane receives and sends traffic for operations of these functions. Secure both the management plane and the control plane of a device, because control plane operations directly affect operations of the management plane. This protocols used by the management plane include:

* Simple Network Management Protocol
* Telnet
* Secure Shell Protocol
* File Transfer Protocol
* HyperText Transfer Protocol / Secure HyperText Transfer Protocol

* Trivial File Transfer Protocol
* Secure Copy Protocol
* TACACS+
* RADIUS
* NetFlow
* Network Time Protocol
* Syslog

Steps must be taken to ensure the survival of the management and control planes during security incidents. If either of these planes is exploited successfully, all planes can be compromised.

### Password Management

Passwords control access to resources or devices. This is accomplished through the password used to authenticate requests. When a request is received for access to a resource or device, the request is challenged for verification of the password and identity, and access can be granted, denied, or limited, based on the result. As a security best practice, passwords must be managed with a TACACS+ or RADIUS authentication server. However, a locally configured password for privileged access is still needed in the event of TACACS+ or RADIUS services failure. A device can also have other password information present within its configuration, such as an NTP key, SNMP community string, or Routing Protocol key.

The `enable secret` command is used to set the password that grants privileged administrative access to the Cisco IOS system. The **`enable secret`** command must be used, rather than the older **`enable password`** command. The **`enable password`**  command uses a weak encryption algorithm.

If no `enable secret` is set and a password is configured for the console tty line, the console password can be used to receive privileged access, even from a remote virtual tty (vty) session. This action is almost certainly unwanted and is another reason to ensure configuration of an enable secret.

The `service password-encryption` global configuration command directs the Cisco IOS software to encrypt the passwords, Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP) secrets, and similar data that are saved in its configuration file. Such encryption is useful to prevent casual observers from the observation of passwords, such as when they look at the screen over the shoulder of an administrator. However, the algorithm used by the `service password-encryption` command is a simple Vigen re cipher. The algorithm is not designed to protect configuration files against serious analysis by even slightly sophisticated attackers and must not be used for this purpose. Any Cisco IOS configuration file that contains encrypted passwords must be treated with the same care that is used for a cleartext list of those same passwords.

While this weak encryption algorithm is not used by the `enable secret` command, it is used by the `enable password` global configuration command, as well as the `password` line configuration command. This type of passwords must be eliminated and the `enable secret` command or the [Enhanced Password Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc14) feature needs to be used.

The **`enable secret`** command and the Enhanced Password Security feature use Message Digest 5 (MD5) for password hashing. This algorithm has had considerable public review and is not known to be reversible. However, the algorithm is subject to dictionary attacks. In a dictionary attack, an attacker tries every word in a dictionary or other list of candidate passwords to find a match. Therefore, configuration files must be securely stored and only shared with trusted individuals.

#### Enhanced Password Security

The feature Enhanced Password Security, introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(8)T, allows an administrator to configure MD5 hashing of passwords for the **`username`** command. Before this feature, there were two types of passwords: Type 0, which is a cleartext password, and Type 7, which uses the algorithm from the Vigen re cipher. The Enhanced Password Security feature cannot be used with protocols that require the cleartext password to be retrievable, such as CHAP.

To encrypt a user password with MD5 hashing, issue the `username secret` global configuration command.

```
!

username <name> secret <password>

!
```
#### Login Password Retry Lockout

The Login Password Retry Lockout feature, added in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(14)T, allows you to lock out a local user account after a configured number of unsuccessful login attempts. Once a user is locked out, their account is locked until you unlock it. An authorized user configured with privilege level 15 cannot be locked out with this feature. Keep the number of users with privilege level 15 to a minimum.

Note that authorized users can lock themselves out of a device if the number of unsuccessful login attempts is reached. Additionally, a malicious user can create a denial of service (DoS) condition with repeated attempts to authenticate with a valid username.

This example shows how to enable the Login Password Retry Lockout feature:

```
!

aaa new-model
aaa local authentication attempts max-fail <max-attempts>
aaa authentication login default local

!

username <name> secret <password>

!
```

This feature also applies to authentication methods, such as CHAP and Password Authentication Protocol (PAP).

#### No Service Password-Recovery

In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(14)T and later, the No Service Password-Recovery feature does not allow anyone with console access to insecurely access the device configuration and clear the password. It also does not allow malicious users to change the configuration register value and access NVRAM.

```
!

no service password-recovery

!
```

Cisco IOS software provides a password recovery procedure that relies on access to ROM Monitor Mode (ROMMON) that uses the Break key during system startup. In ROMMON, the device software can be reloaded to prompt a new system configuration that includes a new password.

The current password recovery procedure enables anyone with console access to access the device and its network. The No Service Password-Recovery feature prevents the completion of the Break key sequence and the entering of ROMMON during system startup.

If `no service password-recovery` is enabled on a device, it is recommended that an offline copy of the device configuration be saved and a configuration archival solution be implemented. If it is necessary to recover the password of a Cisco IOS device once this feature is enabled, the entire configuration is deleted.

Refer to [Secure ROMMON Configuration Example](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/obsolete/routers/cisco-3600-series-multiservice-platforms.html) for more information about this feature.

#### Disable Unused Services

As a security best practice, disable any unnecessary service. Unneeded services, especially those that use User Datagram Protocol (UDP), are infrequently used for legitimate purposes but can be used to launch DoS and other attacks that are otherwise prevented by packet filtration.

Disable the TCP and UDP small services. These services include:

* echo (port number 7)
* discard (port number 9)
* daytime (port number 13)
* chargen (port number 19)

Although abuse of the small services can be avoided or made less dangerous by anti-spoofing access lists, disable the services on any device accessible within the network. By default, the small services are disabled in Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.0 and later. In earlier software, the `no service tcp-small-servers` and `no service udp-small-servers` global configuration commands can be issued to disable them.

Additional services that must be disabled, if not used, include:

* Issue the **`no ip finger`** global configuration command to disable Finger service. By default, Cisco IOS software releases later than 12.1(5) and 12.1(5)T disable this service.
* Issue the **`no ip bootp server`** global configuration command to disable Bootstrap Protocol (BOOTP).
* In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(8)T and later, issue the **ip dhcp bootp ignore** command in global configuration mode to disable BOOTP. This leaves Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) services enabled.
* DHCP services can be disabled if DHCP relay services are not required. Issue the **no service dhcp** command in global configuration mode.
* Issue the **no mop enabled** command in interface configuration mode to disable the Maintenance Operation Protocol (MOP) service.
* Issue the **no ip domain-lookup** global configuration command to disable Domain Name System (DNS) resolution services.
* Issue the **no service pad** command in global configuration mode to disable Packet Assembler/Disassembler (PAD) service, which is used for X.25 networks.
  The HTTP server can be disabled with the **no ip http server** command in global configuration mode, and Secure HTTP (HTTPS) server can be disabled with the **no ip http secure-server** global configuration command.
  Unless Cisco IOS devices retrieve configurations from the network during startup, the **no service config** global configuration command must be used. This prevents the Cisco IOS device from an attempt to locate a configuration file on the network with TFTP.
  Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a network protocol used to discover other CDP-enabled devices for neighbor adjacency and network topology. CDP can be used by Network Management Systems (NMS) or while trouble isolation occurs. CDP must be disabled on all interfaces connected to untrusted networks. This is accomplished with the **no cdp enable** interface command. Alternatively, CDP can be disabled globally with the **no cdp run** global configuration command. Note that CDP can be used by a malicious user for reconnaissance and to map a network.
* Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) is an IEEE protocol defined in 802.1AB and is similar to CDP. However, this protocol allows interoperability between other devices that do not support CDP. LLDP must be treated in the same manner as CDP and disabled on all interfaces that connect to untrusted networks. To accomplish this, issue the **no lldp transmit** and **no lldp receive** interface configuration commands. Issue the **no lldp run** global configuration command to disable LLDP globally. LLDP can also be used by a malicious user for reconnaissance and to map a network.

* For switches that support boot from sdflash, security can be enhanced to boot from flash and disable sdflash with the “no sdflash” configuration command.

#### EXEC Timeout

To set the interval, the EXEC command interpreter waits for user input before it terminates a session, issue the **exec-timeout** line configuration command. Use the **exec-timeout** command to logout sessions on vty or tty lines that are left idle. By default, sessions are disconnected after ten minutes of inactivity.

```
!

line con 0
 exec-timeout <minutes> [seconds]
line vty 0 4
 exec-timeout <minutes> [seconds]
!
```
#### Keepalives for TCP Sessions

The **service tcp-keepalives-in** and **service tcp-keepalives-out** global configuration commands enable a device to send TCP keepalives for TCP sessions. Use this configuration to enable TCP keepalives on inbound connections to the device and outbound connections from the device. This ensures the device on the remote end of the connection is still accessible and that half-open or orphaned connections are removed from the local Cisco IOS device.

```
!

service tcp-keepalives-in
service tcp-keepalives-out
!
```
#### Management Interface Use

The management plane of a device is accessed in-band or out-of-band on a physical or logical management interface. Ideally, both in-band and out-of-band management access exists for each network device so the management plane can be accessed during network outages.

One of the most common interfaces used for in-band access to a device is the logical loopback interface. Loopback interfaces are always up, whereas physical interfaces can change state, and the interface can potentially not be accessible. It is recommended to add a loopback interface to each device as a management interface and it be used exclusively for the management plane. This allows the administrator to apply policies throughout the network for the management plane. Once the loopback interface is configured on a device, it can be used by management plane protocols, such as SSH, SNMP, and syslog, to send and receive traffic.

```
!
interface Loopback0
 ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
!
```
#### Memory Threshold Notifications

The Memory Threshold Notification feature, added in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(4)T, allows you to mitigate low-memory conditions on a device. This feature uses two methods to accomplish this: Memory Threshold Notification and Memory Reservation.

Memory Threshold Notification generates a log message to indicate that free memory on a device has fallen lower than the configured threshold. This configuration example shows how to enable this feature with the **memory free low-watermark** global configuration command. This enables a device to generate a notification when available free memory falls lower than the specified threshold, and again when available free memory rises to five percent higher than the specified threshold.

```
!

memory free low-watermark processor <threshold>
memory free low-watermark io <threshold>
!
```

Memory Reservation is used so sufficient memory is available for critical notifications. This configuration example demonstrates how to enable this feature to ensure management processes continue to function when the memory of the device is exhausted.

```
!

memory reserve critical <value>
!

```

Refer to [Memory Threshold Notifications](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/12_3t/12_3t4/feature/guide/gt_memnt.html) for more information about this feature.

#### CPU Thresholding Notification

Introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(4)T, the CPU Thresholding Notification feature allows you to detect and receive notification when the CPU load on a device crosses a configured threshold. When the threshold is crossed, the device generates and sends an SNMP trap message. Two CPU-use thresholding methods are supported on Cisco IOS software: Rising Threshold and Falling Threshold.

This example configuration shows how to enable the Rising and Falling Thresholds to trigger a CPU threshold notification message:

```
!

snmp-server enable traps cpu threshold
!

snmp-server host <host-address> <community-string> cpu
!

process cpu threshold type <type> rising <percentage> interval <seconds>
     [falling <percentage> interval <seconds>]
process cpu statistics limit entry-percentage <number> [size <seconds>]
!
```

Refer to [CPU Thresholding Notification](https://search.cisco.com/search?query=Cisco%20IOS%20Network%20Management%20Configuration%20Guide&locale=enUS&tab=Cisco) for more information about this feature.

#### Reserve Memory for Console Access

In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(15)T and later, the Reserve Memory for Console Access feature can be used to reserve enough memory to ensure console access to a Cisco IOS device for administrative and trouble isolation purposes. This feature is especially useful when the device runs low on memory. You can issue the **memory reserve console** global configuration command to enable this feature. This example configures a Cisco IOS device to reserve 4096 kilobytes for this purpose.

```
!
memory reserve console 4096
!
```
#### Memory Leak Detector

Introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(8)T1, the Memory Leak Detector feature allows you to detect memory leaks on a device. Memory Leak Detector can find leaks in all memory pools, packet buffers, and chunks. Memory leaks are static or dynamic allocations of memory that do not serve any useful purpose. This feature focuses on memory allocations that are dynamic. You can use the **show memory debug leaks** EXEC command to detect if a memory leak exists.

#### Buffer Overflow: Detection and Correction of Redzone Corruption

In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(7)T and later, the Buffer Overflow: Detection and Correction of Redzone Corruption feature can be enabled on a device to detect and correct a memory block overflow and to continue operations.

Global configuration commands can be used to enable this feature. Once configured, the **show memory overflow** command can be used to display the buffer overflow detection and correction statistics.

```
!
exception memory ignore overflow io
exception memory ignore overflow processor
!
```
#### Enhanced Crashinfo File Collection

The Enhanced Crashinfo File Collection feature automatically deletes old crashinfo files. This feature, added in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(11)T, allows a device to reclaim space to create new crashinfo files when the device crashes. This feature also allows the number of crashinfo files to be saved to be configured.

```
!
exception crashinfo maximum files <number-of-files>
!
```
#### Network Time Protocol

The Network Time Protocol (NTP) is not a dangerous service, but any unneeded service can represent an attack vector. If NTP is used, it is important to explicitly configure a trusted time source and to use proper authentication. Accurate and reliable time is required for syslog purposes, such as during forensic investigations of potential attacks, as well as for successful VPN connectivity when dependent on certificates for Phase 1 authentication.

* **NTP Time Zone** - When you configure NTP, the time zone needs to be configured so timestamps can be accurately correlated. There are two typical methods to configure the time zone for devices on a network with a global presence. One method is to configure all network devices with the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) (previously Greenwich Mean Time (GMT)). The other method is to configure network devices with the local time zone. More information on this feature can be found in “clock timezone” in the Cisco product documentation.
* **NTP Authentication** - If you configure NTP authentication, it provides assurance that NTP messages are exchanged between trusted NTP peers.

This is a sample configuration that uses NTP authentication:

**Client:**

```
(config)#ntp authenticate
(config)#ntp authentication-key 5 md5 ciscotime
(config)#ntp trusted-key 5
(config)#ntp server 172.16.1.5 key 5
```

**Server:**

```
(config)#ntp authenticate
(config)#ntp authentication-key 5 md5 ciscotime
(config)#ntp trusted-key 5
```
#### Disable Smart Install

Security best practices around the Cisco Smart Install (SMI) feature depend on how the feature is used in a specific user environment. Cisco differentiates these use cases:

* Users who do not use the the SMI feature.
* Users who leverage the SMI feature only for zero-touch deployment.
* Users who leverage the Smart InstalSMI feature for more than zero-touch deployment (configuration and image management).

These sections describe each scenario in detail:

* Users who do not use the SMI feature.
* Users who do not use the SMI feature, and run a release of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE software where the command is available, can disable the SMI feature with the **no vstack** command.

**Note**: The **vstack** command was introduced in Cisco IOS Release 12.2(55)SE03.

This is sample output from the **show vstack** command on a Cisco Catalyst Switch with the SMI client feature disabled:

```
switch# show vstack
config Role: Client (SmartInstall disabled)
Vstack Director IP address: 0.0.0.0
```
#### Customers Who Leverage the SMI Feature Only for Zero-Touch Deployment

Disable the SMI client functionality after the zero-touch installation is complete or use the **no vstack** command.

To propagate the **no vstack** command into the network, use one of these methods:

* Enter the **no vstack** command on all client switches, either manually or with a script.
* Add the **no vstack** command as part of the Cisco IOS configuration that is pushed into each SMI client as part of the zero-touch installation.
* In releases that do not support the **vstack** command (Cisco IOS Release 12.2(55)SE02 and earlier releases), apply an access control list (ACL) on client switches to block the traffic on TCP port 4786.

To enable the SMI client functionality later, enter the **vstack** command on all client switches, either manually or with a script.

#### Customers Who Leverage the SMI Feature for More Than Zero-Touch Deployment

In the design of a SMI architecture, take care so the infrastructure IP address space is not accessible to untrusted parties. In releases that do not support the **vstack** command, ensure only the SMI director has TCP connectivity to all SMI clients on port 4786.

Administrators can use these security best practices for SMI deployments on affected devices:

* Interface ACLs
* Control Plane Policing (CoPP). This feature is not available in all Cisco IOS software releases.

This example shows an interface ACL with the SMI director IP address as 10.10.10.1 and the SMI client IP address as 10.10.10.200:

```
ip access-list extended SMI_HARDENING_LIST
Permit tcp host 10.10.10.1 host 10.10.10.200 eq 4786
deny tcp any any eq 4786
permit ip any any
```

This ACL must be deployed on all IP interfaces on all clients. It can also be pushed by the director when switches are first deployed.

To further restrict access to all the clients within the infrastructure, administrators can use these security best practices on other devices on the network:

* Infrastructure access control lists (iACLs)
* VLAN access control lists (VACLs)

### Limit Access to the Network with Infrastructure ACLs

Devised to prevent unauthorized direct communication to network devices, iACLs are one of the most critical security controls implemented on networks. An iACL leverages the idea that nearly all network traffic traverses the network and is not destined to the network itself.

An iACL is constructed and applied to specify connections from hosts or networks that need to be allowed to network devices. Common examples of these connection types are eBGP, SSH, and SNMP. After the required connections have been permitted, all other traffic to the infrastructure is explicitly denied. All transit traffic that crosses the network and is not destined to infrastructure devices is then explicitly permitted.

The protections provided by iACLs are relevant to both the management and control planes. The implementation of iACLs can be made easier through the use of distinct addresses for network infrastructure devices. *Refer to* [A Security Oriented Approach to IP Addressing](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_ip_addressing.html) for more information on the security implications of IP addresses.

This example iACL configuration illustrates the structure that must be used as the start point when you begin the iACL implementation process:

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-INFRASTRUCTURE-IN
!
!--- Permit required connections for routing protocols and
!--- network management
!

 permit tcp host <trusted-ebgp-peer> host <local-ebgp-address> eq 179
 permit tcp host <trusted-ebgp-peer> eq 179 host <local-ebgp-address>
 permit tcp host <trusted-management-stations> any eq 22
 permit udp host <trusted-netmgmt-servers> any eq 161
!
!--- Deny all other IP traffic to any network device
!

 deny ip any <infrastructure-address-space> <mask>
!
!--- Permit transit traffic
!

 permit ip any any
!
```

Once created, the iACL must be applied to all interfaces that face non-infrastructure devices. This includes interfaces that connect to other organizations, remote access segments, user segments, and segments in data centers.

Refer to [Protecting Your Core: Infrastructure Protection Access Control Lists](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/43920-iacl.html) for more information about Infrastructure ACLs.

#### ICMP Packet Filtering

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) is designed as an IP control protocol. As such, the messages it conveys can have significant interaction with the TCP and IP protocols in general. While the network tools, **ping** and **traceroute**, to troubleshoot use ICMP, external ICMP connectivity is rarely needed for the proper network operation.

Cisco IOS software provides functionality to specifically filter ICMP messages by name or type and code. This example ACL, which must be used with the access control entries (ACEs) from previous examples, allows pings from trusted management stations and NMS servers and blocks all other ICMP packets:

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-INFRASTRUCTURE-IN
!
!--- Permit ICMP Echo (ping) from trusted management stations and servers
!

 permit icmp host <trusted-management-stations> any echo
 permit icmp host <trusted-netmgmt-servers> any echo
!
!--- Deny all other IP traffic to any network device
!

 deny ip any <infrastructure-address-space> <mask>
!
!--- Permit transit traffic
!

 permit ip any any
!
```
#### Filter IP Fragments

The filter process for fragmented IP packets can be a challenge for security devices. This is because the Layer 4 information used to filter TCP and UDP packets is only present in the initial fragment. Cisco IOS software uses a specific method to check non-initial fragments against configured access lists. Cisco IOS software evaluates these non-initial fragments against the ACL and ignores any Layer 4 filtered information. This causes non-initial fragments to be evaluated only on the Layer 3 portion of any configured ACE.

In this example configuration, if a TCP packet destined to **192.168.1.1** on **port 22** is fragmented in transit, the initial fragment is dropped as expected by the second ACE, based on the Layer 4 information within the packet. However, all (non-initial) fragments that remain are allowed by the first ACE, based completely on the Layer 3 information in the packet and ACE. This scenario is shown in this configuration:

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-FRAGMENT-EXAMPLE
 permit tcp any host 192.168.1.1 eq 80
 deny tcp any host 192.168.1.1 eq 22
!
```

Due to the nonintuitive nature of fragment handling, IP fragments are often inadvertently permitted by ACLs. Fragmentation is often used in attempts to evade detection by intrusion detection systems. For these reasons, IP fragments are often used in attacks, and why they must be explicitly filtered at the top of any configured iACLs. This example ACL includes comprehensive filtration of IP fragments. The functionality from this example must be used with the functionality of the previous examples.

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-INFRASTRUCTURE-IN
!
!--- Deny IP fragments using protocol-specific ACEs to aid in
!--- classification of attack traffic
!

 deny tcp any any fragments
 deny udp any any fragments
 deny icmp any any fragments
 deny ip any any fragments
!
!--- Deny all other IP traffic to any network device
!

 deny ip any <infrastructure-address-space> <mask>
!
!--- Permit transit traffic
!

 permit ip any any
!
```

Refer to [Access Control Lists and IP Fragments](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/generic-routing-encapsulation-gre/8014-acl-wp.html) for more information about how ACL handles fragmented IP packets.

#### ACL Support to Filter IP Options

Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(4)T added support for the use of ACLs to filter IP packets, based on the IP options contained in the packet. IP options present a security challenge for network devices because these options must be processed as exception packets. This requires a level of CPU effort not required for typical packets that traverse the network. The presence of IP options within a packet can also indicate an attempt to subvert security controls on the network or otherwise alter the transit characteristics of a packet. For these reasons, packets with IP options must be filtered at the edge of the network.

This example must be used with the ACEs from previous examples to include complete filtration of IP packets that contain IP options:

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-INFRASTRUCTURE-IN
!
!--- Deny IP packets containing IP options
!

 deny ip any any option any-options
!
!--- Deny all other IP traffic to any network device
!

 deny ip any <infrastructure-address-space> <mask>
!
!--- Permit transit traffic
!

 permit ip any any
!
```
#### ACL Support to Filter on TTL Value

Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(2)T added ACL support filter of IP packets, based on the Time to Live (TTL) value. The TTL value of an IP datagram is decremented by each network device as a packet flows from source to destination. Although initial values vary by the operation system, when the TTL of a packet reaches zero, the packet must be dropped. The device that decrements the TTL to zero, and therefore drops the packet, is required to generate and send an ICMP Time Exceeded message to the source of the packet.

The generation and transmission of these messages is an exception process. Routers can perform this function when the number of IP packets due to expire is low, but if the number of packets due to expire is high, generation and transmission of these messages can consume all available CPU resources. This presents a DoS attack vector. For this reason, devices need to be hardened against DoS attacks that use a high rate of IP packets, which are due to expire.

It is recommended that organizations filter IP packets with low TTL values at the edge of the network. Complete filtration of packets with TTL values insufficient to traverse the network mitigates the threat of TTL-based attacks.

This example ACL filters packets with TTL values less than six. This provides protection against TTL expiry attacks for networks up to five hops in width.

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-INFRASTRUCTURE-IN
!
!--- Deny IP packets with TTL values insufficient to traverse the network
!

 deny ip any any ttl lt 6
!
!--- Deny all other IP traffic to any network device
!

 deny ip any <infrastructure-address-space> <mask>
!
!--- Permit transit traffic
!

 permit ip any any
!
```

**Note**: Some protocols make legitimate use of packets with low TTL values. eBGP is one such protocol. Refer to [TTL Expiry Attack Identification and Mitigation](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/ttl_expiry_attack.html) for more information to mitigate TTL expiry-based attacks.

### Secure Interactive Management Sessions

Management sessions to devices provide the ability to view and collect information about a device and its operations. If this information is disclosed to a malicious user, the device can become the target of an attack, compromised, and used to perform additional attacks. Anyone with privileged access to a device has the capability for full administrative control of that device. It is imperative to secure management sessions to prevent information disclosure and unauthorized access.

#### Management Plane Protection

In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(6)T and later, the Management Plane Protection (MPP) feature allows an administrator to impose restrictions on the different interfaces management traffic that is received by a device. This allows the administrator additional control over a device and how the device is accessed.

This example shows how to enable the MPP to only allow SSH and HTTPS on the GigabitEthernet0/1 interface:

```
!

control-plane host
  management-interface GigabitEthernet 0/1 allow ssh https
!
```

Refer to [Management Plane Protection](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/obsolete/ios-nx-os-software/cisco-ios-software-release-12-4-6-t.html) for more information about MPP.

**Note**: MPP does not support IPv6 and is restricted to the IPv4 input path. Because IPv6 is not filtered, use CoPP in mixed IPv4/IPv6 environments.

#### Control Plane Protection

Control Plane Protection (CPPr) builds on the functionality of Control Plane Policing to restrict and police control plane traffic that is destined to the route processor of the Cisco IOS device. Added in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(4)T, CPPr divides the control plane into separate control plane categories, known as subinterfaces. Three control plane subinterfaces exist: Host, Transit, and CEF-Exception. Additionally, CPPr includes these control plane protection features:

* **Port-filtering feature** - Provides for the administrator to police or drop packets that go to closed or non-listening TCP and UDP ports.
* **Queue-threshold policy feature** - Limits the number of packets for a specified protocol allowed in the control plane IP input queue.

CPPr allows an administrator to classify, police, and restrict traffic sent to a device for management purposes with the host subinterface. Examples of packets classified for the host subinterface category include management traffic, such as SSH or Telnet and routing protocols.

**Note**: CPPr does not support IPv6 and is restricted to the IPv4 input path.

Refer to [Control Plane Protection Feature Guide - 12.4T](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/obsolete/ios-nx-os-software/cisco-ios-software-release-12-4-4-t.html) and [Understanding Control Plane Protection](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/qos_plcshp/configuration/15-mt/qos-plcshp-15-mt-book/qos-plcshp-cpp.html) for more information about the Cisco CPPr feature.

#### Encrypt Management Sessions

Because information can be disclosed in an interactive management session, this traffic must be encrypted so a malicious user cannot gain access to the data transmitted. Traffic encryption allows a secure remote access connection to the device. If the traffic for a management session is sent over the network in cleartext, an attacker can obtain sensitive information about the device and the network.

An administrator is able to establish an encrypted and secure remote access management connection to a device with the SSH or HTTPS (Secure Hypertext Transfer Protocol) features. Cisco IOS software supports SSH Version 1.0 (SSHv1), SSH Version 2.0 (SSHv2), and HTTPS that uses Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) for authentication and data encryption. SSHv1 and SSHv2 are not compatible. SSHv1 is insecure and not standardized, so it is not recommended to be used if SSHv2 is an option.

Cisco IOS software also supports the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP), which allows an encrypted and secure connection to copy device configurations or software images. SCP relies on SSH. This example configuration enables SSH on a Cisco IOS device:

```
!

ip domain-name example.com
!

crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
!

ip ssh time-out 60
ip ssh authentication-retries 3
ip ssh source-interface GigabitEthernet 0/1
!

line vty 0 4
 transport input ssh
!
```

This configuration example enables SCP services:

```
!

ip scp server enable
!
```

This configuration example is for HTTPS services:

```
!

crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
!

ip http secure-server
!
```

Refer to [Configuring Secure Shell on Routers and Switches Running Cisco IOS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/secure-shell-ssh/4145-ssh.html) and [Secure Shell (SSH) FAQ](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/secure-shell-ssh/19143-ssh-faq.html) for more information about the Cisco IOS software SSH feature.

#### SSHv2

The SSHv2 support feature, introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(4)T, allows a user to configure SSHv2. (SSHv1 support was implemented in an earlier release of Cisco IOS Software.) SSH runs on top of a reliable transport layer and provides strong authentication and encryption capabilities. The only reliable transport defined for SSH is TCP. SSH provides a way to securely access and securely execute commands on another computer or device over a network. The Secure Copy Protocol (SCP) feature tunneled over SSH allows the secure transfer of files.

If the  **ip ssh version 2** command is not explicitly configured, then Cisco IOS enables SSH Version 1.99. SSH Version 1.99 allows both SSHv1 and SSHv2 connections. SSHv1 is considered insecure and can have adverse effects on the system. If SSH is enabled, it is recommended to disable SSHv1 by use of the  **ip ssh version 2** command.

This example configuration enables SSHv2 (with SSHv1 disabled) on a Cisco IOS device:

```
!

hostname router

!

ip domain-name example.com

!

crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048

!

ip ssh time-out 60
ip ssh authentication-retries 3
ip ssh source-interface GigabitEthernet 0/1

!

ip ssh version 2

!

line vty 0 4
transport input ssh

!

```

Refer to [Secure Shell Version 2 Support](https://search.cisco.com/search?query=Cisco%20IOS%20Securing%20User%20Services%20Configuration%20Guide&locale=enUS&tab=Cisco) for more information on the use of SSHv2.

#### SSHv2 Enhancements for RSA Keys

Cisco IOS SSHv2 supports keyboard-interactive and password-based authentication methods. The SSHv2 Enhancements for RSA Keys feature also supports RSA-based public key authentication for the client and server.

For user authentication, RSA-based user authentication uses a private/public key pair associated with each user for authentication. The user must generate a private/public key pair on the client and configure a public key on the Cisco IOS SSH server to complete the authentication.

An SSH user who tries to establish the credentials provides an encrypted signature with the private key. The encrypted signature and the user public key are sent to the SSH server for authentication. The SSH server computes a hash over the public key provided by the user. The hash is used to determine if the server has an entry that matches. If a match is found, RSA-based message verification is performed with the public key. Hence, the user is authenticated or denied access based on the encrypted signature.

For server authentication, the Cisco IOS SSH client must assign a host key for each server. When the client tries to establish an SSH session with a server, it receives the signature of the server as part of the key exchange message. If the strict host key checking flag is enabled on the client, the client checks if it has the host key entry that corresponds to the server preconfigured. If a match is found, the client tries to validate the signature with the server host key. If the server is successfully authenticated, the session establishment continues; otherwise it is terminated and displays a **Server Authentication Failed** message.

This example configuration enables the use of RSA keys with SSHv2 on a Cisco IOS device:

```
!
! Configure a hostname for the device
!

hostname router
!
! Configure a domain name
!

ip domain-name cisco.com
!
! Specify the name of the RSA key pair (in this case, "sshkeys") to use for SSH
!

 ip ssh rsa keypair-name sshkeys
!
! Enable the SSH server for local and remote authentication on the router using
! the "crypto key generate" command
! For SSH version 2, the modulus size must be at least 768 bits
!

 crypto key generate rsa usage-keys label sshkeys modulus 2048
!
! Configure an ssh timeout (in seconds)
!
! The following enables a timeout of 120 seconds for SSH connections
!

ip ssh time-out 120
!
! Configure a limit of five (5) authentication retries
!

ip ssh authentication-retries 5
!
! Configure SSH version 2
!

ip ssh version 2
!
```

Refer to [Secure Shell Version 2 Enhancements for RSA Keys](https://search.cisco.com/search?query=Cisco%20IOS%20Securing%20User%20Services%20Configuration%20Guide&locale=enUS&tab=Cisco#wp1082562) for more information on the use of RSA keys with SSHv2.

This example configuration enables the Cisco IOS SSH server to perform RSA-based user authentication. The user authentication is successful if the RSA public key stored on the server is verified with the public or the private key pair stored on the client.

```
!
! Configure a hostname for the device
!

hostname router
!
! Configure a domain name
!

ip domain-name cisco.com
!
! Generate RSA key pairs using a modulus of 2048 bits
!

crypto key generate rsa modulus 2048
!
! Configure SSH-RSA keys for user and server authentication on the SSH server
!

ip ssh pubkey-chain
!
! Configure the SSH username
!

        username ssh-user
!
! Specify the RSA public key of the remote peer
!
! You must then configure either the key-string command
! (followed by the RSA public key of the remote peer) or the
! key-hash command (followed by the SSH key type and version.)
!
```

Refer to [Configuring the Cisco IOS SSH Server to Perform RSA-Based User Authentication](https://search.cisco.com/search?query=Cisco%20IOS%20Securing%20User%20Services%20Configuration%20Guide&locale=enUS&tab=Cisco#wp1082784) for more information on the use of RSA keys with SSHv2.

This example configuration enables the Cisco IOS SSH client to perform RSA-based server authentication.

```
!
!

hostname router
!
ip domain-name cisco.c
!
! Generate RSA key pairs
!

crypto key generate rsa
!
! Configure SSH-RSA keys for user and server authentication on the SSH server
!

!
! Enable the SSH server for public-key authentication on the router
!

        server SSH-server-name
!
! Specify the RSA public-key of the remote peer
!
! You must then configure either the key-string command
! (followed by the RSA public key of the remote peer) or the
! key-hash <key-type> <key-name> command (followed by the SSH key

#### Console and AUX Ports

In Cisco IOS devices, console and auxiliary (AUX) ports are asynchronous lines that can be used for local and remote access to a device. Be aware that console ports on Cisco IOS devices have special privileges. In particular, these privileges allow an administrator to perform the password recovery procedure. To perform password recovery, an unauthenticated attacker would need access to the console port and the ability to interrupt power to the device or to cause the device to crash.

Any method used to access the console port of a device must be secured in a manner that is equal to the security enforced for privileged access to a device. Methods used  to secure access must include the use of AAA, exec-timeout, and modem passwords (if a modem is attached to the console).

If password recovery is not required, then an administrator can remove the ability to perform the password recovery procedure through the **no service password-recovery** global configuration command; however, once the **no service password-recovery** command has been enabled, an administrator cannot perform password recovery on a device.

In most situations, the device AUX port must be disabled to prevent unauthorized access. An AUX port can be disabled with these commands:

```
!

line aux 0
 transport input none
 transport output none
 no exec
 exec-timeout 0 1
 no password
!
```
#### Control vty and tty Lines

Interactive management sessions in Cisco IOS software use a tty or virtual tty (vty). A tty is a local asynchronous line to which a terminal can be attached for local access to the device or to a modem for dialup access to a device. Note that ttys can be used for connections to console ports of other devices. This function allows a device with tty lines to act as a console server where connections can be established across the network to the console ports of devices connected to the tty lines. The tty lines for these reverse connections over the network must also be controlled.

A vty line is used for all other remote network connections supported by the device, regardless of protocol (SSH, SCP, or Telnet are examples). To ensure a device can be accessed by a local or remote management session, proper controls must be enforced on both the vty and tty lines. Cisco IOS devices have a limited number of vty lines; the number of lines available can be determined with the **show line** EXEC command. When all vty lines are in use, new management sessions cannot be established, which can create a DoS condition for access to the device.

The simplest access control to a vty or tty of a device is through the use of authentication on all lines, regardless of the device location on the network. This is critical for vty lines because they are accessible by the network. A tty line connected to a modem that is used for remote access to the device, or a tty line connected to the console port of other devices is also accessible by the network. Other forms of vty and tty access controls can be enforced with the **transport input** or **access-class** configuration commands, with the use of the CoPP and CPPr features, or if you apply access lists to interfaces on the device.

Authentication can be enforced through the use of AAA, which is the recommended method for authenticated access to a device, with the use of the local user database, or by simple password authentication configured directly on the vty or tty line.

The **exec-timeout** command must be used to logout sessions on vty or tty lines that are left idle. The **service tcp-keepalives-in** command must also be used to enable TCP keepalives on incoming connections to the device. This ensures the device on the remote end of the connection is still accessible and half-open or orphaned connections are removed from the local Cisco IOS device.

#### Control Transport for vty and tty Lines

Configure a vty and tty to accept only encrypted and secure remote access management connections to the device or through the device if it is used as a console server. This section addresses ttys because such lines can be connected to console ports on other devices, which allow the tty to be accessible over the network. To prevent information disclosure or unauthorized access to the data transmitted between the administrator and the device, use **transport input ssh** instead of clear-text protocols, such as Telnet and rlogin. The **transport input none** configuration can be enabled on a tty, which disables the use of the tty line for reverse-console connections.

Both vty and tty lines allow an administrator to connect to other devices. To limit the type of transport an administrator can use for outgoing connections, use the **transport output** line configuration command. If outgoing connections are not needed, then use **transport output none**. However, if outgoing connections are allowed, then enforce an encrypted and secure remote access method for the connection through the use of **transport output ssh**.

**Note**: IPSec can be used for encrypted and secure remote access connections to a device, if supported. If you use IPSec, it also adds additional CPU overhead to the device. However, SSH must still be enforced as the transport, even when IPSec is used.

#### Warning Banners

In some legal jurisdictions, it can be impossible to prosecute and illegal to monitor malicious users, unless they have been notified that they are not permitted to use the system. One method to provide this notification is to put this information in a banner message that is configured with the Cisco IOS software banner login command.

Legal notification requirements are complex, vary by jurisdiction and situation, and require discussion with legal counsel. Even within jurisdictions, legal opinions can differ. In cooperation with counsel, a banner can provide some or all of this information:

* Notice that the system is to be logged into or used only by specifically authorized personnel and perhaps information about who can authorize use.
* Notice that any unauthorized use of the system is unlawful and can be subject to civil and criminal penalties.
* Notice that any use of the system can be logged or monitored without further notice and that the resultant logs can be used as evidence in court.
* Specific notices required by local laws.

From a security point of view, rather than legal, a login banner must not contain any specific information about the router name, model, software, or ownership. This information can be abused by malicious users.

### Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting

The Authentication, Authorization, and Accounting (AAA) framework is critical to secure interactive access to network devices. The AAA framework provides a highly configurable environment that can be tailored, based on the needs of the network.

#### TACACS+ Authentication

TACACS+ is an authentication protocol Cisco IOS devices can use for authentication of management users against a remote AAA server. These management users can access the Cisco IOS device by SSH, HTTPS, telnet, or HTTP.

TACACS+ authentication, or more generally AAA authentication, provides the ability to use individual user accounts for each network administrator. When you do not depend on a single shared password, the security of the network is improved and your accountability is strengthened.

RADIUS is a protocol similar in purpose to TACACS+; however, it only encrypts the password sent across the network. In contrast, TACACS+ encrypts the entire TCP payload, which includes both the username and password. For this reason, use TACACS+ instead of RADIUS when TACACS+ is supported by the AAA server. Refer to [TACACS+ and RADIUS Comparison](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/security-vpn/remote-authentication-dial-user-service-radius/13838-10.html) for a more detailed comparison of these two protocols.

TACACS+ authentication can be enabled on a Cisco IOS device with a configuration similar to this example:

```
!

aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+
!

tacacs-server host <ip-address-of-tacacs-server>
tacacs-server key <key>
!
```

The previous configuration can be used as the start point for an organization-specific AAA authentication template.

A method list is a sequential list that describes the authentication methods to be queried to authenticate a user. Method lists enable you to designate one or more security protocols to be used for authentication, and thus ensure a backup system for authentication if the initial method fails. Cisco IOS software uses the first listed method that successfully accepts or rejects a user. Subsequent methods are only attempted if earlier methods fail due to server unavailability or incorrect configuration.

#### Authentication Fallback

If all configured TACACS+ servers become unavailable, then a Cisco IOS device can rely on secondary authentication protocols. Typical configurations include the use of local or enable authentication if all configured TACACS+ servers are unavailable.

The complete list of options for on-device authentication includes enable, local, and line. Each option has advantages. The use of the `enable secret` is preferred because the secret is hashed with a one-way algorithm that is inherently more secure than the encryption algorithm used with the Type 7 passwords for line or local authentication.

However, on Cisco IOS software releases that support the use of secret passwords for locally defined users, fallback to local authentication can be desirable. This allows a locally defined user to be created for one or more network administrators. If TACACS+ was completely unavailable, each administrator can use their local username and password. Although this action does enhance the accountability of network administrators in TACACS+ outages, it significantly increases the administrative burden because local user accounts on all network devices must be maintained.

This configuration example builds on the previous TACACS+ authentication example to include fallback authentication to the password configured locally with the `enable secret` command:

```
!

enable secret <password>
!

aaa new-model
aaa authentication login default group tacacs+ enable
!

tacacs-server host <ip-address-of-tacacs-server>
tacacs-server key <key>
!
```
#### Use of Type 7 Passwords

Originally designed to allow quick decryption of stored passwords, Type 7 passwords are not a secure form of password storage. There are many tools available to easily decrypt these passwords. Avoid the use of Type 7 passwords unless required by a feature in use on the Cisco IOS device.

Use type 9 (scrypt) whenever possible:

```
username <username> privilege 15 algorithm-type scrypt secret <secret>
```

Removal of passwords of this type can be performed by AAA authentication and the use of the [Enhanced Password Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc14) feature, which allows secret passwords to be used with users locally defined by the `username` global configuration command. If you cannot fully prevent the use of Type 7 passwords, consider these passwords obfuscated, not encrypted.

For more information about the removal of Type 7 passwords see the [General Management Plane Hardening](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc12) section.

#### TACACS+ Command Authorization

Command authorization with TACACS+ and AAA provides a mechanism that permits or denies each command that is entered by an administrative user. When the user enters EXEC commands, Cisco IOS sends each command to the configured AAA server. The AAA server uses its configured policies to permit or deny the command for that particular user.

This configuration can be added to the previous AAA authentication example to implement command authorization:

```
!

aaa authorization exec default group tacacs none
aaa authorization commands 0 default group tacacs none
aaa authorization commands 1 default group tacacs none
aaa authorization commands 15 default group tacacs none
!
```
#### TACACS+ Command Accounting

When configured, AAA command accounting sends information about each EXEC command entered to the configured TACACS+ servers. The information sent to the TACACS+ server includes the command executed, the date it was executed, and the username of who entered the command. Command accounting is not supported with RADIUS.

This example configuration enables AAA command accounting for EXEC commands entered at privilege levels zero, one, and 15. This configuration builds on previous examples that include configuration of the TACACS servers.

```
!

aaa accounting exec default start-stop group tacacs
aaa accounting commands 0 default start-stop group tacacs
aaa accounting commands 1 default start-stop group tacacs
aaa accounting commands 15 default start-stop group tacacs
!
```
#### Redundant AAA Servers

The AAA servers that are leveraged in an environment can be redundant and deployed in a fault-tolerant manner. This helps ensure that interactive management access, such as SSH, is possible if an AAA server is unavailable.

When you design or implement a redundant AAA server solution, remember these considerations:

* Availability of AAA servers at the time of potential network failures
* Geographically dispersed placement of AAA servers
* Load on individual AAA servers in steady-state and failure conditions
* Network latency between Network Access Servers and AAA servers
* AAA server databases synchronization

Refer to [Deploy the Access Control Servers](https://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/net_mgmt/cisco_secure_access_control_server_for_windows/4.1/configuration/guide/deploy.html) for more information.

### Fortify the Simple Network Management Protocol

This section highlights several methods that can be used to secure the SNMP deployment in Cisco IOS devices. It is critical that SNMP is properly secured to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of both the network data and the network devices through which the data transits. SNMP provides a wealth of information on the health of network devices. Protect this information from malicious users that want to leverage this data to perform attacks against the network.

#### SNMP Community Strings

Community strings are passwords applied to a Cisco IOS device to restrict access, both read-only and read-write access, to the SNMP data on the device. These community strings, as with all passwords, are carefully chosen to ensure they are not trivial. Change community strings at regular intervals and in accordance with network security policies. For example, change the strings when a network administrator changes roles or leaves the company.

These configuration lines configure a read-only community string of READONLY and a read-write community string of READWRITE:

```
!

snmp-server community READONLY RO
snmp-server community READWRITE RW
!
```

**Note**: The previous community string examples were chosen to clearly explain the use of these strings. For production environments, choose community strings with caution and include a series of alphabetical, numerical, and non-alphanumeric symbols in them.

Refer to [Cisco IOS SNMP Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/mcl/allreleasemcl/all-book.html) for more information about this feature.

#### SNMP Community Strings with ACLs

In addition to the community string, apply an ACL that further restricts SNMP access to a select group of source IP addresses. This configuration restricts SNMP read-only access to end host devices that reside in the 192.168.100.0/24 address space and restricts SNMP read-write access to only the end host device at 192.168.100.1.

**Note**: The devices permitted by these ACLs require the proper community string to access the requested SNMP information.

```
!

access-list 98 permit 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255
access-list 99 permit 192.168.100.1
!

snmp-server community READONLY RO 98
snmp-server community READWRITE RW 99
!
```

Refer to [snmp-server community](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/mcl/allreleasemcl/all-book.html#wp1016011) in the Cisco IOS Network Management Command Reference for more information about this feature.

#### Infrastructure ACLs

Infrastructure ACLs (iACLs) can be deployed to ensure that only end hosts with trusted IP addresses can send SNMP traffic to a Cisco IOS device. Ideally, an iACL contains a policy that denies unauthorized SNMP packets on UDP port 161.

See the [Limiting Access to the Network with Infrastructure ACLs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#limitaccess) section of this document for more information on the use of iACLs.

#### SNMP Views

SNMP Views are a security feature that can permit or deny access to certain SNMP MIBs. Once a view is created and applied to a community string with the **snmp-server community** community-string view global configuration commands, if you access MIB data, you are restricted to the permissions that are defined by the view. When appropriate, use views to limit users of SNMP to the data they require.

This configuration example restricts SNMP access with the community string LIMITED to the MIB data that is located in the system group:

```
!

snmp-server view VIEW-SYSTEM-ONLY system include
!

snmp-server community LIMITED view VIEW-SYSTEM-ONLY RO
!
```

Refer to [Configuring SNMP Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/snmp/configuration/12-4t/snmp-12-4t-book/nm-snmp-cfg-snmp-support.html) for more information.

#### SNMP Version 3

SNMP Version 3 (SNMPv3) is defined by [RFC3410](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3410.txt),  [RFC3411](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3411.txt),  [RFC3412](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3412.txt),  [RFC3413](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3413.txt),  [RFC3414](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3414.txt),  and [RFC3415](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3415.txt)  and is an interoperable standards-based protocol for network management. SNMPv3 provides secure access to devices because it authenticates and optionally encrypts packets over the network. Where supported, SNMPv3 can be used to add another layer of security when you deploy SNMP. SNMPv3 consists of three primary configuration options:

* **no auth** - This mode does not require any authentication or any encryption of SNMP packets
* **auth** - This mode requires authentication of the SNMP packet without encryption
* **priv** - This mode requires both authentication and encryption (privacy) of each SNMP packet

An authoritative engine ID must exist to use the SNMPv3 security mechanisms - authentication or authentication and encryption - to handle SNMP packets; by default, the engine ID is generated locally. The engine ID can be displayed with the `show snmp engineID` command as shown in this example:

```
router#show snmp engineID
   Local SNMP engineID: 80000009030000152BD35496
   Remote Engine ID          IP-addr    Port
```

**Note**: If the engineID is changed, all SNMP user accounts must be reconfigured.

The next step is to configure an SNMPv3 group. This command configures a Cisco IOS device for SNMPv3 with an SNMP server group AUTHGROUP and enables only authentication for this group with the **auth** keyword:

```
!
snmp-server group AUTHGROUP v3 auth
!
```

This command configures a Cisco IOS device for SNMPv3 with an SNMP server group PRIVGROUP and enables both authentication and encryption for this group with the **priv** keyword:

```
!
snmp-server group PRIVGROUP v3 priv
!
```

This command configures an SNMPv3 user snmpv3user with an MD5 authentication password of `authpassword` and a 3DES encryption password of `privpassword`:

```
!

snmp-server user snmpv3user PRIVGROUP v3 auth md5 authpassword priv 3des
     privpassword
!
```

Know that `snmp-server user` configuration commands are not displayed in the configuration output of the device as required by [RFC 3414](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3414.txt). Therefore, the user password is not viewable from the configuration. To view the configured users, enter the `show snmp user` command, as shown in this example:

```
router#show snmp user
User name: snmpv3user
Engine ID: 80000009030000152BD35496
storage-type: nonvolatile        active
Authentication Protocol: MD5
Privacy Protocol: 3DES
Group-name: PRIVGROUP
```

Refer to [Configuring SNMP Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/snmp/configuration/12-4t/snmp-12-4t-book/nm-snmp-cfg-snmp-support.html) for more information about this feature.

#### Management Plane Protection

The Management Plane Protection (MPP) feature in Cisco IOS software can be used to help secure SNMP because it restricts the interfaces through which SNMP traffic can terminate on the device. The MPP feature allows an administrator to designate one or more interfaces as management interfaces. Management traffic is permitted to enter a device only through these management interfaces. After MPP is enabled, no interfaces except designated management interfaces accept network management traffic that is destined to the device.

The MPP is a subset of the CPPr feature and requires a version of Cisco IOS that supports CPPr. Refer to [Understanding Control Plane Protection](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/qos_plcshp/configuration/15-mt/qos-plcshp-15-mt-book/qos-plcshp-cpp.html) for more information on CPPr.

In this example, MPP is used to restrict SNMP and SSH access to only the FastEthernet 0/0 interface:

```
!
control-plane host
 management-interface FastEthernet0/0 allow ssh snmp
!
```

Refer to [Management Plane Protection Feature Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/obsolete/ios-nx-os-software/cisco-ios-software-release-12-4-6-t.html) for more information.

### Logging Best Practices

Event logs provide visibility into a Cisco IOS device operation and the network on which it is deployed. Cisco IOS software provides several flexible log configuratopm options that can help achieve the network management and visibility goals of an organization.

These sections provide some basic log feature best practices that can help an administrator leverage log functions successfully, with minimal impact to the log feature on a Cisco IOS device.

####

#### Send Logs to a Central Location

You are advised to send log information to a remote syslog server. This makes it possible to correlate and audit network and security events across network devices more effectively. Note that syslog messages are transmitted unreliably by UDP and in cleartext. Therefore, any protections a network affords to management traffic (for example, encryption or out-of-band access) can be extended to include syslog traffic.

This example configures a Cisco IOS device to send log information to a remote syslog server:

```
!
logging host <ip-address>
!
```

Refer to [Identifying Incidents Using Firewall and Cisco IOS Router Syslog Events](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/identify_incidents_via_syslog#2) for more information on log correlation.

Integrated in Cisco IOS 12.4(15)T and originally introduced in 12.0(26)S, the Logging to Local Nonvolatile Storage (ATA Disk) feature enables system log messages to be saved on an advanced technology attachment (ATA) flash disk. Messages saved on an ATA drive persist after a router is rebooted.

These configuration lines configure 134,217,728 bytes (128 MB) of log messages to the syslog directory of the ATA flash (disk0), with a specified file size of 16,384 bytes:

```
logging buffered
logging persistent url disk0:/syslog size 134217728 filesize 16384
```

Before log messages are written to a file on the ATA disk, Cisco IOS Software checks to determine if there is sufficient disk space. If not, the oldest log file message (by timestamp) is deleted, and the current file is saved. The filename format is `log_month:day:year::time`.

**Note**: An ATA flash drive has limited disk space and thus needs to be maintained to avoid the possibiloity to overwrite stored data.

This example shows how to copy log messages from the router ATA flash disk to an external disk on FTP server 192.168.1.129 as part of maintenance procedures:

```
copy disk0:/syslog ftp://myuser/mypass@192.168.1.129/syslog
```

Refer to [Logging to Local Nonvolatile Storage (ATA Disk)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/12_2sb/feature/guide/cs_sysls.html) for more information about this feature.

#### Logging Level

Each log message generated by a Cisco IOS device is assigned one of eight severities that range from level 0, Emergencies, through level 7, Debug. Unless specifically required, you are advised to avoid logs at level 7. Logs at level 7 produce an elevated CPU load on the device, which can lead to device and network instability.

The global configuration command `logging trap` level is used to specify which log messages are sent to remote syslog servers. The level specified indicates the lowest severity message that is sent. For buffered logs, the `logging buffered` level command is used.

This configuration example limits log messages sent to remote syslog servers and the local log buffer to severities 6 (Informational) through 0 (Emergencies):

```
!

logging trap 6
logging buffered 6
!
```

Refer to [Troubleshooting, Fault Management, and Logging](https://search.cisco.com/search?query=Cisco%20IOS%20Network%20Management%20Configuration%20Guide&locale=enUS&tab=Cisco) for more information.

#### Do Not Log to Console or Monitor Sessions

With Cisco IOS software, it is possible to send log messages to monitor sessions, which are interactive management sessions in which the EXEC command `terminal monitor` has been issued, and to the console. However, this can elevate the CPU load of a Cisco IOS device and thus is not recommended. Instead, send log information to the local log buffer that can be viewed with the `show logging` command.

Use the global configuration commands `no logging console` and `no logging monitor` to disable logs to the console and monitor sessions. This configuration example shows the use of these commands:

```
!

no logging console
no logging monitor
!
```

Refer to [Cisco IOS Network Management Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/mcl/allreleasemcl/all-book.html) for more information about global configuration commands.

#### Use Buffered Logs

Cisco IOS software supports the use of a local log buffer so an administrator can view locally generated log messages. The use of buffered logs is highly recommended versus logs to either the console or monitor sessions.

There are two relevant configuration options when you configure buffered logs: the log buffer size and the message severities stored in the buffer. The size of the `logging buffer` is configured with the global configuration command `logging buffered size.` The lowest severity included in the buffer is configured with the log buffered severity command. An administrator is able to view the contents of the log buffer through the `show logging` EXEC command.

This configuration example includes the configuration of a log buffer of 16,384 bytes, as well as a severity of 6, Informational, which indicates that messages at levels 0 (Emergencies) through 6 (Informational) are stored:

```
!

logging buffered 16384 6
!
```

Refer to [Cisco IOS Network Management Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/mcl/allreleasemcl/all-book.html) for more information about buffered logs.

#### Configure Logging Source Interface

To provide an increased level of consistency when you collect and review log messages, you are advised to statically configure a logging source interface. This is accomplished by the `logging source-interface` interface command. A statically configured logging source interface ensures the same IP address appears in all log messages sent from an individual Cisco IOS device. For added stability, use a loopback interface as the log source.

This configuration example illustrates the use of the `logging source-interface` interface global configuration command to specify the IP address of the loopback 0 interface be used for all log messages:

```
!
logging source-interface Loopback 0
!
```

Refer to the [Cisco IOS Command Reference](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/mcl/allreleasemcl/all-book.html) for more information.

#### Configure Log Timestamps

The configuration of log timestamps helps to correlate events across network devices. It is important to implement a correct and consistent log timestamp configuration to ensure you can correlate log data. Configure log timestamps to include the date and time, with millisecond precision, and to include the time zone in use on the device.

This example includes the configuration of log timestamps, with millisecond precision, within the Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) zone:

```
!
service timestamps log datetime msec show-timezone
!
```

If you prefer not to log times relative to UTC, you can configure a specific local time zone and configure that information to be present in generated log messages. This example shows a device configuration for the Pacific Standard Time (PST) zone:

```
!

clock timezone PST -8
service timestamps log datetime msec localtime show-timezone
!
```
### Cisco IOS Software Configuration Management

Cisco IOS software includes several features to enable a form of configuration management on a Cisco IOS device. Such features include functionality to archive configurations and to rollback the configuration to a previous version, as well as create a detailed configuration change log.

#### Configuration Replace and Configuration Rollback

In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(7)T and later, the Configuration Replace and Configuration Rollback features allow you to archive the Cisco IOS device configuration on the device. Stored manually or automatically, the configurations in this archive can be used to replace the current running configuration with the `configure replace` filename command. This is in contrast to the `copy` filename `running-config` command. The `configure replace` filename command replaces the running configuration, as opposed to the merge performed by the `copy` command.

You are advised to enable this feature on all Cisco IOS devices on the network. Once enabled, an administrator can cause the current running configuration to be added to the archive with the `archive config EXEC` command. The archived configurations can be viewed with the `show archive EXEC` command.

This example illustrates the configuration for automatic configuration archive. This example instructs the Cisco IOS device to store archived configurations as files named archived-config-N on the disk0: file system, to maintain a maximum of 14 backups, and to archive once per day (1440 minutes) when an administrator issues the `write memory EXEC` command.

```
!

archive
 path disk0:archived-config
 maximum 14
 time-period 1440
 write-memory
!
```

Although the configuration archive function can store up to 14 backup configurations, you are advised to consider the space requirements before you use the `maximum` command.

#### Exclusive Configuration Change Access

Added to Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(14)T, the Exclusive Configuration Change Access feature ensures only one administrator makes configuration changes to a Cisco IOS device at a given time. This feature helps eliminate the undesirable impact of simultaneous changes made to related configuration components. This feature is configured with the global configuration command `configuration mode exclusive` mode and operates in one of two modes: auto or manual. In auto-mode, the configuration automatically locks when an administrator issues the `configure terminal EXEC` command. In manual mode, the administrator uses the `configure terminal lock` command to lock the configuration when it enters configuration mode.

This example illustrates the configuration of this feature for automatic configuration locking:

```
!
configuration mode exclusive auto
!
```
#### Cisco IOS Software Resilient Configuration

Added in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(8)T, the Resilient Configuration feature makes it possible to securely store a copy of the Cisco IOS software image and device configuration currently used by a Cisco IOS device. When this feature is enabled, it is not possible to alter or remove these backup files. You are advised to enable this feature to prevent both inadvertent and malicious attempts to delete these files.

```
!
secure boot-image
secure boot-config!
```

Once this feature is enabled, it is possible to restore a deleted configuration or Cisco IOS software image. The current state of this feature can be displayed with the `show secure boot EXEC` command.

#### Digitally Signed Cisco Software

Added in Cisco IOS Software Release 15.0(1)M for the Cisco 1900, 2900, and 3900 Series routers, the Digitally Signed Cisco Software feature facilitates use of Cisco IOS Software that is digitally signed and thus trusted, with the use of secure asymmetrical (public-key) cryptography.

A digitally signed image carries an encrypted (with a private key) hash of itself. Upon check, the device decrypts the hash with the associated public key from the keys it has in its key store and also calculates its own hash of the image. If the decrypted hash matches the calculated image hash, the image has not been tampered with and can be trusted.

Digitally signed Cisco software keys are identified by the type and version of the key. A key can be a special, production, or rollover key type. Production and special key types have an associated key version that increments alphabetically when the key is revoked and replaced. ROMMON and regular Cisco IOS images are both signed with a special or production key when you use the Digitally Signed Cisco Software feature. The ROMMON image is upgradable and must be signed with the same key as the special or production image that is loaded.

This command verifies the integrity of image c3900-universalk9-mz.SSA in flash with the keys in the device key store:

```
show software authenticity file flash0:c3900-universalk9-mz.SSA
```

The Digitally Signed Cisco Software feature was also integrated in Cisco IOS XE Release 3.1.0.SG for the Cisco Catalyst 4500 E-Series Switches.

Refer to [Digitally Signed Cisco Software](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/fundamentals/configuration/guide/TIPs_Conversion/lmsi_15_1s_book/cf_dgtly_sgnd_sw.html) for more information about this feature.

In Cisco IOS Software Release 15.1(1)T and later, Key Replacement for Digitally Signed Cisco Software was introduced. Key Replacement and revocation replaces and removes a key that is used for a Digitally Signed Cisco Software check from the platform key storage. Only special and production keys can be revoked in the event of a key compromise.

A new (special or production) key for a (special or production) image comes in a (production or revocation) image that is used to revoke the previous special or production key. The revocation image integrity is verified with a rollover key that comes prestored on the platform. A rollover key does not change. When you revoke a production key, after the revocation image is loaded, the new key it carries is added to the key store and the associated old key can be revoked, as long as the ROMMON image is upgraded and the new production image is booted. When you revoke a special key, a production image is loaded. This image adds the new special key and can revoke the old special key. After you upgrade ROMMON, the new special image can be booted.

This example describes revocation of a special key. These commands add the new special key to the key store from the current production image, copies a new ROMMON image (C3900\_rom-monitor.srec.SSB) to the storage area (usbflash0:), upgrades the ROMMON file, and revokes the old special key:

```
software authenticity key add special
copy tftp://192.168.1.129/C3900_rom-monitor.srec.SSB usbflash0:
upgrade rom-monitor file usbflash0:C3900_PRIV_RM2.srec.SSB
software authenticity key revoke special
```

A new special image (c3900-universalk9-mz.SSB) can then be copied to the flash to be loaded and the signature of the image is verified with the newly added special key (.SSB):

```
copy /verify tftp://192.168.1.129/c3900-universalk9-mz.SSB flash:
```

Key revocation and replacement is not supported on Catalyst 4500 E-Series Switches that run Cisco IOS XE Software, although these switches do support the Digitally Signed Cisco Software feature.

Refer to the [Digitally Signed Cisco Software Key Revocation and Replacement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/fundamentals/configuration/guide/TIPs_Conversion/lmsi_15_1s_book/cf_dgtly_sgnd_sw.html#wp10764844) section of the [Digitally Signed Cisco Software](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/fundamentals/configuration/guide/TIPs_Conversion/lmsi_15_1s_book/cf_dgtly_sgnd_sw.html) guide for more information about this feature.

#### Configuration Change Notification and Logging

The Configuration Change Notification and Logging feature, added in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(4)T, makes it possible to log the configuration changes made to a Cisco IOS device. The log is maintained on the Cisco IOS device and contains the user information of the individual who made the change, the configuration command entered, and the time the change was made. This functionality is enabled with the `logging enable` configuration change logger configuration mode command. The optional commands `hidekeys` and `logging size` entries are used to improve the default configuration because they prevent logs of password data and increase the length of the change log.

You are advised to enable this functionality so the configuration change history of a Cisco IOS device can be more easily understood. Additionally, you are advised to use the `notify syslog` configuration command to enable the generation of syslog messages when a configuration change is made.

```
!

archive
 log config
  logging enable
  logging size 200
  hidekeys
  notify syslog
!
```

After the Configuration Change Notification and Logging feature has been enabled, the privileged EXEC command `show archive log config all` can be used to view the configuration log.

## Control Plane

Control plane functions consist of the protocols and processes that communicate between network devices to move data from source to destination. This includes routing protocols, such as Border Gateway Protocol, as well as protocols such as ICMP and Resource Reservation Protocol (RSVP).

It is important that events in the management and data planes do not adversely affect the control plane. If a data plane event, such as a DoS attack impact the control plane, the entire network can become unstable. This information about Cisco IOS software features and configurations can help ensure the resilience of the control plane.

### General Control Plane Hardening

Protection of the control plane of a network device is critical because the control plane ensures the management and data planes are maintained and operational. If the control plane becomes unstable during a security incident, it can be impossible to recover the stability of the network.

In many cases, you can disable the reception and transmission of certain message types on an interface to minimize the amount of CPU load required to process unneeded packets.

#### IP ICMP Redirects

An ICMP redirect message can be generated by a router when a packet is received and transmitted on the same interface. In this situation, the router forwards the packet and sends an ICMP redirect message back to the sender of the original packet. This behavior allows the sender to bypass the router and forward future packets directly to the destination (or to a router closer to the destination). In a properly functioning IP network, a router sends redirects only to hosts on its own local subnets. In other words, ICMP redirects typically never go beyond a Layer 3 boundary.

There are two types of ICMP redirect messages: redirect for a host address and redirect for an entire subnet. A malicious user can exploit the ability of the router to send ICMP redirects by continupus transmission of packets to the router, which forces the router to respond with ICMP redirect messages, and results in an adverse impact on the CPU and performance of the router. To prevent the router from transmission of ICMP redirects, use the `no ip redirects` interface configuration command.

#### ICMP Unreachables

Filtration with an interface access list elicits the transmission of ICMP unreachable messages back to the source of the filtered traffic. Generation of these messages can increase CPU use on the device. By default, in Cisco IOS software, ICMP unreachable generation is limited to one packet every 500 milliseconds. ICMP unreachable message generation can be disabled with the interface configuration command `no ip unreachables`. The ICMP unreachable rate limit can be changed from the default with the global configuration command `ip icmp rate-limit unreachable` interval-in-ms.

#### Proxy ARP

Proxy ARP is the technique in which one device, usually a router, answers ARP requests intended for another device. By falsification of its identity, the router accepts responsibility to route packets to the real destination. Proxy ARP can help machines on a subnet reach remote subnets without route configuration or a default gateway. Proxy ARP is defined in [RFC 1027](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1027.txt) .

There are disadvantages to proxy ARP use. It can result in an increase in the amount of ARP traffic on the network segment and resource exhaustion and man-in-the-middle attacks. Proxy ARP presents a resource exhaustion attack vector because each proxied ARP request consumes a small amount of memory. An attacker can exhaust all available memory if they send a large number of ARP requests.

Man-in-the-middle attacks enable a host on the network to spoof the MAC address of the router, which results in hosts inadvertant transmission of traffic to the attacker. Proxy ARP can be disabled with the interface configuration command `no ip proxy-arp.`

### Limit CPU Impact of Control Plane Traffic

Protection of the control plane is critical. Because application performance and end-user experience can suffer without the presence of data and management traffic, the survivability of the control plane ensures the other two planes are maintained and operational.

#### Understand Control Plane Traffic

To properly protect the control plane of the Cisco IOS device, it is essential to understand the traffic types that are process switched by the CPU. Process switched traffic normally consists of two different traffic types. The first traffic type is directed to the Cisco IOS device and must be handled directly by the Cisco IOS device CPU. This traffic consists of the *Receive adjacency traffic* category. This traffic contains an entry in the Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) table, whereby the next router hop is the device itself, which is indicated by the term receive in the `show ip cef` CLI output. This indication is the case for any IP address that requires direct handling by the Cisco IOS device CPU, which includes interface IP addresses, multicast address space, and broadcast address space.

The second traffic type handled by the CPU is data plane traffic - traffic with a destination beyond the Cisco IOS device itself, which requires special processing by the CPU. Although not an exhaustive list of CPU impacts of data plane traffic, these traffic types are process switched and can therefore affect the control plane operation:

* **Access Control List logging** - ACL log traffic consists of any packets generated due to a match (permit or deny) of an ACE on which the log keyword is used.
* **Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding (Unicast RPF)** - Unicast RPF, used with an ACL, can result in the process switching of certain packets.
* **IP Options** - Any IP packets with options included must be processed by the CPU.
* **Fragmentation** - Any IP packet that requires fragmentation must be passed to the CPU to be processed.
* **Time-to-live (TTL) Expiry** - Packets with a TTL value less than or equal to one require Internet Control Message Protocol Time Exceeded (ICMP Type 11, Code 0) messages to be sent, which results in CPU processing.
* **ICMP Unreachables** - Packets that result in ICMP unreachable messages due to their route, MTU, or filtration are processed by the CPU.
* **Traffic that Requires an ARP Request** - Destinations for which an ARP entry does not exist are processed by the CPU.
* **Non-IP Traffic** - All non-IP traffic is processed by the CPU.

This list details several methods to determine which traffic types are to be processed by the Cisco IOS device CPU:

* The `show ip cef` command provides the next-hop information for each IP prefix contained in the CEF table. As indicated previously, entries that contain receive as the "Next Hop" are considered receive adjacencies and indicate that traffic must be sent directly to the CPU.
* The `show interface switching` command provides information on the number of packets that are process switched by a device.
* The `show ip traffic` command provides information on the number of IP packets:

  + with a local destination (that is, receive adjacency traffic)
  + with options
  + that require fragmentation
  + that are sent to broadcast address space
  + that are sent to multicast address space
* Receive adjacency traffic can be identified through the use of the **show ip cache flow** command. Any flows destined to the Cisco IOS device has a Destination Interface (DstIf) of local.
* **Control Plane Policing** can be used to identify the type and rate of traffic that reaches the control plane of the Cisco IOS device. Control plane policing can be performed through the use of granular classification ACLs, logs, and the `show policy-map control-plane` command.

#### Infrastructure ACLs

Infrastructure ACLs (iACLs) limit external communication to the devices of the network. The iACLs are extensively covered in the [Limit Access to the Network with Infrastructure ACLs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc28) section of this document.

You are advised to implement iACLs to protect the control plane of all network devices.

#### Receive ACLs

For distributed platforms, Receive ACLs (rACLs) can be an option for Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.0(21)S2 for the 12000 (GSR), 12.0(24)S for the 7500, and 12.0(31)S for the 10720. The rACL protects the device from harmful traffic before the traffic impacts the route processor. The rACLs are designed to only protect the device on which it is configured and transit traffic is not affected by an rACL. As a result, the destination IP address "any" used in the example ACL entries shown, only refers to the physical or virtual IP addresses of the router. The rACLs are also considered a network security best practice and can be considered as a long-term addition to good network security.

This is the receive path ACL that is written to permit SSH (TCP port 22) traffic from trusted hosts on the 192.168.100.0/24 network:

```
!
!--- Permit SSH from trusted hosts allowed to the device.
!

access-list 151 permit tcp 192.168.100.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 22
!
!--- Deny SSH from all other sources to the RP.
!

access-list 151 deny tcp any any eq 22
!
!--- Permit all other traffic to the device.
!--- according to security policy and configurations.
!

access-list 151 permit ip any any
!
!--- Apply this access list to the receive path.
!

ip receive access-list 151
!
```

Refer to [GSR: Receive Access Control Lists](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/43861-racl.html) to help identify and allow legitimate traffic to a device and deny all unwanted packets.

#### CoPP

The CoPP feature can also be used to restrict IP packets destined to the infrastructure device. In this example, only SSH traffic from trusted hosts is permitted to reach the Cisco IOS device CPU.

**Note**: Traffic dropped from unknown or untrusted IP addresses can prevent hosts with dynamically-assigned IP addresses from establishment of a connection to the Cisco IOS device.

```
!

access-list 152 deny tcp <trusted-addresses> <mask> any eq 22
access-list 152 permit tcp any any eq 22
access-list 152 deny ip any any
!

class-map match-all COPP-KNOWN-UNDESIRABLE
 match access-group 152
!

policy-map COPP-INPUT-POLICY
 class COPP-KNOWN-UNDESIRABLE
  drop
!

control-plane
 service-policy input COPP-INPUT-POLICY
!
```

In the previous CoPP example, the ACL entries that match the unauthorized packets with the permit action result in a discard of these packets by the policy-map drop function, while packets that match the deny action are not affected by the policy-map drop function.

CoPP is available in Cisco IOS Software Release trains 12.0S, 12.2SX, 12.2S, 12.3T, 12.4, and 12.4T.

#### Control Plane Protection

Control Plane Protection (CPPr), introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(4)T, can be used to restrict or police control plane traffic destined to the CPU of the Cisco IOS device. While similar to CoPP, CPPr can restrict traffic with finer granularity. The CPPr divides the aggregate control plane into three separate control plane categories known as subinterfaces. Subinterfaces exist for Host, Transit, and CEF-Exception traffic categories. In addition, CPPr includes these control plane protection features:

* **Port-filtering feature** - This feature provides for packets sent to closed or non-listening TCP or UDP ports to be policed and dropped.
* **Queue-thresholding feature** - This feature limits the number of packets for a specified protocol allowed in the control-plane IP input queue.

Refer to [Understanding Control Plane Protection (CPPr)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/qos_plcshp/configuration/15-mt/qos-plcshp-15-mt-book/qos-plcshp-cpp.html) for more information on use of the CPPr feature.

#### Hardware Rate Limiters

The Cisco Catalyst 6500 Series Supervisor Engine 32 and Supervisor Engine 720 support platform-specific, hardware-based rate limiters (HWRLs) for special network scenarios. These hardware rate limiters are referred to as special-case rate limiters because they cover a specific predefined set of IPv4, IPv6, unicast, and multicast DoS scenarios. The HWRLs can protect the Cisco IOS device from a variety of attacks that require packets to be processed by the CPU.

There are several HWRLs enabled by default. Refer to [PFC3 Hardware-based Rate Limiter Default Settings](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SXF/native/configuration/guide/swcg/dos.html#wp1141328) for more information about HWRLs.

Refer to [Hardware-Based Rate Limiters on the PFC3](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst6500/ios/12-2SXF/native/configuration/guide/swcg/dos.html#wp1141067) for more information about HWRLs.

### Secure BGP

The Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) is the routing foundation of the Internet. As such, any organization with more than modest connectivity requirements often uses BGP. The BGP is often targeted by attackers because of its ubiquity and the *set and forget* nature of BGP configurations in smaller organizations. However, there are many BGP-specific security features that can be leveraged to increase the security of a BGP configuration.

This provides an overview of the most important BGP security features, and where appropriate, configuration recommendations are made.

#### TTL-based Security Protections

Each IP packet contains a 1-byte field known as the Time to Live (TTL). Each device that an IP packet traverses decrements this value by one. The TTL start value varies by the operation system and typically ranges from 64 to 255. A packet is dropped when its TTL value reaches zero.

Known as both the Generalized TTL-based Security Mechanism (GTSM) and BGP TTL Security Hack (BTSH), a TTL-based security protection leverages the TTL value of IP packets to ensure the BGP packets received are from a directly connected peer. This feature often requires coordination from peer routers; however, once enabled, it can completely defeat many TCP-based attacks against BGP.

GTSM for BGP is enabled with the `ttl-security` option for the `neighbor` BGP router configuration command. This example illustrates the configuration of this feature:

```
!

router bgp <asn>
 neighbor <ip-address> remote-as <remote-asn>
 neighbor <ip-address> ttl-security hops <hop-count>
!
```

As BGP packets are received, the TTL value is checked and must be greater than or equal to 255, minus the hop-count specified.

#### BGP Peer Authentication with MD5

Peer authentication with MD5 creates an MD5 digest of each packet sent as part of a BGP session. Specifically, portions of the IP and TCP headers, TCP payload, and a secret key are used to generate the digest.

The created digest is then stored in TCP option Kind 19, which was created specifically for this purpose by [RFC 2385](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc2385) . The recipiant BGP speaker uses the same algorithm and secret key to regenerate the message digest. If the received and computed digests are not identical, the packet is discarded.

Peer authentication with MD5 is configured with the `password` option to the `neighbor` BGP router configuration command. The use of this command is illustrated here:

```
!

router bgp <asn>
 neighbor <ip-address> remote-as <remote-asn>
 neighbor <ip-address> password <secret>
!
```

Refer to [Neighbor Router Authentication](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/iproute_bgp/command/reference/irg_book/irg_bgp3.html#wp1071961) for more information about BGP peer authentication with MD5.

#### Configure Maximum Prefixes

BGP prefixes are stored by a router in memory. The more prefixes a router must hold, the more memory BGP consumes. In some configurations, a subset of all internet prefixes can be stored, such as in configurations that leverage only a default route or routes for provider user networks.

To prevent memory exhaustion, configure the maximum number of prefixes accepted on a per-peer basis. It is recommended that a limit be configured for each BGP peer.

When you configure this feature with the `neighbor maximum-prefix` BGP router configuration command, one argument is required: the maximum number of prefixes  accepted before a peer is shutdown. Optionally, a number from 1 to 100 can also be entered. This number represents the percentage of the maximum prefixes value as to when a log message is sent.

```
!

router bgp <asn>
 neighbor <ip-address> remote-as <remote-asn>
 neighbor <ip-address> maximum-prefix <shutdown-threshold> <log-percent>
!
```

Refer to [Configuring the BGP Maximum-Prefix Feature](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/border-gateway-protocol-bgp/25160-bgp-maximum-prefix.html) for more information about per-peer maximum prefixes.

#### Filter BGP Prefixes with Prefix Lists

Prefix lists allow a network administrator to permit or deny specific prefixes sent or received by BGP. Use prefix lists, where possible, to ensure network traffic is sent over the intended paths. Apply prefix lists to each eBGP peer in both the inbound and outbound directions.

Configured prefix lists limit the prefixes sent or received to those specifically permitted by the route policy of a network. If this is not feasible due to the large number of prefixes received, configure a prefix list to specifically block known bad prefixes. These known bad prefixes include unallocated IP address space and networks reserved for internal or test purposes by [RFC 3330](https://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3330.txt). Configure outbound prefix lists to specifically permit only the prefixes an organization intends to advertise.

This configuration example uses prefix lists to limit the routes that are learned and advertised. Specifically, only a default route is allowed inbound by prefix list BGP-PL-INBOUND, and the prefix 192.168.2.0/24 is the only route allowed to be advertised by BGP-PL-OUTBOUND.

```
!

ip prefix-list BGP-PL-INBOUND seq 5 permit 0.0.0.0/0
ip prefix-list BGP-PL-OUTBOUND seq 5 permit 192.168.2.0/24
!

router bgp <asn>
 neighbor <ip-address> prefix-list BGP-PL-INBOUND in
 neighbor <ip-address> prefix-list BGP-PL-OUTBOUND out
!
```

Refer to [Connecting to a Service Provider Using External BGP](https://search.cisco.com/search?query=Cisco%20IOS%20BGP%20Configuration%20Guide&locale=enUS&tab=Cisco) for complete coverage of BGP prefix filter information.

#### Filter BGP Prefixes with Autonomous System Path Access Lists

BGP autonomous system (AS) path access lists allow the user to filter received and advertised prefixes based on the AS-path attribute of a prefix. This can be used  with prefix lists to establish a robust set of filters.

This configuration example uses AS path access lists to restrict inbound prefixes to those originated by the remote AS and outbound prefixes to those originated by the local autonomous system. Prefixes sourced from all other autonomous systems are filtered and not installed in the routing table.

```
!

ip as-path access-list 1 permit ^65501$
ip as-path access-list 2 permit ^$
!

router bgp <asn>
 neighbor <ip-address> remote-as 65501
 neighbor <ip-address> filter-list 1 in
 neighbor <ip-address> filter-list 2 out
!
```
### Secure Interior Gateway Protocols

The ability of a network to properly forward traffic and recover from topology changes or faults depends on an accurate view of the topology. You can often run an Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP) to provide this view. By default, IGPs are dynamic and discover additional routers that communicate with the particular IGP in use. IGPs also discover routes that can be used when a network link fails.

These subsections provide an overview of the most important IGP security features. Recommendations and examples that cover Routing Information Protocol Version 2 (RIPv2), Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP), and Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) are provided when appropriate.

#### Routing Protocol Authentication and Verification with Message Digest 5

Failure to secure the exchange of routing information allows an attacker to introduce false routing information into the network. Use password authentication with routing protocols between routers to aid network security. However, because this authentication is sent as cleartext, it can be simple for an attacker to subvert this security control.

When MD5 hash capabilities are added to the authentication process, routing updates no longer contain cleartext passwords, and the entire contents of the routing update is more tamper resistant. However, MD5 authentication is still susceptible to brute force and dictionary attacks if weak passwords are used. You are advised to use passwords with sufficient randomization. Since MD5 authentication is much more secure when compared to password authentication, these examples are specific to MD5 authentication. IPSec can also be used to validate and secure routing protocols, but these examples do not detail its use.

Both EIGRP and RIPv2 use Key Chains as part of the configuration. Refer to [key](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/iproute_pi/command/reference/iri_book/iri_pi1.html#wp1013148) for more information on the configuration and use of Key Chains.

This is an example configuration for EIGRP router authentication that uses MD5:

```
!

key chain <key-name>
 key <key-identifier>
 key-string <password>
!

interface <interface>
 ip authentication mode eigrp <as-number> md5
 ip authentication key-chain eigrp <as-number> <key-name>
!

```

This is an example MD5 router authentication configuration for RIPv2. RIPv1 does not support authentication.

```
!

key chain <key-name>
 key <key-identifier>
 key-string <password>
!

interface <interface>
 ip rip authentication mode md5
 ip rip authentication key-chain <key-name>
!
```

This is an example configuration for OSPF router authentication with MD5. OSPF does not use Key Chains.

```
!

interface <interface>
 ip ospf message-digest-key <key-id> md5 <password>
!

router ospf <process-id>
 network 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 area 0
 area 0 authentication message-digest
!
```

Refer to [Configuring OSPF](https://search.cisco.com/search?query=Cisco%20IOS%20OSPF%20Configuration%20Guide&locale=enUS&tab=Cisco) for more information.

#### Passive-Interface Commands

Information leaks, or the introduction of false information into an IGP, can be mitigated through use of the `passive-interface` command that assists with control of the advertisement of routing information. You are advised not to advertise any information to networks outside your administrative control.

This example demonstrates use of this feature:

```
!

router eigrp <as-number>
 passive-interface default
 no passive-interface <interface>
!
```
#### Route Filtering

To reduce the possibility that you introduce false route information on the network, use Route Filtering. Unlike the `passive-interface` router configuration command, routing occurs on interfaces once route filtration is enabled, but the information that is advertised or processed is limited.

For EIGRP and RIP, use of the `distribute-list` command with the `out` keyword limits the information advertised, while use of the `in` keyword limits the updates processed. The `distribute-list` command is available for OSPF, but it does not prevent a router from propagation of filtered routes. Instead, the `area filter-list` command can be used.

This EIGRP example filters outbound advertisements with the `distribute-list` command and a prefix list:

```
!

ip prefix-list <list-name> seq 10 permit <prefix>
!

router eigrp <as-number>
 passive-interface default
 no passive-interface <interface>
 distribute-list prefix <list-name> out <interface>
!
```

This EIGRP example filters inbound updates with a prefix list:

```
!

ip prefix-list <list-name> seq 10 permit <prefix>
!

router eigrp <as-number>
 passive-interface default
 no passive-interface <interface>
 distribute-list prefix <list-name> in <interface>
!
```

This OSPF example uses a prefix list with the OSPF-specific `area filter-list command:`

```
!

ip prefix-list <list-name> seq 10 permit <prefix>
!

router ospf <process-id>
 area <area-id> filter-list prefix <list-name> in
!
```
#### Routing Process Resource Consumption

Routing Protocol prefixes are stored by a router in memory, and resource consumption increases with additional prefixes a router must hold. To prevent resource exhaustion, configure the routing protocol to limit resource consumption. This is possible with OSPF if you use the Link State Database Overload Protection feature.

This example demonstrates configuration of the OSPF Link State Database Overload Protection feature:

```
!

router ospf <process-id>
 max-lsa <maximum-number>
!
```
### Secure First Hop Redundancy Protocols

First Hop Redundancy Protocols (FHRPs) provide resiliency and redundancy for devices that act as default gateways. This situation and these protocols are commonplace in environments where a pair of Layer 3 devices provides default gateway functionality for a network segment or set of VLANs that contain servers or workstations.

The Gateway Load-Balancing Protocol (GLBP), Hot Standby Router Protocol (HSRP), and Virtual Router Redundancy Protocol (VRRP) are all FHRPs. By default, these protocols communicate with unauthenticated communications. This kind of communication can allow an attacker to pose as an FHRP-compliant device to assume the default gateway role on the network. This takeover allows an attacker to perform a man-in-the-middle attack and intercept all user traffic that exits the network.

To prevent this type of attack, all FHRPs supported by Cisco IOS software include an authentication capability with either MD5 or text strings. Because of the threat posed by unauthenticated FHRPs, it is recommended that instances of these protocols use MD5 authentication. This configuration example demonstrates the use of GLBP, HSRP, and VRRP MD5 authentication:

```
!

interface FastEthernet 1
 description *** GLBP Authentication ***
 glbp 1 authentication md5 key-string <glbp-secret>
 glbp 1 ip 10.1.1.1
!

interface FastEthernet 2
 description *** HSRP Authentication ***
 standby 1 authentication md5 key-string <hsrp-secret>
 standby 1 ip 10.2.2.1
!

interface FastEthernet 3
 description *** VRRP Authentication ***
 vrrp 1 authentication md5 key-string <vrrp-secret>
 vrrp 1 ip 10.3.3.1
!
```
##

## Data Plane

Although the data plane is responsible to move data from source to destination, within the context of security, the data plane is the least important of the three planes. For this reason, it is important to protect the management and control planes in preference over the data plane when you secure a network device .

However, within the data plane itself, there are many features and configuration options that can help secure traffic. These sections detail the features and options so you can more easily secure your network.

### General Data Plane Hardening

The vast majority of data plane traffic flows across the network as determined by the network routing configuration. However, IP network functionality exists to alter the path of packets across the network. Features, such as IP Options, specifically the source routing option, form a security challenge on networks today.

Use of Transit ACLs is also relevant to harden the data plane.

For more information, see the [Filter Transit Traffic with Transit ACLs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc100) section.

#### IP Options Selective Drop

There are two security concerns presented by IP options. Traffic that contains IP options must be process-switched by Cisco IOS devices, which can lead to an elevated CPU load. IP options also include the functionality to alter the path traffic takes through the network, which potentially allows it to subvert security controls.

Due to these concerns, the global configuration command `ip options {drop | ignore}` has been added to Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.3(4)T, 12.0(22)S, and 12.2(25)S. In the first form of this command, `ip options drop`, all IP packets that contain IP options received by the Cisco IOS device are dropped. This prevents both the elevated CPU load and possible subversion of security controls that IP options can enable.

The second form of this command, `ip options ignore`, configures the Cisco IOS device to ignore IP options contained in received packets. While this mitigates the threats related to IP options for the local device, it is possible downstream devices could be affected by the presence of IP options. For this reason, the `drop` form of this command is highly recommended. As is demonstrated in this configuration example:

```
!
ip options drop
!
```

Some protocols, for example the RSVP, make legitimate use of IP options. The functionality of these protocols is impacted by this command.

Once IP Options Selective Drop has been enabled, the `show ip traffic EXEC` command can be used to determine the number of packets that are dropped due to the presence of IP options. This information is present in the forced drop counter.

#### Disable IP Source Routing

IP source routing leverages the Loose Source Route and Record Route options, in tandem; or the Strict Source Route, along with the Record Route option to enable the IP datagram source to specify the network path a packet takes. This functionality can be used in attempts to route traffic around security controls on the network.

If IP options have not been completely disabled by the IP Options Selective Drop feature, it is important that IP source routing is disabled. IP source routing, which is enabled by default in all Cisco IOS Software Releases, is disabled by the `no ip source-route` global configuration command. This configuration example illustrates the use of this command:

```
!
no ip source-route
!
```
#### Disable ICMP Redirects

ICMP redirects are used to inform a network device of a better path to an IP destination. By default, the Cisco IOS software sends a redirect if it receives a packet that must be routed through the interface it was received.

In some situations, it can be possible for an attacker to cause the Cisco IOS device to send many ICMP redirect messages, which results in an elevated CPU load. For this reason, it is recommended the transmission of ICMP redirects be disabled. ICMP redirects are disabled with the interface configuration `no ip redirects` command, as shown in this example configuration:

```
!

interface FastEthernet 0
 no ip redirects
!
```
#### Disable or Limit IP Directed Broadcasts

IP Directed Broadcasts make it possible to send an IP broadcast packet to a remote IP subnet. Once the packet reaches the remote network, the forwarding IP device sends the packet as a Layer 2 broadcast to all stations on the subnet. This directed broadcast functionality has been leveraged as an amplification and reflection aid in several attacks, which includes the smurf attack.

By default, current versions of Cisco IOS software have this functionality disabled; however, it can be enabled by the `ip directed-broadcast` interface configuration command. By default, releases of Cisco IOS software prior to 12.0 have this functionality enabled.

If a network absolutely requires directed broadcast functionality, control its use. This is possible with the use of an ACL as an option to the `ip directed-broadcast` command. This configuration example limits directed broadcasts to UDP packets that originate at a trusted network, 192.168.1.0/24:

```
!

access-list 100 permit udp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 any
!

interface FastEthernet 0
 ip directed-broadcast 100
!
```
### Filter Transit Traffic with Transit ACLs

It is possible to control what traffic transits the network with the use of transit ACLs (tACLs). This is in contrast to iACLs that seek to filter traffic destined to the network itself. The filter provided by tACLs is beneficial when the goal is to filter traffic to a particular group of devices or traffic that transits the network.

Traditionally, firewalls perform this filter type. However, there are instances where it can be beneficial to perform this filter on a Cisco IOS device on the network. For example, where filtration must be performed but no firewall is present.

The tACLs are also an appropriate place in which to implement static anti-spoofing protections.

For more information, see the [Anti-Spoofing Protections](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc104) section.

Refer to [Transit Access Control Lists: Filtering at Your Edge](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/44541-tacl.html) for more information about tACLs.

#### ICMP Packet Filtering

The Internet Control Message Protocol (ICMP) was designed as a control protocol for IP. As such, the messages it conveys can have significant ramifications on the TCP and IP protocols in general. The ICMP is used by the tools `ping` and `traceroute`, to troubleshoot the network, as well as by Path MTU Discovery. However, external ICMP connectivity is rarely needed for proper network operation.

Cisco IOS software provides functionality to specifically filter ICMP messages by name or type and code. This example ACL allows ICMP from trusted networks, while it blocks all ICMP packets from other sources:

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-TRANSIT-IN
!
!--- Permit ICMP packets from trusted networks only
!

 permit icmp host <trusted-networks> any
!
!--- Deny all other IP traffic to any network device
!

 deny icmp any any
!
```
#### Filter IP Fragments

As detailed previously in the [Limit Access to the Network with Infrastructure ACLs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc28) section of this document, the filter of fragmented IP packets can pose a challenge to security devices.

Because of the nonintuitive nature of fragment control, IP fragments are often inadvertently permitted by ACLs. Fragmentation is also often used in attempts to evade detection by intrusion detection systems. For these reasons, IP fragments are often used in attacks and can be explicitly filtered at the top of any configured tACLs. The ACL example listed includes a comprehensive filter of IP fragments. The functionality illustrated in this example must be used with the functionality of the previous examples:

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-TRANSIT-IN
!
!--- Deny IP fragments using protocol-specific ACEs to aid in
!--- classification of attack traffic
!

 deny tcp any any fragments
 deny udp any any fragments
 deny icmp any any fragments
 deny ip any any fragments
!
```

Refer to [Access Control Lists and IP Fragments](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/generic-routing-encapsulation-gre/8014-acl-wp.html) for more information about how ACL handles fragmented IP packets.

#### ACL Support to Filter IP Options

In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(4)T and later, Cisco IOS software supports the use of ACLs to filter IP packets, based on the IP options contained in the packet. The presence of IP options within a packet can indicate an attempt to subvert security controls on the network or otherwise alter the transit characteristics of a packet. For these reasons, packets with IP options are recommended to be filtered at the edge of the network.

Use this example, along with the content from previous examples to include a complete filter for IP packets that contain IP options:

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-TRANSIT-IN
!
!--- Deny IP packets containing IP options
!

 deny ip any any option any-options
!
```
### Anti-Spoofing Protections

Many attacks use source IP address spoofing to be effective or to conceal the true source of an attack and hinder accurate traceback. Cisco IOS software provides Unicast RPF and IP Source Guard (IPSG) to deter attacks that rely on source IP address spoofing. In addition, ACLs and null routing are often deployed as a manual means of spoofing prevention.

The IPSG works to minimize spoofing for networks under direct administrative control by the performance of switch port, MAC address, and source address verification. Unicast RPF provides source network verification and can reduce spoofed attacks from networks not under direct administrative control. Port Security can be used to validate MAC addresses at the access layer. Dynamic Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) Inspection (DAI) mitigates attack vectors that use ARP poisoning on local segments.

#### Unicast RPF

Unicast RPF enables a device to verify the source address of a forwarded packet can be reached through the interface that received the packet. Do not rely on Unicast RPF as the only protection against spoofing. Spoofed packets could enter the network through a Unicast RPF-enabled interface if an appropriate return route to the source IP address exists. Unicast RPF relies on you to enable Cisco Express Forwarding on each device and is configured on a per-interface basis.

Unicast RPF can be configured in one of two modes: loose or strict. In cases where there is asymmetric routing, loose mode is preferred because strict mode is known to drop packets in these situations. During configuration of the `ip verify` interface configuration command, the keyword `any` configures loose mode while the keyword **rx** configures strict mode.

This example illustrates configuration of this feature:

```
!

ip cef
!

interface <interface>
  ip verify unicast source reachable-via <mode>
!
```

Refer to [Understanding Unicast Reverse Path Forwarding](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/csp_404.html) for more information about the configuration and use of Unicast RPF.

#### IP Source Guard

IP Source Guard is an effective means of spoofing prevention that can be used if you have control over Layer 2 interfaces. IP Source Guard uses information from DHCP snooping to dynamically configure a port access control list (PACL) on the Layer 2 interface, denyal of any traffic from IP addresses that are not associated in the IP source binding table.

IP Source Guard can be applied to Layer 2 interfaces that belong to DHCP snooping-enabled VLANs. These commands enable DHCP snooping:

```
!

ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan <vlan-range>
!
```

After DHCP snooping is enabled, these commands enable IPSG:

```
!
interface <interface-id>
   ip verify source
!
```

Port security can be enabled with the `Tip verify source port security` interface configuration command. This requires the global configuration command `ip dhcp snooping information option;` additionally, the DHCP server must support DHCP option 82.

Refer to [Configuring DHCP features and IP Source Guard](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_40_se/configuration/guide/scg1/swdhcp82.html) for more information on this feature.

#### Port Security

Port Security is used to mitigate MAC address spoofing at the access interface. Port Security can use dynamically learned (sticky) MAC addresses to ease in the initial configuration. Once port security has determined a MAC violation, it can use one of four violation modes. These modes are: protect, restrict, shutdown, and shutdown VLAN. In instances when a port only provides access for a single workstation with the use of standard protocols, a maximum number of one can be sufficient. Protocols that leverage virtual MAC addresses, such as HSRP do not function when the maximum number is set to one.

```
!

interface <interface>
  switchport
  switchport mode access
  switchport port-security
  switchport port-security mac-address sticky
  switchport port-security maximum <number>
  switchport port-security violation <violation-mode>
!
```

Refer to [Configuring Port Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_40_se/configuration/guide/scg1/swtrafc.html) for more information about the Port Security confuration.

#### Dynamic ARP Inspection

Dynamic ARP Inspection (DAI) can be used to mitigate ARP poisoning attacks on local segments. An ARP poisoning attack is a method in which an attacker sends falsified ARP information to a local segment. This information is designed to corrupt the ARP cache of other devices. Often an attacker uses ARP poisoning to perform a man-in-the-middle attack.

DAI intercepts and validates the IP-to-MAC address relationship of all ARP packets on untrusted ports. In DHCP environments, DAI uses the data that is generated by the DHCP snooping feature. ARP packets are received on trusted interfaces are not validated and invalid packets on untrusted interfaces are discarded. In non-DHCP environments, the use of ARP ACLs is required.

These commands enable DHCP snooping:

```
!
ip dhcp snooping
ip dhcp snooping vlan <vlan-range>
!
```

Once DHCP snooping has been enabled, these commands enable DAI:

```
!
ip arp inspection vlan <vlan-range>
!
```

In non-DHCP environments, ARP ACLs are required to enable DAI. This example demonstrates the basic configuration of DAI with ARP ACLs:

```
!

arp access-list <acl-name>
 permit ip host <sender-ip> mac host <sender-mac>
!

ip arp inspection filter <arp-acl-name> vlan <vlan-range>
!
```

DAI can also be enabled on per interface basis wherever supported.

```
ip arp inspection limit rate <rate_value> burst interval <interval_value>
```

Refer to [Configuring Dynamic ARP Inspection](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_40_se/configuration/guide/scg1/swdynarp.html) for more information on how to configure DAI.

#### Anti-Spoofing ACLs

Manually configured ACLs can provide static anti-spoofing protection against attacks that use known unused and untrusted address space. Commonly, these anti-spoofing ACLs are applied to ingress traffic at network boundaries as a component of a larger ACL. Anti-spoofing ACLs require regular monitor intervals because they can change frequently. Spoofing can be minimized in traffic that originates from the local network if you apply outbound ACLs that limit the traffic to valid local addresses.

This example demonstrates how to use ACLs to limit IP spoofing. This ACL is applied inbound on the desired interface. The ACEs that make up this ACL are not comprehensive. If you configure these ACL types, seek an up-to-date reference that is conclusive.

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-ANTISPOOF-IN
 deny	ip 10.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 any
 deny	ip 192.168.0.0 0.0.255.255 any
!

interface <interface>
 ip access-group ACL-ANTISPOOF-IN in
!
```

Refer to [Configuring Commonly Used IP ACLs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/26448-ACLsamples.html) for more information on how to configure Access Control Lists.

### Limit CPU Impact of Data Plane Traffic

The primary purpose of routers and switches is to forward packets and frames through the device onward to final destinations. These packets, which transit the devices deployed throughout the network, can impact CPU operations of a device. Secure the data plane, which consists of traffic that transits the network device, to ensure the operation of the management and control planes. If transit traffic can cause a device to process switch traffic, the control plane of a device can be affected, which leads to an operational disruption.

#### Features and Traffic Types that Impact the CPU

Although not exhaustive, this list includes data plane traffic types that require a special CPU processing and are process switched by the CPU:

* **ACL Logging** - ACL log traffic consists of any packets generated due to a match (permit or deny) of an ACE on which the **log** keyword is used.
* **Unicast RPF** - Unicast RPF used with an ACL can result in the process switching of certain packets.
* **IP Options** - Any IP packets with options included must be processed by the CPU.
* **Fragmentation** - Any IP packet that requires fragmentation must be passed to the CPU for processing.
* **Time-to-Live (TTL) Expiry** - Packets that have a TTL value less than or equal to 1 require Internet Control Message Protocol Time Exceeded (ICMP Type 11, Code 0) messages to be sent, which results in CPU processing.
* **ICMP Unreachables** - Packets that result in ICMP unreachable messages due to their route, MTU, or filtration are processed by the CPU.
* **Traffic that requires an ARP Request** - Destinations for which an ARP entry does not exist are processed by the CPU.
* **Non-IP Traffic** - All non-IP traffic is processed by the CPU.

For more information about Data Plane Hardening, see the [General Data Plane Hardening](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc95)  section.

#### Filter on TTL Value

You can use the ACL Support for Filtering on TTL Value feature, introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(2)T, in an extended IP access list to filter packets based on the TTL value. This feature can protect a device that receives transit traffic where the TTL value is a zero or one. Filter of packets based on TTL values can also be used to ensure the TTL value is not lower than the diameter of the network, this protects the control plane of downstream infrastructure devices from TTL expiry attacks.

Some applications and tools, such as `traceroute` use TTL expiry packets for test and diagnostic purposes. Some protocols, such as IGMP, legitimately use a TTL value of one.

This ACL example creates a policy that filters IP packets where the TTL value is less than 6.

```
!
!--- Create ACL policy that filters IP packets with a TTL value
!--- less than 6
!

ip access-list extended ACL-TRANSIT-IN
 deny ip any any ttl lt 6
 permit ip any any
!
!--- Apply access-list to interface in the ingress direction
!

interface GigabitEthernet 0/0
 ip access-group ACL-TRANSIT-IN in
!
```

Refer to [TTL Expiry Attack Identification and Mitigation](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/ttl_expiry_attack.html) for more information about how to filter packets based on the TTL value.

Refer to [ACL Support for Filtering on TTL Value](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/obsolete/ios-nx-os-software/cisco-ios-software-release-12-4-2-t.html) for more information about this feature.

In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(4)T and later, Flexible Packet Matching (FPM) allows an administrator to match on arbitrary bits of a packet. This FPM policy drops packets with a TTL value less than 6.

```
!

load protocol flash:ip.phdf
!

class-map type access-control match-all FPM-TTL-LT-6-CLASS
 match field IP ttl lt 6
!

policy-map type access-control FPM-TTL-LT-6-DROP-POLICY
 class  FPM-TTL-LT-6-CLASS
  drop
!

interface FastEthernet0
 service-policy type access-control input FPM-TTL-LT-6-DROP-POLICY
!
```
#### Filter on the Presence of IP Options

In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(4)T and later, you can use the ACL Support for the Filtering IP Options feature in a named, extended IP access list to filter IP packets with IP options present. Filter of IP packets based on the presence of IP options can also be used to prevent the control plane of infrastructure devices from the need to process these packets at the CPU level.

The ACL Support for Filtering IP Options feature can be used only with named, extended ACLs. RSVP, Multiprotocol Label Switching Traffic Engineering, IGMP Versions 2 and 3, and other protocols that use IP options packets cannot function properly if packets for these protocols are dropped. If these protocols are in use on the network, then the ACL Support for Filtering IP Options can be used. However, the ACL IP Options Selective Drop feature can drop this traffic and these protocols cannot function properly. If there are no protocols in use that require IP options, ACL IP Options Selective Drop is the preferred method to drop these packets.

This ACL example creates a policy that filters IP packets that contain any IP options:

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-TRANSIT-IN
 deny ip any any option any-options
 permit ip any any
!

interface GigabitEthernet 0/0
 ip access-group ACL-TRANSIT-IN in
!
```

This example ACL demonstrates a policy that filters IP packets with five specific IP options. Packets that contain these options are denied:

* 0 End of Options List (eool)
* 7 Record Route (record-route)
* 68 Time Stamp (timestamp)
* 131 - Loose Source Route (lsr)
* 137 - Strict Source Route (ssr)

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-TRANSIT-IN
 deny ip any any option eool
 deny ip any any option record-route
 deny ip any any option timestamp
 deny ip any any option lsr
 deny ip any any option ssr
 permit ip any any
!

interface GigabitEthernet 0/0
 ip access-group ACL-TRANSIT-IN in
!
```

Refer to the [General Data Plane Hardening](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc95) section of this document for more information about ACL IP Options Selective Drop.

Refer to [Transit Access Control Lists: Filtering at Your Edge](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/44541-tacl.html) for more information about how to filter transit and edge traffic.

Another feature in Cisco IOS software that can be used to filter packets with IP options is CoPP. In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(4)T and later, CoPP allows an administrator to filter the traffic flow of control plane packets. A device that supports CoPP and ACL Support for Filtering IP Options, introduced in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.3(4)T, can use an access list policy to filter packets that contain IP options.

This CoPP policy drops transit packets that are received by a device when any IP options are present:

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-IP-OPTIONS-ANY
 permit ip any any option any-options
!

class-map ACL-IP-OPTIONS-CLASS
 match access-group name ACL-IP-OPTIONS-ANY
!

policy-map COPP-POLICY
 class ACL-IP-OPTIONS-CLASS
  drop
!

control-plane
 service-policy input COPP-POLICY
!
```

This CoPP policy drops transit packets received by a device when these IP options are present:

* 0 End of Options List (eool)
* 7 Record Route (record-route)
* 68 Time Stamp (timestamp)
* 131 Loose Source Route (lsr)
* 137 Strict Source Route (ssr)

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-IP-OPTIONS
 permit ip any any option eool
 permit ip any any option record-route
 permit ip any any option timestamp
 permit ip any any option lsr
 permit ip any any option ssr
!

class-map ACL-IP-OPTIONS-CLASS
 match access-group name ACL-IP-OPTIONS
!

policy-map COPP-POLICY
 class ACL-IP-OPTIONS-CLASS
  drop
!

control-plane
 service-policy input COPP-POLICY
!
```

In the prior CoPP policies, the access control list entries (ACEs) that match packets with the permit action result in the discard of these packets by the policy-map drop function, while packets that match the deny action (not shown) are not affected by the policy-map drop function.

#### Control Plane Protection

In Cisco IOS Software Release 12.4(4)T and later, Control Plane Protection (CPPr) can be used to restrict or police control plane traffic by the CPU of a Cisco IOS device. While similar to CoPP, CPPr can restrict or police traffic with finer granularity than CoPP. CPPr divides the aggregate control plane into three separate control plane categories known as subinterfaces: Host, Transit, and CEF-Exception subinterfaces exist.

This CPPr policy drops transit packets received by a device where the TTL value is less than 6 and transit or non-transit packets received by a device where the TTL value is zero or one. The CPPr policy also drops packets with selected IP options received by the device.

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-IP-TTL-0/1
 permit ip any any ttl eq 0 1
!

class-map ACL-IP-TTL-0/1-CLASS
 match access-group name ACL-IP-TTL-0/1
!

ip access-list extended ACL-IP-TTL-LOW
 permit ip any any ttl lt 6
!

class-map ACL-IP-TTL-LOW-CLASS
 match access-group name ACL-IP-TTL-LOW
!

ip access-list extended ACL-IP-OPTIONS
 permit ip any any option eool
 permit ip any any option record-route
 permit ip any any option timestamp
 permit ip any any option lsr
 permit ip any any option ssr
!

class-map ACL-IP-OPTIONS-CLASS
 match access-group name ACL-IP-OPTIONS
!

policy-map CPPR-CEF-EXCEPTION-POLICY
 class ACL-IP-TTL-0/1-CLASS
  drop
 class ACL-IP-OPTIONS-CLASS
  drop
!

!-- Apply CPPr CEF-Exception policy CPPR-CEF-EXCEPTION-POLICY to
!-- the CEF-Exception CPPr sub-interface of the device

!

control-plane cef-exception
 service-policy input CPPR-CEF-EXCEPTION-POLICY
!

policy-map CPPR-TRANSIT-POLICY
 class ACL-IP-TTL-LOW-CLASS
  drop
!

control-plane transit
 service-policy input CPPR-TRANSIT-POLICY
!
```

In the previous CPPr policy, the access control list entries that match packets with the permit action result was that those packets were discarded by the policy-map drop function, while packets that matched the deny action (not shown) were not affected by the policy-map drop function.

Refer to [Understanding Control Plane Protection](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/qos_plcshp/configuration/15-mt/qos-plcshp-15-mt-book/qos-plcshp-cpp.html) and [Control Plane Protection](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/obsolete/ios-nx-os-software/cisco-ios-software-release-12-4-4-t.html) for more information about the CPPr feature.

### Traffic Identification and Traceback

At times, you can need to quickly identify and traceback network traffic, especially during incident response or poor network performance. NetFlow and Classification ACLs are two primary methods to accomplish this with Cisco IOS software. NetFlow can provide visibility into all traffic on the network. Additionally, NetFlow can be implemented with collectors that can provide long-term trending and automated analysis. Classification ACLs are a component of ACLs and require pre-planning to identify specific traffic and manual intervention during analysis. These sections provide a brief overview of each feature.

#### NetFlow

NetFlow identifies anomalous and security-related network activity by track of network flows. NetFlow data can be viewed and analyzed by the CLI, or the data can be exported to a commercial or freeware NetFlow collector for aggregation and analysis. NetFlow collectors, through long-term trends, can provide network behavior and use analysis. NetFlow performs analysis on specific attributes within IP packets and creates flows. Version 5 is the most commonly used version of NetFlow; however, version 9 is more extensible. NetFlow flows can be created with sampled traffic data in high-volume environments.

CEF, or distributed CEF, is a prerequisite to enable NetFlow. NetFlow can be configured on routers and switches.

This example illustrates the basic configuration of NetFlow. In previous releases of Cisco IOS software, the command to enable NetFlow on an interface is `ip route-cache flow` instead of `ip flow {ingress | egress}.`

```
!

ip flow-export destination <ip-address> <udp-port>
ip flow-export version <version>
!

interface <interface>
 ip flow <ingess|egress>
!
```

This is an example of NetFlow output from the CLI. The SrcIf attribute can aid in traceback.

#### Classification ACLs

Classification ACLs provide visibility into traffic that traverses an interface. Classification ACLs do not alter the security policy of a network and are typically constructed to classify individual protocols, source addresses, or destinations. For example, an ACE that permits all traffic could be separated into specific protocols or ports. This more granular classification of traffic into specific ACEs can help provide visibility of the network traffic because each traffic category has its own hit counter. An administrator can also separate the implicit deny at the end of an ACL into granular ACEs to help identify the denied traffic types.

An administrator can expedite an incident response through the  use of classification ACLs with the `show access-list` and `clear ip access-list counters` EXEC commands.

This example shows the configuration of a classification ACL to identify SMB traffic prior to a default deny:

```
!

ip access-list extended ACL-SMB-CLASSIFY
 remark Existing contents of ACL
 remark Classification of SMB specific TCP traffic
 deny	tcp any any eq 139
 deny	tcp any any eq 445
 deny	ip any any
!
```

To identify the traffic that uses a classification ACL, use the `show access-list EXEC` command. The ACL counters can be cleared with the `clear ip access-list counters EXEC` command.

```
router#show access-list ACL-SMB-CLASSIFY
Extended IP access list ACL-SMB-CLASSIFY
    10 deny tcp any any eq 139 (10 matches)
    20 deny tcp any any eq 445 (9 matches)
    30 deny ip any any (184 matches)
```

Refer to [Understanding Access Control List Logging](https://tools.cisco.com/security/center/resources/access_control_list_logging.html) for more information about how to enable  the log capabilities within ACLs.

### Access Control with VLAN Maps and Port Access Control Lists

VLAN Access Control Lists (VACLs), or VLAN maps and Port ACLs (PACLs), provide the capability to enforce access control on non-routed traffic that is closer to endpoint devices than access control lists that are applied to routed interfaces.

These sections provide an overview of the features, benefits, and potential use scenarios of VACLs and PACLs.

#### Access Control with VLAN Maps

VACLs, or VLAN maps that apply to all packets, which enter the VLAN, provide the capability to enforce access control on intra-VLAN traffic. This is not possible with ACLs on routed interfaces. For example, a VLAN map can be used to prevent hosts contained on the same VLAN from communication with each other, which reduces opportunities for local attackers or worms to exploit a host on the same network segment. To deny packets from use of a VLAN map, create an access control list (ACL) that matches the traffic and, in the VLAN map, set the action to drop. Once a VLAN map is configured, all packets that enter the LAN are sequentially evaluated against the configured VLAN map. VLAN access maps support IPv4 and MAC access lists; however, they do not support logs or IPv6 ACLs.

This example uses an extended named access list that illustrates the configuration of this feature:

```
!

ip access-list extended <acl-name>
 permit <protocol> <source-address> <source-port> <destination-address>
     <destination-port>
!

vlan access-map <name> <number>
 match ip address <acl-name>
 action <drop|forward>
!
```

This example demonstrates the use of a VLAN map to deny TCP ports 139 and 445, as well as the vines-ip protocol:

```
!

ip access-list extended VACL-MATCH-ANY
 permit ip any any
!

ip access-list extended VACL-MATCH-PORTS
 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 eq 445
 permit tcp 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 192.168.1.0 0.0.0.255 eq 139
!

mac access-list extended VACL-MATCH-VINES
 permit any any vines-ip
!

vlan access-map VACL 10
 match ip address VACL-MATCH-VINES
 action drop
!

vlan access-map VACL 20
 match ip address VACL-MATCH-PORTS
 action drop
!

vlan access-map VACL 30
 match ip address VACL-MATCH-ANY
 action forward
!

vlan filter VACL vlan 100
!
```

Refer to [Configuring Network Security with ACLs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_40_se/configuration/guide/scg1/swacl.html) for more information about the configuration of VLAN maps.

#### Access Control with PACLs

PACLs can only be applied to the inbound direction on Layer 2 physical interfaces of a switch. Similar to VLAN maps, PACLs provide access control on non-routed or Layer 2 traffic. The syntax for PACLs creation, which takes precedence over VLAN maps and router ACLs, is the same as router ACLs. If an ACL is applied to a Layer 2 interface, then it is referred to as a PACL. Configuration involves the creation of an IPv4, IPv6, or MAC ACL and application of it to the Layer 2 interface.

This example uses an extended named access list to illustrate the configuration of this feature:

```
!

ip access-list extended <acl-name>
 permit <protocol> <source-address> <source-port> <destination-address>
     <destination-port>
!

interface <type> <slot/port>
 switchport mode access
 switchport access vlan <vlan_number>
 ip access-group <acl-name> in
!
```

Refer to the Port ACL section of [Configuring Network Security with ACLs](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst3750/software/release/12-2_40_se/configuration/guide/scg1/swacl.html) for more information about the configuration of PACLs.

#### Access Control with MAC

MAC access control lists or extended lists can be applied on an IP network with the use of this command in interface configuration mode:

```
Cat6K-IOS(config-if)#mac packet-classify

```

**Note**: MAC access control lists is to classify Layer 3 packets as Layer 2 packets. The command is supported in Cisco IOS Software Release 12.2(18)SXD (for Sup 720) and Cisco IOS Software Releases 12.2(33)SRA or later.

This interface command has to be applied on the ingress interface and instructs the forwarding engine to not inspect the IP header. The result is that you can use a MAC access list on the IP environment.

### Private VLAN Use

Private VLANs (PVLANs) are a Layer 2 security feature that limits connectivity between workstations or servers on a VLAN. Without PVLANs, all devices on a Layer 2 VLAN can communicate freely. Network situations exist where security can be aided by the limitation of communication between devices on a single VLAN. For example, PVLANs are often used to prohibit communication between servers on a publicly accessible subnet. If a single server becomes compromised, the lack of connectivity to other servers due to the application of PVLANs can help limit the compromise to the one server.

There are three types of Private VLANs: isolated VLANs, community VLANs, and primary VLANs. The configuration of PVLANs makes use of primary and secondary VLANs. The primary VLAN contains all promiscuous ports, which are described later, and includes one or more secondary VLANs, which can be either isolated or community VLANs.

#### Isolated VLANs

The configuration of a secondary VLAN as an isolated VLAN completely prevents communication between devices on the secondary VLAN. There can only be one isolated VLAN per primary VLAN, and only promiscuous ports can communicate with ports on an isolated VLAN. Isolated VLANs can be used on untrusted networks like networks that support guests.

This configuration example configures VLAN 11 as an isolated VLAN and associates it to the primary VLAN, VLAN 20. This example also configures interface FastEthernet 1/1 as an isolated port on VLAN 11:

```
!

vlan 11
 private-vlan isolated
!

vlan 20
 private-vlan primary
 private-vlan association 11
!

interface FastEthernet 1/1
 description *** Port in Isolated VLAN ***
 switchport mode private-vlan host
 switchport private-vlan host-association 20 11
!
```
#### Community VLANs

A secondary VLAN configured as a community VLAN allows communication among members of the VLAN and with any promiscuous ports on the primary VLAN. However, no communication is possible between any two community VLANs or from a community VLAN to an isolated VLAN. Community VLANs must be used to group servers that need connectivity with one another, but where connectivity to all other devices on the VLAN is not required. This scenario is common on a publicly accessible network or anywhere that servers provide content to untrusted clients.

This example configures a single community VLAN and configures switch port FastEthernet 1/2 as a member of that VLAN. The community VLAN, VLAN 12, is a secondary VLAN to primary VLAN 20.

```
!

vlan 12
 private-vlan community
!

vlan 20
 private-vlan primary
 private-vlan association 12
!

interface FastEthernet 1/2
 description *** Port in Community VLAN ***
 switchport mode private-vlan host
 switchport private-vlan host-association 20 12
!
```
#### Promiscuous Ports

Switch ports placed into the primary VLAN are known as promiscuous ports. Promiscuous ports can communicate with all other ports on the primary and secondary VLANs. Router or firewall interfaces are the most common devices found on these VLANs.

This configuration example combines the previous isolated and community VLAN examples and adds the configuration of interface FastEthernet 1/12 as a promiscuous port:

```
!

vlan 11
 private-vlan isolated
!

vlan 12
 private-vlan community
!

vlan 20
 private-vlan primary
 private-vlan association 11-12
!

interface FastEthernet 1/1
 description *** Port in Isolated VLAN ***
 switchport mode private-vlan host
 switchport private-vlan host-association 20 11
!

interface FastEthernet 1/2
 description *** Port in Community VLAN ***
 switchport mode private-vlan host
 switchport private-vlan host-association 20 12
!

interface FastEthernet 1/12
 description *** Promiscuous Port ***
 switchport mode private-vlan promiscuous
 switchport private-vlan mapping 20 add 11-12
!
```

When you implement PVLANs, it is important to ensure the Layer 3 configuration in place supports the restrictions imposed by PVLANs and does not allow for the PVLAN configuration to be subverted. A Layer 3 filter with a Router ACL or firewall can prevent the subversion of the PVLAN configuration.

Refer to [Private VLANs (PVLANs) - Promiscuous, Isolated, Community](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/tech/lan-switching/lan-security/index.html), located on the [LAN Security](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/tech/lan-switching/lan-security/index.html) homepage, for more information about the use and configuration of Private VLANs.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.
