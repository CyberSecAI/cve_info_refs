        "text": "A vulnerability in the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) function of Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass NETCONF or RESTCONF authentication and do either of the following:\r\n\r\nInstall, manipulate, or delete the configuration of an affected device\r\nCause memory corruption that results in a denial of service (DoS) on an affected device\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to an uninitialized variable. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a series of NETCONF or RESTCONF requests to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to use NETCONF or RESTCONF to install, manipulate, or delete the configuration of a network device or to corrupt memory on the device, resulting a DoS.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the September 2021 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: September 2021 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication.

For either to be affected, all of the following must be configured:\r\n\r\nAAA\r\nNETCONF, RESTCONF, or both\r\nenable password without enable secret\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"#fs\"] section of this advisory.\r\n\r\nNote: The standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN release images are separate from the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases. The SD-WAN feature set was first integrated into the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases starting with IOS XE Software Release 17.2.1r. For additional information, see the Install and Upgrade Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r and Later [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/install-upgrade-17-2-later.html\"] chapter of the Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide.\r\n Determine the Device Configuration\r\nTo determine whether a device has a vulnerable configuration, do the following:\r\n\r\nCheck AAA Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine whether AAA authentication is configured on the device, use the show running-config | include aaa authentication login command, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show running-config | include aaa authentication login\r\naaa authentication login default local group example\r\nRouter#\r\n\r\nCheck NETCONF and RESTCONF Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine whether NETCONF or RESTCONF is configured on the device, use the show running-config | include netconf|restconf command, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show running-config | include netconf|restconf\r\nnetconf-yang\r\nrestconf\r\nRouter#\r\n\r\nCheck enable password Configuration\r\n\r\nTo determine whether enable password is configured on the device without the presence of an enable secret, use the show running-config | include enable password|secret command, as shown in the following example:\r\n\r\n\r\nRouter#show running-config | include enable password|secret\r\nenable password 7 00010B07094B0703\r\nRouter#\r\n\r\nNote: If enable secret is being used without the presence of enable password, the device is not affected."

For more information, see Cisco Guide to Harden Cisco IOS Devices [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/docs/ip/access-lists/13608-21.html#anc14\"].\r\n\r\nThere is also a mitigation that addresses this vulnerability: To limit the attack surface of this vulnerability, ensure that access control lists (ACLs) are in place for NETCONF and RESTCONF to prevent attempted access from untrusted subnets. For more information, see NETCONF and RESTCONF Service-Level ACLs [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios-xml/ios/prog/configuration/1611/b_1611_programmability_cg/service_level_ACLs_NETCONF_RESTCONF.html\"].\r\n\r\nWhile this workaround and this mitigation have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment."

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release—for example, 15.1(4)M2 or 3.13.8S:\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search."
