  "response": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to improper resource release in the Cisco NX-OS Software network stack (netstack) when processing certain IPv6 packets destined to an affected device.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper resource release",
      "Insufficient buffer management in the network stack when processing crafted IPv6 packets."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could cause the network stack to run out of available buffers, impairing the operations of control plane and management plane protocols, resulting in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. Manual intervention (device reload) would be required to restore normal operation.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending multiple crafted IPv6 packets to an affected device."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Unauthenticated, remote attacker.",
      "Ability to craft and send IPv6 packets."
    ],
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects Cisco devices running a vulnerable version of Cisco NX-OS Software with IPv6 configured on at least one interface. The vulnerability can only be exploited if the IPv6 traffic is destined to the affected device. Traffic transiting the device will not trigger this vulnerability. The advisory also provides indicators of compromise, including specific error messages. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability."
