{
  "CVE-2021-1572": {
    "Root cause": "The affected software incorrectly runs the SFTP user service at the privilege level of the account that was running when the NSO/ConfD built-in Secure Shell (SSH) server for CLI was enabled.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect Privilege Assignment"
    ],
    "Impact": "An authenticated, local attacker can execute arbitrary commands at the level of the account under which Cisco NSO/ConfD is running, which is *root* by default.",
    "Attack vectors": "An attacker with low-level privileges authenticates to the affected device and issues a series of commands at the SFTP interface.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker must have a valid local account on the affected device and the NSO/ConfD built-in SSH server must be enabled."
