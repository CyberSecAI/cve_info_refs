## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 5.3 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 5.3 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 5.3 |

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. [Learn more](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/social-justice/inclusive-language-policy.html) about how Cisco is using Inclusive Language.

includes information about AAA on
Cisco NX-OS
devices.

* [AAA Security Services](#con_1234948)

### AAA Security Services

The AAA feature
allows you to verify the identity of, grant access to, and track the actions of
users managing a Cisco NX-OS device. Cisco NX-OS devices support Remote Access
Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) or Terminal Access Controller Access Control
System Plus (TACACS+) protocols.

Based on the user ID
and password combination that you provide, Cisco NX-OS devices perform local
authentication or authorization using the local database or remote
authentication or authorization using one or more AAA servers. A preshared
secret key provides security for communication between the Cisco NX-OS device
and AAA servers. You can configure a common secret key for all AAA servers or
for only a specific AAA server.

AAA security
provides the following services:

Authentication

 Identifies
users, including login and password dialog, challenge and response, messaging
support, and, depending on the security protocol that you select, encryption.

Authentication
is the process of verifying the identity of the person or device accessing the
Cisco NX-OS device, which is based on the user ID and password combination
provided by the entity trying to access the Cisco NX-OS device. Cisco NX-OS
devices allow you to perform local authentication (using the local lookup
database) or remote authentication (using one or more RADIUS or TACACS+
servers).

Authorization

Provides access
control.AAA authorization is the process of assembling a set of attributes that
describe what the user is authorized to perform. Authorization in the Cisco
NX-OS software is provided by attributes that are downloaded from AAA servers.
Remote security servers, such as RADIUS and TACACS+, authorize users for
specific rights by associating attribute-value (AV) pairs, which define those
rights with the appropriate user.

Accounting

Provides the
method for collecting information, logging the information locally, and sending
the information to the AAA server for billing, auditing, and reporting.

The accounting
feature tracks and maintains a log of every management session used to access
the Cisco NX-OS device. You can use this information to generate reports for
troubleshooting and auditing purposes. You can store accounting logs locally or
send them to remote AAA servers.

| **Note** | ---   The Cisco NX-OS software supports authentication, authorization, and accounting independently. For example, you can configure authentication and authorization without configuring accounting.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Benefits of Using AAA

AAA provides the
following benefits:

* Increased
  flexibility and control of access configuration
* Scalability
* Standardized
  authentication methods, such as RADIUS and TACACS+
* Multiple backup
  devices

### Remote AAA Services

Remote AAA services
provided through RADIUS and TACACS+ protocols have the following advantages
over local AAA services:

* It is easier to
  manage user password lists for each
  Cisco NX-OS
  device in the fabric.
* AAA servers are
  already deployed widely across enterprises and can be easily used for AAA
  services.
* You can
  centrally manage the accounting log for all
  Cisco NX-OS
  devices in the fabric.
* It is easier to
  manage user attributes for each
  Cisco NX-OS
  device in the fabric than using the local databases on the
  Cisco NX-OS
  devices.

### AAA Server Groups

You can specify remote AAA servers for authentication, authorization, and accounting using server groups. A server group is
a set of remote AAA servers that implements the same AAA protocol. The purpose of a server group is to provide for failover
servers in case a remote AAA server fails to respond. If the first remote server in the group fails to respond, the next remote
server in the group is tried until one of the servers sends a response. If all the AAA servers in the server group fail to
respond, then that server group option is considered a failure. If required, you can specify multiple server groups. If the
Cisco NX-OS device encounters errors from the servers in the first group, it tries the servers in the next server group.

### AAA Service Configuration Options

The AAA
configuration in
Cisco NX-OS
devices is service based, which means that you can have separate AAA
configurations for the following services:

* User Telnet or
  Secure Shell (SSH) login authentication
* Console login
  authentication
* User management
  session accounting

This table
provides the related CLI command for each AAA service configuration option.

Table 1.  AAA Service
Configuration Commands

| AAA Service Configuration Option | Related Command |
| --- | --- |
| Telnet or SSH login | aaa authentication login default |
| Console login | aaa authentication login console |
| User session accounting | aaa accounting default |

You can specify
the following authentication methods for the AAA services:

All RADIUS
servers

Uses the
global pool of RADIUS servers for authentication.

Specified
server groups

Uses specified
RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP server groups you have configured for authentication.

Local

Uses the local
username or password database for authentication.

None

Specifies that
no AAA authentication be used.

| **Note** | ---   If you specify the all RADIUS servers method, rather than a specified server group method, the Cisco NX-OS device chooses the RADIUS server from the global pool of configured RADIUS servers, in the order of configuration. Servers from this global pool are the servers that can be selectively configured in a RADIUS server group on the Cisco NX-OS device.   --- |
| --- | --- |

This table shows
the AAA authentication methods that you can configure for the AAA services.

Table 2.
AAA
Authentication Methods for AAA Services

| AAA Service | AAA Methods |
| --- | --- |
| Console login authentication | Server groups, local, and none |
| User login authentication | Server groups, local, and none |
| User management session accounting | Server groups and local |

| **Note** | ---   For console login authentication, user login authentication, and user management session accounting, the Cisco NX-OS device tries each option in the order specified. The local option is the default method when other configured options fail. You can disable the local option for the console or default login by using the no aaa authentication login {console | default} fallback error local command.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Authentication and Authorization Process for User Login

Figure 1.  Authorization
and Authentication Flow for User Login. This figure
shows a flow chart of the authentication and authorization process for user
login.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/190001-200000/197001-198000/197006.eps/_jcr_content/renditions/197006.jpg)

The following list
explains the process:

* When you log in
  to the required
  Cisco NX-OS
  device, you can use the Telnet, SSH, or console login options.
* When you have
  configured the AAA server groups using the server group authentication method,
  the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device sends an authentication request to the first AAA server in the group as
  follows:

  + If the AAA
    server fails to respond, the next AAA server is tried and so on until the
    remote server responds to the authentication request.
  + If all AAA
    servers in the server group fail to respond, the servers in the next server
    group are tried.
  + If all
    configured methods fail, the local database is used for authentication, unless
    fallback to local is disabled for the console login.
* If the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device successfully authenticates you through a remote AAA server, then the
  following possibilities apply:

  + If the AAA
    server protocol is RADIUS, then user roles specified in the cisco-av-pair
    attribute are downloaded with an authentication response.
  + If the AAA
    server protocol is TACACS+, then another request is sent to the same server to
    get the user roles specified as custom attributes for the shell.
* If your username
  and password are successfully authenticated locally, the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device logs you in and assigns you the roles configured in the local database.

| **Note** | ---   "No more server groups left" means that there is no response from any server in all server groups. "No more servers left" means that there is no response from any server within this server group.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### AES Password Encryption and Primary Encryption Keys

You can enable strong, reversible 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) password encryption, also known as type-6 encryption.
To start using type-6 encryption, you must enable the AES password encryption feature and configure a primary encryption key,
which is used to encrypt and decrypt passwords.

After you enable AES password encryption and configure a primary key, all existing and newly created clear-text passwords
for supported applications (currently RADIUS and TACACS+) are stored in type-6 encrypted format, unless you disable type-6
password encryption. You can also configure Cisco NX-OS to convert all existing weakly encrypted passwords to type-6 encrypted passwords.

## Prerequisites for AAA

Remote AAA servers
have the following prerequisites:

* Ensure that at
  least one RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP server is reachable through IP.
* Ensure that the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device is configured as a client of the AAA servers.
* Ensure that the
  secret key is configured on the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device and the remote AAA servers.
* Ensure that the
  remote server responds to AAA requests from the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device.

## Guidelines and Limitations for AAA

AAA has the following guidelines and limitations:

* If you have a user account that is configured on the local Cisco NX-OS device that has the same name as a remote user account on an AAA server, the Cisco NX-OS software applies the user roles for the local user account to the remote user, not the user roles configured on the AAA server.
* Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches support the aaa authentication login ascii-authentication  command only for TACACS+ (and not for RADIUS).
* If you modify the default login authentication method (without using the local  keyword), the configuration overrides the console login authentication method. To explicitly configure the console authentication
  method, use the aaa authentication login console {group
  group-list [none] | local | none}  command.
* The login block-for  and login quiet-mode  configuration mode commands are renamed to system login block-for  and system login quiet-mode , respectively.
* When you use the system login quiet-mode access-class QUIET\_LIST  command, you must ensure that the access list is correctly defined to only block the specified traffic. For example, if you
  need to block only the user logins from untrusted hosts, then the access list should specify ports 22, 23, 80, and 443 corresponding
  to SSH, telnet, and HTTP-based access from those hosts.

## Default Settings for AAA

This table lists
the default settings for AAA parameters.

Table 3.  Default AAA
Parameter Settings

| Parameters | Default |
| --- | --- |
| Console authentication method | local |
| Default authentication method | local |
| Login authentication failure messages | Disabled |
| CHAP authentication | Disabled |
| MSCHAP authentication | Disabled |
| Default accounting method | local |
| Accounting log display length | 250 KB |

## Configuring AAA

This section
describes the tasks for configuring AAA on
Cisco NX-OS
devices.

| **Note** | ---   If you are familiar with the Cisco IOS CLI, be aware that the Cisco NX-OS commands for this feature might differ from the Cisco IOS commands that you would use.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Cisco Nexus 9K Series switches support the CLI command, aaa authentication login ascii-authentication, only for TACAAS+, but not for RADIUS. Ensure that you have disabled aaa authentication login ascii-authentication switch so that the default authentication, PAP, is enabled. Otherwise, you will see syslog errors.   --- |

### Process for Configuring AAA

Follow these steps
to configure AAA authentication and accounting:

1. If you want to
   use remote RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP servers for authentication, configure the
   hosts on your Cisco NX-OS device.
2. Configure
   console login authentication methods.
3. Configure
   default login authentication methods for user logins.
4. Configure
   default AAA accounting default methods.

### Configuring Console Login Authentication Methods

This section
describes how to configure the authentication methods for the console login.

The authentication
methods include the following:

* Global pool of
  RADIUS servers
* Named subset of
  RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP servers
* Local database
  on the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device
* Username only
  (none)

The default method
is local, but you have
the option to disable it .

| **Note** | ---   The group radius and group server-name forms of the aaa authentication command refer to a set of previously defined RADIUS servers. Use the radius-server host  command to configure the host servers. Use the aaa group server radius  command to create a named group of servers.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  If you perform a password recovery when remote authentication is enabled, local authentication becomes enabled for console login as soon as the password recovery is done. As a result, you can log into the Cisco NX-OS device through the console port using the new password. After login, you can continue to use local authentication, or you can enable remote authentication after resetting the admin password configured at the AAA servers. For more information about the password recovery process, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Troubleshooting Guide.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Configure RADIUS,
TACACS+, or LDAP server groups, as needed.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authentication login console {group group-list [none] | local | none}  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication login console group radius ``` | Configures login authentication methods for the console.  The group-list argument consists of a space-delimited list of group names. The group names are the following:  radius   Uses the global pool of RADIUS servers for authentication.  named-group  Uses a named subset of RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP servers for authentication.   The local  method uses the local database for authentication, and the none  method specifies that no AAA authentication be used.  The default console login method is local , which is used when no methods are configured or when all the configured methods fail to respond, unless fallback to local is disabled for the console login . |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa authentication  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication ``` | (Optional)  Displays the configuration of the console login authentication methods. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring Default Login Authentication Methods

The authentication
methods include the following:

* Global pool of
  RADIUS servers
* Named subset of
  RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP servers
* Local database
  on the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device
* Username only

The default method
is local, but you have
the option to disable it .

#### Before you begin

Configure RADIUS,
TACACS+, or LDAP server groups, as needed.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authentication login default {group group-list [none] | local | none}  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication login default group radius ``` | Configures the default authentication methods.  The group-list argument consists of a space-delimited list of group names. The group names are the following:   * radius —Uses the global pool of RADIUS servers for   authentication. * named-group—Uses a   named subset of RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP servers for authentication.   The local  method uses the local database for authentication, and the none  method specifies that no AAA authentication be used. The default login method is local , which is used when no methods are configured or when all the configured methods fail to respond, unless fallback to local is disabled for the console login .  You can configure one of the following:   * AAA authentication groups * AAA authentication groups with no authentication * Local authentication * No authentication  | **Note** | The local  keyword is not supported (and is not required) when configuring AAA authentication groups because local authentication is the default if remote servers are unreachable. For example, if you configure aaa authentication login default group g1 , local authentication is tried if you are unable to authenticate using AAA group g1. In contrast, if you configure aaa authentication login default group g1 none , no authentication is performed if you are unable to authenticate using AAA group g1. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa authentication  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication ``` | (Optional)  Displays the configuration of the default login authentication methods. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Disabling Fallback to Local Authentication

By default, if remote authentication is configured for console or default login and
all AAA servers are unreachable (resulting in an authentication error), the Cisco NX-OS device falls back to local authentication to ensure that users aren’t locked out
of the device. However, you can disable fallback to local authentication in order to
increase security.

| **Caution** | ---   Disabling fallback to local authentication can lock your Cisco NX-OS device, forcing you to perform a password recovery in order to gain access. To prevent being locked out of the device, we recommend that you disable fallback to local authentication for only the default login or the console login, not both.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Configure remote authentication for the console or default login.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | no aaa authentication login {console | default} fallback error local  Example: ``` switch(config)# no aaa authentication login console fallback error local ``` | Disables fallback to local authentication for the console or default login if remote authentication is configured and all AAA servers are unreachable.  The following message appears when you disable fallback to local authentication:  ``` “WARNING!!! Disabling fallback can lock your switch.” ``` |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | (Optional)  Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa authentication  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication ``` | (Optional)  Displays the configuration of the console and default login authentication methods. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Enabling the Default User Role for AAA Authentication

You can allow remote
users who do not have a user role to log in to the
Cisco NX-OS
device through a RADIUS or TACACS+ remote authentication server using a default
user role. When you disable the AAA default user role feature, remote users who
do not have a user role cannot log in to the device.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa user default-role  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa user default-role ``` | Enables the default user role for AAA authentication. The default is enabled.  You can disable the default user role feature by using the no  form of this command. |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa user default-role  Example: ``` switch# show aaa user default-role ``` | (Optional)  Displays the AAA default user role configuration. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Enabling Login Authentication Failure Messages

When you log in, the
login is processed by rolling over to the local user database if the remote AAA
servers do not respond. In such cases, the following messages display on the
user’s terminal if you have enabled login failure messages:

```
Remote AAA servers unreachable; local authentication done.
```
```
Remote AAA servers unreachable; local authentication failed.
```

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authentication login error-enable  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication login error-enable ``` | Enables login authentication failure messages. The default is disabled. |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa authentication  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication ``` | (Optional)  Displays the login failure message configuration. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Logging Successful and Failed Login Attempts

You can configure the switch to log all
successful and failed login attempts to the configured syslog server.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | [no] login on-failure log  Example: ``` switch(config)# login on-failure log ``` | Logs all failed authentication messages to the configured syslog server only if the logging level is set to 6. With this configuration, the following syslog message appears after the failed login:  AUTHPRIV-3-SYSTEM\_MSG: pam\_aaa:Authentication failed for user admin from 172.22.00.00   | **Note** | When logging level authpriv is 6, additional Linux kernel authentication messages appear along with the previous message. If these additional messages need to be ignored, the authpriv value should be set to 3. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | [no] login on-success log  Example: ``` switch(config)# login on-success log switch(config)# logging level authpriv 6 switch(config)# logging level daemon 6  ``` | Logs all successful authentication messages to the configured syslog server only if the logging level is set to 6. With this configuration, the following syslog message appears after the successful login:  AUTHPRIV-6-SYSTEM\_MSG: pam\_aaa:Authentication success for user admin from 172.22.00.00   | **Note** | When logging level authpriv is 6, additional Linux kernel authentication messages appear along with the previous message. If these additional messages need to be ignored, the authpriv value should be set to 3. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show login on-failure log  Example: ``` switch(config)# show login on-failure log  ``` | (Optional)  Displays whether the switch is configured to log failed authentication messages to the syslog server. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show login on-successful log  Example: ``` switch(config)# show login on-successful log  ``` | (Optional)  Displays whether the switch is configured to log successful authentication messages to the syslog server. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring Login Block Per User

Ensure that the switch is in global configuration mode.

The Login Block Per User feature helps detect suspected Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and to slow down dictionary attacks.
This feature is applicable for local users and remote users. Use this task to configure login parameters to block a user after
failed login attempts.

| **Note** | ---   From Release 9.3(7), you can configure login block for remote users.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authentication rejected attemptsinsecondsbanseconds  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication rejected 3 in 20 ban 300 ``` | Configures login parameters to block a user.   | **Note** | Use **no aaa authentication rejected** command to revert to the default login parameters. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit ``` | Exits to privileged EXEC mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show running config  Example: ``` switch# show running config  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the login parameters. |
| **Step 5** | show aaa local user blocked  Example: ``` switch# show aaa local user blocked ``` | Displays the blocked local users. |
| **Step 6** | clear aaa local  user blocked {username user| all}  Example: ``` switch(config)# switch# clear aaa local user blocked username testuser  ``` | Clears the blocked local users.  all –Clears all the blocked local users. |
| **Step 7** | show aaa user blocked  Example: ``` switch(config)# show aaa user blocked  ``` | Displays all blocked local and remote users. |
| **Step 8** | (Optional) clear aaa user blocked{username user| all}  Example: ``` switch# clear aaa user blocked username testuser  ``` | (Optional)  Clears all blocked local and remote users.  all – Clears all the blocked local and remote users. |

#### Example

| **Note** | ---   Only network-admin, and vdc-admin have privileges to run the show and clear commands.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The following example shows how to configure the login parameters to block a user for 300 seconds when three login attempts
fail within a period of 20 seconds:

```
switch(config)# aaa authentication rejected 3 in 20 ban 300
switch# show run | i rejected
aaa authentication rejected 3 in 20 ban 300
switch# show aaa local user blocked
Local-user                 State
testuser                   Watched (till 11:34:42 IST Nov 12 2020)
switch# clear aaa local user blocked username testuser
switch# show aaa user blocked
Local-user                 State
testuser                   Watched (till 11:34:42 IST Nov 12 2020)
switch# clear aaa user blocked username testuser
```

### Enabling CHAP Authentication

The
Cisco NX-OS
software supports the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), a
challenge-response authentication protocol that uses the industry-standard
Message Digest (MD5) hashing scheme to encrypt responses. You can use CHAP for
user logins to a
Cisco NX-OS
device through a remote authentication server (RADIUS or TACACS+).

By default, the
Cisco NX-OS
device uses Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentication between the
Cisco NX-OS
device and the remote server. If you enable CHAP, you need to configure your
RADIUS or TACACS+ server to recognize the CHAP vendor-specific attributes
(VSAs).

| **Note** | ---   Cisco Nexus 9K Series switches support the CLI command, aaa authentication login ascii-authentication, only for TACAAS+, but not for RADIUS. Ensure that you have disabled aaa authentication login ascii-authentication switch so that the default authentication, PAP, is enabled. Otherwise, you will see syslog errors. For example:  ``` 2017 Jun 14 16:14:15 N9K-1 %RADIUS-2-RADIUS_NO_AUTHEN_INFO: ASCII authentication not supported 2017 Jun 14 16:14:16 N9K-1 %AUTHPRIV-3-SYSTEM_MSG: pam_aaa:Authentication failed from 192.168.12.34 - dcos_sshd[16804]  ```  --- |
| --- | --- |

This table shows
the RADIUS and TACACS+ VSAs required for CHAP.

Table 4. CHAP RADIUS and TACACS+ VSAs

| Vendor-ID Number | Vendor-Type Number | VSA | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 311 | 11 | CHAP-Challenge | Contains the challenge sent by an AAA server to a CHAP user. It can be used in both Access-Request and Access-Challenge packets. |
| 211 | 11 | CHAP-Response | Contains the response value provided by a CHAP user in response to the challenge. It is used only in Access-Request packets. |

#### Before you begin

Disable AAA ASCII
authentication for logins.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | no aaa authentication login ascii-authentication  Example: ``` switch(config)# no aaa authentication login ascii-authentication ``` | Disables ASCII authentication. |
| **Step 3** | aaa authentication login chap enable  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication login chap enable ``` | Enables CHAP authentication. The default is disabled.   | **Note** | You cannot enable both CHAP and MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 on your Cisco NX-OS device. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | (Optional)  Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show aaa authentication login chap  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication login chap ``` | (Optional)  Displays the CHAP configuration. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Enabling MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 Authentication

Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MSCHAP) is the Microsoft
version of CHAP. The Cisco NX-OS software also supports MSCHAP Version 2 (MSCHAP V2). You can use MSCHAP for user
logins to a Cisco NX-OS device through a remote authentication server (RADIUS or TACACS+). MSCHAP V2 only
supports user logins to a Cisco NX-OS device through remote authentication RADIUS servers. If you configure a TACACS+
group with MSCHAP V2, the AAA default login authentication uses the next configured
method, or the local method, if no other server group is configured.

| **Note** | ---   The Cisco NX-OS software may display the following message:  “ Warning: MSCHAP V2 is supported only with Radius.”  This warning message is informational only and does not affect MSCHAP V2 operation with RADIUS.   --- |
| --- | --- |

By default, the Cisco NX-OS device uses Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentication between the Cisco NX-OS device and the remote server. If you enable MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2, you need to
configure your RADIUS server to recognize the MSCHAP and MSCHAP V2 vendor-specific
attributes (VSAs).

This table shows the RADIUS VSAs required for MSCHAP.

Table 5. MSCHAP and MSCHAP V2 RADIUS VSAs

| Vendor-ID Number | Vendor-Type Number | VSA | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 311 | 11 | MSCHAP-Challenge | Contains the challenge sent by an AAA server to an MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 user. It can be used in both Access-Request and Access-Challenge packets. |
| 211 | 11 | MSCHAP-Response | Contains the response value provided by an MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 user in response to the challenge. It is only used in Access-Request packets. |

#### Before you begin

Disable AAA ASCII authentication for logins.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | no aaa authentication login ascii-authentication  Example: ``` switch(config)# no aaa authentication login ascii-authentication ``` | Disables ASCII authentication. |
| **Step 3** | aaa authentication login {mschap | mschapv2} enable  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication login mschap enable ``` | Enables MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 authentication. The default is disabled.   | **Note** | You cannot enable both MSCHAP and MSCHAP V2 on your Cisco NX-OS device. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show aaa authentication login {mschap | mschapv2}  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication login mschap ``` | (Optional)  Displays the MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 configuration. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring AAA Authorization on LDAP Servers

You can configure the default AAA authorization method for LDAP servers.

#### Before you begin

Enable LDAP.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authorization ssh-certificate default {group group-list [none] | local | none}  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authorization ssh-certificate default group ldap1 ldap2 ``` | Configures the default AAA authorization method for the LDAP servers.  The ssh-certificate  keyword configures LDAP or local authorization with certificate authentication. The default authorization is local authorization, which is the list of authorized commands for the user’s assigned role.  The group-list argument consists of a space-delimited list of LDAP server group names. Servers belonging to this group are contacted for AAA authorization. The local  method uses the local database for authorization, and the none  method specifies that no AAA authorization be used. |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits global configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa authorization [all]  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authorization ``` | (Optional)  Displays the AAA authorization configuration. The all  keyword displays the default values. |

### Configuring AAA Accounting Default Methods

Cisco NX-OS
software supports TACACS+ and RADIUS methods for accounting.
Cisco NX-OS
devices report user activity to TACACS+ or RADIUS security servers in the form
of accounting records. Each accounting record contains accounting
attribute-value (AV) pairs and is stored on the AAA server.

When you activate
AAA accounting, the
Cisco NX-OS
device reports these attributes as accounting records, which are then stored in
an accounting log on the security server.

You can create
default method lists defining specific accounting methods, which include the
following:

RADIUS server
group

Uses the global
pool of RADIUS servers for accounting.

Specified
server group

Uses a
specified RADIUS or TACACS+ server group for accounting.

Local

Uses the local
username or password database for accounting.

| **Note** | ---   If you have configured server groups and the server groups do not respond, by default, the local database is used for authentication.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Configure RADIUS or
TACACS+ server groups, as needed.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa accounting default {group group-list  | local}  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa accounting default group radius ``` | Configures the default accounting method.  The group-list argument consists of a space-delimited list of group names. The group names are the following:   * radius —Uses the global pool of RADIUS servers for   accounting. * named-group—Uses a   named subset of TACACS+ or RADIUS servers for accounting.   The local  method uses the local database for accounting.  The default method is local , which is used when no server groups are configured or when all the configured server groups fail to respond. |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa accounting  Example: ``` switch# show aaa accounting  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the configuration AAA accounting default methods. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Using AAA Server VSAs with Cisco NX-OS Devices

You can use
vendor-specific attributes (VSAs) to specify
Cisco NX-OS
user roles and SNMPv3 parameters on AAA servers.

* [About VSAs](#con_1235766)
* [VSA Format](#con_1235775)
* [Specifying Cisco NX-OS User Roles and SNMPv3 Parameters on AAA Servers](#con_1235794)

#### About VSAs

The Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft standard specifies a method for
communicating VSAs between the network access server and the RADIUS server. The
IETF uses attribute 26. VSAs allow vendors to support their own extended
attributes that are not suitable for general use. The Cisco RADIUS
implementation supports one vendor-specific option using the format recommended
in the specification. The Cisco vendor ID is 9, and the supported option is
vendor type 1, which is named cisco-av-pair. The value is a string with the
following format:

```
protocol : attribute separator value *

```

The protocol is a
Cisco attribute for a particular type of authorization, the separator is =
(equal sign) for mandatory attributes, and \* (asterisk) indicates optional
attributes.

When you use RADIUS
servers for authentication on a
Cisco NX-OS
device, the RADIUS protocol directs the RADIUS server to return user
attributes, such as authorization information, along with authentication
results. This authorization information is specified through VSAs.

#### VSA Format

The following VSA
protocol options are supported by the
Cisco NX-OS
software:

Shell

Protocol used
in access-accept packets to provide user profile information.

Accounting

Protocol used
in accounting-request packets. If a value contains any white spaces, put it
within double quotation marks.

The following
attributes are supported by the
Cisco NX-OS
software:

roles

Lists all the
roles assigned to the user. The value field is a string that stores the list of
group names delimited by white space. For example, if you belong to role
network-operator and network-admin, the value field would be network-operator
network-admin. This subattribute is sent in the VSA portion of the
Access-Accept frames from the RADIUS server, and it can only be used with the
shell protocol value. These examples use the roles attribute:

```
shell:roles=network-operator network-admin
```
```
shell:roles*network-operator network-admin

```

The following
examples show the roles attribute as supported by FreeRADIUS:

```
Cisco-AVPair = shell:roles=\network-operator network-admin\
```
```
Cisco-AVPair = shell:roles*\network-operator network-admin\

```

| **Note** | ---   When you specify a VSA as shell:roles\*"network-operator network-admin" or "shell:roles\*\"network-operator network-admin\"", this VSA is flagged as an optional attribute and other Cisco devices ignore this attribute.   --- |
| --- | --- |

accountinginfo

Stores
accounting information in addition to the attributes covered by a standard
RADIUS accounting protocol. This attribute is sent only in the VSA portion of
the Account-Request frames from the RADIUS client on the switch, and it can
only be used with the accounting protocol-related PDUs.

#### Specifying Cisco NX-OS User Roles and SNMPv3 Parameters on AAA Servers

You can use the VSA
cisco-av-pair on AAA servers to specify user role mapping for the
Cisco NX-OS
device using this format:

```
shell:roles="roleA roleB …"

```

If you do not
specify the role option in the cisco-av-pair attribute, the default user role
is network-operator.

The SNMPv3 attributes should come together, either before the shell attributes or after. You can also specify your SNMPv3
authentication and privacy protocol attributes as follows:

```
snmpv3:auth=”SHA” priv=”AES-128” shell:roles="network-admin" shell:priv-lvl=15

shell:roles="network-admin" shell:priv-lvl=15 snmpv3:auth=”SHA” priv=”AES-128”

```

The SNMPv3
authentication protocol options are SHA and MD5. The privacy protocol options
are AES-128 and DES. If you do not specify these options in the cisco-av-pair
attribute, MD5 and DES are the default authentication protocols.

#### Configuring Login Parameters

You can configure
login parameters to automatically block further login attempts when a possible
denial-of-service (DoS) attack is detected and slow down dictionary attacks by
enforcing a quiet period if multiple failed connection attempts are detected.

| **Note** | ---   This feature restarts if a system switchover occurs or the AAA process restarts.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   The login block-for and login quiet-mode configuration mode commands have been renamed to system login block-for and system login quiet-mode, respectively.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | [no] system login block-for seconds attempts tries within seconds  Example: ``` switch(config)# system  login block-for 100 attempts 2 within 60 ``` | Configures the quiet mode time period. The range for all arguments is from 1 to 65535.  The example shows how to configure the switch to enter a 100-second quiet period if 2 failed login attempts are exceeded within 60 seconds.  After you enter this command, all login attempts made through Telnet or SSH are denied during the quiet period. Access control lists (ACLs) are not exempt from the quiet period until the system  command is entered.   | **Note** | You must enter this command before any other login command can be used. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) [no] system login quiet-mode access-class acl-name  Example: ``` switch(config)# system  login quiet-mode access-class myacl ``` | (Optional)  Specifies an ACL that is to be applied to the switch when it changes to quiet mode. When the switch is in quiet mode, all login requests are denied, and the only available connection is through the console. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show system login [failures]  Example: ``` switch(config)# show system  login ``` | (Optional)  Displays the login parameters. The failures  option displays information related only to failed login attempts. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

#### Restricting User Login Sessions

You can restrict the
maximum number of simultaneous login sessions per user. Doing so prevents users
from having multiple unwanted sessions and solves the potential security issue
of unauthorized users accessing a valid SSH or Telnet session.

##### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | [no] user max-logins max-logins  Example: ``` switch(config)# user max-logins 1 ``` | Restricts the maximum number of simultaneous login sessions per user. The range is from 1 to 7. If you set the maximum login limit as 1, only one Telnet or SSH session is allowed per user.   | **Note** | The configured login limit applies to all users. You cannot set a different limit for individual users. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) show running-config all | i max-login  Example: ``` switch(config)# show running-config all | i max-login ``` | (Optional)  Displays the maximum number of login sessions allowed per user. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

#### Restricting the Password Length

You can restrict
the minimum and maximum length of the user password. This feature enables you
to increase system security by forcing the user to provide a strong password.

##### Before you begin

You must enable
password strength checking using the
password
strength-check command. If you restrict the password length but do
not enable password strength checking and the user enters a password that is
not within the restricted length, an error appears, but a user account is
created. To enforce the password length and prevent a user account from being
created, you must enable password strength checking and restrict the password
length.

##### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | [no] userpassphrase  {min-length min-length  | max-length max-length }  Example: ``` switch(config)# userpassphrase min-length 8 max-length 80  ``` | Restricts the minimum and/or maximum length of the user password. The minimum password length is from 4 to 127 characters, and the maximum password length is from 80 to 127 characters. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) show userpassphrase {length | max-length | min-length}  Example: ``` switch(config)# show userpassphrase length ``` | (Optional)  Displays the minimum and maximum length of the user password. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

#### Enabling the Password Prompt for the Username

You can configure
the switch to prompt the user to enter a password after entering the username.

##### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | password prompt username  Example: ``` switch(config)# password prompt username Password prompt username is enabled. After providing the required options in the username command, press enter. User will be prompted for the username password and password will be hidden. Note: Choosing password key in the same line while configuring user account, password will not be hidden.  ``` | Configures the switch to prompt the user to enter a password after she enters the username command without the password option or the snmp-server user command. The password that the user enters will be hidden. You can use the no form of this command to disable this feature. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

#### Configuring the Shared Secret for RADIUS or TACACS+

The shared secret
that you configure for remote authentication and accounting between the switch
and the RADIUS or TACACS+ server should be hidden because it is sensitive
information. You can use a separate command to generate an encrypted shared
secret for the
radius-server [host]
key  and
tacacs-server [host]
key  commands. The SHA256 hashing method is used to
store the encrypted shared secret.

##### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | generate type7\_encrypted\_secret  Example: ``` switch(config)# generate type7_encrypted_secret Type-7 (Vigenere) Encryption,  Use this encrypted secret to configure radius and tacacs shared secret with key type 7.  Copy complete secret with double quotes.  Enter plain text secret:  Confirm plain text secret:  Type 7 Encrypted secret is : "fewhg"  ``` | Configures the RADIUS or TACACS+ shared secret with key type 7. You are prompted to enter the shared secret in plain text twice. The secret is hidden as you enter it. Then an encrypted version of the secret appears.   | **Note** | You can generate the encrypted equivalent of a plain-text secret separately and configure the encrypted shared secret later using the radius-server [host] key  and tacacs-server [host] key  commands. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

## Monitoring and Clearing the Local AAA Accounting Log

The
Cisco NX-OS
device maintains a local log for the AAA accounting activity. You can monitor
this log and clear it.

### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | show accounting log [size | last-index | start-seqnum number | start-time year month day hh:mm:ss]  Example: ``` switch# show accounting log ``` | Displays the accounting log contents. By default, the command output contains up to 250,000 bytes of the accounting log. You can use the size argument to limit command output. The range is from 0 to 250000 bytes. You can also specify a starting sequence number or a starting time for the log output.The range of the starting index is from 1 to 1000000. Use the last-index  keyword to display the value of the last index number in the accounting log file. |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) clear accounting log [logflash]  Example: ``` switch# clear aaa accounting log ``` | (Optional)  Clears the accounting log contents. The logflash  keyword clears the accounting log stored in the logflash. |

## Verifying the AAA Configuration

To display AAA
configuration information, perform one of the following tasks:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| show aaa accounting | Displays AAA accounting configuration. |
| show aaa authentication [login {ascii-authentication | chap | error-enable | mschap | mschapv2}] | Displays AAA authentication login configuration information. |
| show aaa groups | Displays the AAA server group configuration. |
| show login [failures] | Displays the login parameters. The failures  option displays information related only to failed login attempts.   | **Note** | The clear login failures command clears the login failures in the current watch period. | | --- | --- | |
| show login on-failure log | Displays whether the switch is configured to log failed authentication messages to the syslog server. |
| show login on-successful log | Displays whether the switch is configured to log successful authentication messages to the syslog server. |
| show running-config aaa [all] | Displays the AAA configuration in the running configuration. |
| show running-config all | i max-login | Displays the maximum number of login sessions allowed per user. |
| show startup-config aaa | Displays the AAA configuration in the startup configuration. |
| show userpassphrase {length | max-length | min-length} | Displays the minimum and maximum length of the user password. |

## Configuration Examples for AAA

The following
example shows how to configure AAA:

```

aaa authentication login default group radius
aaa authentication login console group radius
aaa accounting default group radius

```

## Configuration Examples for Login Parameters

The following example
shows how to configure the switch to enter a 100-second quiet period if 3
failed login attempts is exceeded within 60 seconds. This example shows no
login failures.

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# login block-for 100 attempts 3 within 60
switch(config)# show login

No Quiet-Mode access list has been configured, default ACL will be applied.

 Switch is enabled to watch for login Attacks.
 If more than 3 login failures occur in 60 seconds or less,
 logins will be disabled for 100 seconds.

 Switch presently in Normal-Mode.
 Current Watch Window remaining time 45 seconds.
 Present login failure count 0.

switch(config)# show login failures
*** No logged failed login attempts with the device.***

```

The following example
shows how to configure a quiet-mode ACL. All login requests are denied during
the quiet period except hosts from the myacl ACL. This example also shows a
login failure.

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# login block-for 100 attempts 3 within 60
switch(config)# login quiet-mode access-class myacl

switch(config)# show login

 Switch is enabled to watch for login Attacks.
 If more than 3 login failures occur in 60 seconds or less,
 logins will be disabled for 100 seconds.

 Switch presently in Quiet-Mode.
 Will remain in Quiet-Mode for 98 seconds.
 Denying logins from all sources.

switch(config)# show login failures

## Configuration Examples for the Password Prompt Feature

The following example shows how to
configure the switch to prompt the user to enter a password after she enters
the
username command and the error message that displays
if she does not enter a password.

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# password prompt username
Password prompt username is enabled.
After providing the required options in the username command, press enter.
User will be prompted for the username password and password will be hidden.
Note: Choosing password key in the same line while configuring user account, password will not be hidden.

switch(config)# username user1
Enter password:
Confirm password:
warning: password for user:user1 not set. S/he may not be able to login

```

The following example shows how to configure the switch to prompt the
user to enter a password after she enters the
snmp-server user command and the prompts that then
display to the user.

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# password prompt username
Password prompt username is enabled.
After providing the required options in the username command, press enter.
User will be prompted for the username password and password will be hidden.

"text": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the system login block-for command for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a login process to unexpectedly restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to a logic error in the implementation of the system login block-for command when an attack is detected and acted upon. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a login process to reload, which could result in a delay during authentication to the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the August 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: August 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74640\"]."

At the time of publication, this vulnerability applied to both forms of the command.\r\n\r\nFor information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the Fixed Software [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-ipv6-netstack-edXPGV7K#fs\"] section of this advisory. See the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.\r\n Determine the Device Configuration\r\nNX-OS Software\r\n\r\nTo determine whether an affected device is configured with the login block-for or system login block-for CLI command, use the show running-config | include block-for command from the Cisco NX-OS CLI. If this command returns output, the device is considered vulnerable. The following example shows the output of the show running-config | include block-for command if the system login block-for command is configured on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software:\r\n\r\n\r\nnexus# show running-config | include block-for\r\nsystem login block-for 30 attempts 20 within 120\r\n\r\nUCS Software\r\n\r\nTo determine whether a UCS 6200 Series or 6300 Series Fabric Interconnect is configured to block login requests, use the Cisco UCS Manager web UI to perform the following steps:\r\n\r\nGo to the Navigation pane and click Admin.\r\nChoose Expand All > User Management > User Services > Login Profile.\r\nGo to the Work pane and see the setting of the Enable radio button in the Admin State field. If the Enable radio button is selected, the device is considered vulnerable.\r\n\r\nThe Login Profile configuration is disabled by default."

"text": "When considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security\_vulnerability\_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Cisco NX-OS Software\r\nTo help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).\r\n\r\nCustomers can use the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] to search advisories in the following ways:\r\n\r\nChoose the software, platform, and one or more releases\r\nUpload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases\r\nEnter the output of the show version command\r\n\r\nAfter initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.\r\n\r\nCustomers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release—for example, 7.0(3)I7(5) for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or 14.0(1h) for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:\r\n Cisco NX-OS Software Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches Nexus 1000V Series Switches Nexus 3000 Series Switches Nexus 5000 Series Switches Nexus 6000 Series Switches Nexus 7000 Series Switches Nexus 9000 Series Switches\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBy default, the Cisco Software Checker [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x\"] includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the Medium check box in the drop-down list under Impact Rating when customizing a search.\r\n Cisco UCS Software\r\nAt the time of publication, the release information in the following table(s) was accurate.

# Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x)

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

Cisco NX-OS
devices.

### AAA Security Services

The AAA feature
allows you to verify the identity of, grant access to, and track the actions of
users managing a Cisco NX-OS device. Cisco NX-OS devices support Remote Access
Dial-In User Service (RADIUS) or Terminal Access Controller Access Control
System Plus (TACACS+) protocols.

Based on the user ID
and password combination that you provide, Cisco NX-OS devices perform local
authentication or authorization using the local database or remote
authentication or authorization using one or more AAA servers. A preshared
secret key provides security for communication between the Cisco NX-OS device
and AAA servers. You can configure a common secret key for all AAA servers or
for only a specific AAA server.

AAA security
provides the following services:

Authentication

 Identifies
users, including login and password dialog, challenge and response, messaging
support, and, depending on the security protocol that you select, encryption.

Authentication
is the process of verifying the identity of the person or device accessing the
Cisco NX-OS device, which is based on the user ID and password combination
provided by the entity trying to access the Cisco NX-OS device. Cisco NX-OS
devices allow you to perform local authentication (using the local lookup
database) or remote authentication (using one or more RADIUS or TACACS+
servers).

Authorization

Provides access
control.AAA authorization is the process of assembling a set of attributes that
describe what the user is authorized to perform. Authorization in the Cisco
NX-OS software is provided by attributes that are downloaded from AAA servers.
Remote security servers, such as RADIUS and TACACS+, authorize users for
specific rights by associating attribute-value (AV) pairs, which define those
rights with the appropriate user.

Accounting

Provides the
method for collecting information, logging the information locally, and sending
the information to the AAA server for billing, auditing, and reporting.

The accounting
feature tracks and maintains a log of every management session used to access
the Cisco NX-OS device. You can use this information to generate reports for
troubleshooting and auditing purposes. You can store accounting logs locally or
send them to remote AAA servers.

| **Note** | ---   The Cisco NX-OS software supports authentication, authorization, and accounting independently. For example, you can configure authentication and authorization without configuring accounting.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Benefits of Using AAA

AAA provides the
following benefits:

* Increased
  flexibility and control of access configuration
* Scalability
* Standardized
  authentication methods, such as RADIUS and TACACS+
* Multiple backup
  devices

### Remote AAA Services

Remote AAA services
provided through RADIUS and TACACS+ protocols have the following advantages
over local AAA services:

* It is easier to
  manage user password lists for each
  Cisco NX-OS
  device in the fabric.
* AAA servers are
  already deployed widely across enterprises and can be easily used for AAA
  services.
* You can
  centrally manage the accounting log for all
  Cisco NX-OS
  devices in the fabric.
* It is easier to
  manage user attributes for each
  Cisco NX-OS
  device in the fabric than using the local databases on the
  Cisco NX-OS
  devices.

### AAA Server Groups

You can specify remote AAA servers for authentication, authorization, and accounting using server groups. A server group is
a set of remote AAA servers that implements the same AAA protocol. The purpose of a server group is to provide for failover
servers in case a remote AAA server fails to respond. If the first remote server in the group fails to respond, the next remote
server in the group is tried until one of the servers sends a response. If all the AAA servers in the server group fail to
respond, then that server group option is considered a failure. If required, you can specify multiple server groups. If the
Cisco NX-OS device encounters errors from the servers in the first group, it tries the servers in the next server group.

### AAA Service Configuration Options

The AAA
configuration in
Cisco NX-OS
devices is service based, which means that you can have separate AAA
configurations for the following services:

* User Telnet or
  Secure Shell (SSH) login authentication
* Console login
  authentication
* User management
  session accounting

This table
provides the related CLI command for each AAA service configuration option.

Table 1.  AAA Service
Configuration Commands

| AAA Service Configuration Option | Related Command |
| --- | --- |
| Telnet or SSH login | aaa authentication login default |
| Console login | aaa authentication login console |
| User session accounting | aaa accounting default |

You can specify
the following authentication methods for the AAA services:

All RADIUS
servers

Uses the
global pool of RADIUS servers for authentication.

Specified
server groups

Uses specified
RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP server groups you have configured for authentication.

Local

Uses the local
username or password database for authentication.

None

Specifies that
no AAA authentication be used.

| **Note** | ---   If you specify the all RADIUS servers method, rather than a specified server group method, the Cisco NX-OS device chooses the RADIUS server from the global pool of configured RADIUS servers, in the order of configuration. Servers from this global pool are the servers that can be selectively configured in a RADIUS server group on the Cisco NX-OS device.   --- |
| --- | --- |

This table shows
the AAA authentication methods that you can configure for the AAA services.

Table 2.
AAA
Authentication Methods for AAA Services

| AAA Service | AAA Methods |
| --- | --- |
| Console login authentication | Server groups, local, and none |
| User login authentication | Server groups, local, and none |
| User management session accounting | Server groups and local |

| **Note** | ---   For console login authentication, user login authentication, and user management session accounting, the Cisco NX-OS device tries each option in the order specified. The local option is the default method when other configured options fail. You can disable the local option for the console or default login by using the no aaa authentication login {console | default} fallback error local command.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Authentication and Authorization Process for User Login

Figure 1.  Authorization
and Authentication Flow for User Login. This figure
shows a flow chart of the authentication and authorization process for user
login.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/190001-200000/197001-198000/197006.eps/_jcr_content/renditions/197006.jpg)

The following list
explains the process:

* When you log in
  to the required
  Cisco NX-OS
  device, you can use the Telnet, SSH, or console login options.
* When you have
  configured the AAA server groups using the server group authentication method,
  the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device sends an authentication request to the first AAA server in the group as
  follows:

  + If the AAA
    server fails to respond, the next AAA server is tried and so on until the
    remote server responds to the authentication request.
  + If all AAA
    servers in the server group fail to respond, the servers in the next server
    group are tried.
  + If all
    configured methods fail, the local database is used for authentication, unless
    fallback to local is disabled for the console login.
* If the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device successfully authenticates you through a remote AAA server, then the
  following possibilities apply:

  + If the AAA
    server protocol is RADIUS, then user roles specified in the cisco-av-pair
    attribute are downloaded with an authentication response.
  + If the AAA
    server protocol is TACACS+, then another request is sent to the same server to
    get the user roles specified as custom attributes for the shell.
* If your username
  and password are successfully authenticated locally, the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device logs you in and assigns you the roles configured in the local database.

| **Note** | ---   "No more server groups left" means that there is no response from any server in all server groups. "No more servers left" means that there is no response from any server within this server group.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### AES Password Encryption and Primary Encryption Keys

You can enable strong, reversible 128-bit Advanced Encryption Standard (AES) password encryption, also known as type-6 encryption.
To start using type-6 encryption, you must enable the AES password encryption feature and configure a primary encryption key,
which is used to encrypt and decrypt passwords.

After you enable AES password encryption and configure a primary key, all existing and newly created clear-text passwords
for supported applications (currently RADIUS and TACACS+) are stored in type-6 encrypted format, unless you disable type-6
password encryption. You can also configure Cisco NX-OS to convert all existing weakly encrypted passwords to type-6 encrypted passwords.

## Prerequisites for AAA

Remote AAA servers
have the following prerequisites:

* Ensure that at
  least one RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP server is reachable through IP.
* Ensure that the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device is configured as a client of the AAA servers.
* Ensure that the
  secret key is configured on the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device and the remote AAA servers.
* Ensure that the
  remote server responds to AAA requests from the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device.

## Guidelines and Limitations for AAA

AAA has the following guidelines and limitations:

* If you have a user account that is configured on the local Cisco NX-OS device that has the same name as a remote user account on an AAA server, the Cisco NX-OS software applies the user roles for the local user account to the remote user, not the user roles configured on the AAA server.
* Cisco Nexus 9000 Series switches support the aaa authentication login ascii-authentication  command only for TACACS+ (and not for RADIUS).
* If you modify the default login authentication method (without using the local  keyword), the configuration overrides the console login authentication method. To explicitly configure the console authentication
  method, use the aaa authentication login console {group
  group-list [none] | local | none}  command.
* The login block-for  and login quiet-mode  configuration mode commands are renamed to system login block-for  and system login quiet-mode , respectively.
* When you use the system login quiet-mode access-class QUIET\_LIST  command, you must ensure that the access list is correctly defined to only block the specified traffic. For example, if you
  need to block only the user logins from untrusted hosts, then the access list should specify ports 22, 23, 80, and 443 corresponding
  to SSH, telnet, and HTTP-based access from those hosts.

## Configuring AAA

This section
describes the tasks for configuring AAA on
Cisco NX-OS
devices.

| **Note** | ---   If you are familiar with the Cisco IOS CLI, be aware that the Cisco NX-OS commands for this feature might differ from the Cisco IOS commands that you would use.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Cisco Nexus 9K Series switches support the CLI command, aaa authentication login ascii-authentication, only for TACAAS+, but not for RADIUS. Ensure that you have disabled aaa authentication login ascii-authentication switch so that the default authentication, PAP, is enabled. Otherwise, you will see syslog errors.   --- |

### Process for Configuring AAA

Follow these steps
to configure AAA authentication and accounting:

1. If you want to
   use remote RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP servers for authentication, configure the
   hosts on your Cisco NX-OS device.
2. Configure
   console login authentication methods.
3. Configure
   default login authentication methods for user logins.
4. Configure
   default AAA accounting default methods.

### Configuring Console Login Authentication Methods

This section
describes how to configure the authentication methods for the console login.

The authentication
methods include the following:

* Global pool of
  RADIUS servers
* Named subset of
  RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP servers
* Local database
  on the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device
* Username only
  (none)

The default method
is local, but you have
the option to disable it .

| **Note** | ---   The group radius and group server-name forms of the aaa authentication command refer to a set of previously defined RADIUS servers. Use the radius-server host  command to configure the host servers. Use the aaa group server radius  command to create a named group of servers.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  If you perform a password recovery when remote authentication is enabled, local authentication becomes enabled for console login as soon as the password recovery is done. As a result, you can log into the Cisco NX-OS device through the console port using the new password. After login, you can continue to use local authentication, or you can enable remote authentication after resetting the admin password configured at the AAA servers. For more information about the password recovery process, see the Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Troubleshooting Guide.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Configure RADIUS,
TACACS+, or LDAP server groups, as needed.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authentication login console {group group-list [none] | local | none}  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication login console group radius ``` | Configures login authentication methods for the console.  The group-list argument consists of a space-delimited list of group names. The group names are the following:  radius   Uses the global pool of RADIUS servers for authentication.  named-group  Uses a named subset of RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP servers for authentication.   The local  method uses the local database for authentication, and the none  method specifies that no AAA authentication be used.  The default console login method is local , which is used when no methods are configured or when all the configured methods fail to respond, unless fallback to local is disabled for the console login . |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa authentication  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication ``` | (Optional)  Displays the configuration of the console login authentication methods. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring Default Login Authentication Methods

The authentication
methods include the following:

* Global pool of
  RADIUS servers
* Named subset of
  RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP servers
* Local database
  on the
  Cisco NX-OS
  device
* Username only

The default method
is local, but you have
the option to disable it .

#### Before you begin

Configure RADIUS,
TACACS+, or LDAP server groups, as needed.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authentication login default {group group-list [none] | local | none}  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication login default group radius ``` | Configures the default authentication methods.  The group-list argument consists of a space-delimited list of group names. The group names are the following:   * radius —Uses the global pool of RADIUS servers for   authentication. * named-group—Uses a   named subset of RADIUS, TACACS+, or LDAP servers for authentication.   The local  method uses the local database for authentication, and the none  method specifies that no AAA authentication be used. The default login method is local , which is used when no methods are configured or when all the configured methods fail to respond, unless fallback to local is disabled for the console login .  You can configure one of the following:   * AAA authentication groups * AAA authentication groups with no authentication * Local authentication * No authentication  | **Note** | The local  keyword is not supported (and is not required) when configuring AAA authentication groups because local authentication is the default if remote servers are unreachable. For example, if you configure aaa authentication login default group g1 , local authentication is tried if you are unable to authenticate using AAA group g1. In contrast, if you configure aaa authentication login default group g1 none , no authentication is performed if you are unable to authenticate using AAA group g1. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa authentication  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication ``` | (Optional)  Displays the configuration of the default login authentication methods. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Disabling Fallback to Local Authentication

By default, if remote authentication is configured for console or default login and
all AAA servers are unreachable (resulting in an authentication error), the Cisco NX-OS device falls back to local authentication to ensure that users aren’t locked out
of the device. However, you can disable fallback to local authentication in order to
increase security.

| **Caution** | ---   Disabling fallback to local authentication can lock your Cisco NX-OS device, forcing you to perform a password recovery in order to gain access. To prevent being locked out of the device, we recommend that you disable fallback to local authentication for only the default login or the console login, not both.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Configure remote authentication for the console or default login.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | no aaa authentication login {console | default} fallback error local  Example: ``` switch(config)# no aaa authentication login console fallback error local ``` | Disables fallback to local authentication for the console or default login if remote authentication is configured and all AAA servers are unreachable.  The following message appears when you disable fallback to local authentication:  ``` “WARNING!!! Disabling fallback can lock your switch.” ``` |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | (Optional)  Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa authentication  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication ``` | (Optional)  Displays the configuration of the console and default login authentication methods. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Enabling the Default User Role for AAA Authentication

You can allow remote
users who do not have a user role to log in to the
Cisco NX-OS
device through a RADIUS or TACACS+ remote authentication server using a default
user role. When you disable the AAA default user role feature, remote users who
do not have a user role cannot log in to the device.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa user default-role  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa user default-role ``` | Enables the default user role for AAA authentication. The default is enabled.  You can disable the default user role feature by using the no  form of this command. |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa user default-role  Example: ``` switch# show aaa user default-role ``` | (Optional)  Displays the AAA default user role configuration. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Enabling Login Authentication Failure Messages

When you log in, the
login is processed by rolling over to the local user database if the remote AAA
servers do not respond. In such cases, the following messages display on the
user’s terminal if you have enabled login failure messages:

```
Remote AAA servers unreachable; local authentication done.
```
```
Remote AAA servers unreachable; local authentication failed.
```

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authentication login error-enable  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication login error-enable ``` | Enables login authentication failure messages. The default is disabled. |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa authentication  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication ``` | (Optional)  Displays the login failure message configuration. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Logging Successful and Failed Login Attempts

You can configure the switch to log all
successful and failed login attempts to the configured syslog server.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | [no] login on-failure log  Example: ``` switch(config)# login on-failure log ``` | Logs all failed authentication messages to the configured syslog server only if the logging level is set to 6. With this configuration, the following syslog message appears after the failed login:  AUTHPRIV-3-SYSTEM\_MSG: pam\_aaa:Authentication failed for user admin from 172.22.00.00   | **Note** | When logging level authpriv is 6, additional Linux kernel authentication messages appear along with the previous message. If these additional messages need to be ignored, the authpriv value should be set to 3. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | [no] login on-success log  Example: ``` switch(config)# login on-success log switch(config)# logging level authpriv 6 switch(config)# logging level daemon 6  ``` | Logs all successful authentication messages to the configured syslog server only if the logging level is set to 6. With this configuration, the following syslog message appears after the successful login:  AUTHPRIV-6-SYSTEM\_MSG: pam\_aaa:Authentication success for user admin from 172.22.00.00   | **Note** | When logging level authpriv is 6, additional Linux kernel authentication messages appear along with the previous message. If these additional messages need to be ignored, the authpriv value should be set to 3. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show login on-failure log  Example: ``` switch(config)# show login on-failure log  ``` | (Optional)  Displays whether the switch is configured to log failed authentication messages to the syslog server. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show login on-successful log  Example: ``` switch(config)# show login on-successful log  ``` | (Optional)  Displays whether the switch is configured to log successful authentication messages to the syslog server. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring Login Block Per User

Ensure that the switch is in global configuration mode.

The Login Block Per User feature helps detect suspected Denial of Service (DoS) attacks and to slow down dictionary attacks.
This feature is applicable for local users and remote users. Use this task to configure login parameters to block a user after
failed login attempts.

| **Note** | ---   From Release 9.3(7), you can configure login block for remote users.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authentication rejected attemptsinsecondsbanseconds  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication rejected 3 in 20 ban 300 ``` | Configures login parameters to block a user.   | **Note** | Use **no aaa authentication rejected** command to revert to the default login parameters. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit ``` | Exits to privileged EXEC mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show running config  Example: ``` switch# show running config  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the login parameters. |
| **Step 5** | show aaa local user blocked  Example: ``` switch# show aaa local user blocked ``` | Displays the blocked local users. |
| **Step 6** | clear aaa local  user blocked {username user| all}  Example: ``` switch(config)# switch# clear aaa local user blocked username testuser  ``` | Clears the blocked local users.  all –Clears all the blocked local users. |
| **Step 7** | show aaa user blocked  Example: ``` switch(config)# show aaa user blocked  ``` | Displays all blocked local and remote users. |
| **Step 8** | (Optional) clear aaa user blocked{username user| all}  Example: ``` switch# clear aaa user blocked username testuser  ``` | (Optional)  Clears all blocked local and remote users.  all – Clears all the blocked local and remote users. |

#### Example

| **Note** | ---   Only network-admin, and vdc-admin have privileges to run the show and clear commands.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The following example shows how to configure the login parameters to block a user for 300 seconds when three login attempts
fail within a period of 20 seconds:

```
switch(config)# aaa authentication rejected 3 in 20 ban 300
switch# show run | i rejected
aaa authentication rejected 3 in 20 ban 300
switch# show aaa local user blocked
Local-user                 State
testuser                   Watched (till 11:34:42 IST Nov 12 2020)
switch# clear aaa local user blocked username testuser
switch# show aaa user blocked
Local-user                 State
testuser                   Watched (till 11:34:42 IST Nov 12 2020)
switch# clear aaa user blocked username testuser
```

### Enabling CHAP Authentication

The
Cisco NX-OS
software supports the Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (CHAP), a
challenge-response authentication protocol that uses the industry-standard
Message Digest (MD5) hashing scheme to encrypt responses. You can use CHAP for
user logins to a
Cisco NX-OS
device through a remote authentication server (RADIUS or TACACS+).

By default, the
Cisco NX-OS
device uses Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentication between the
Cisco NX-OS
device and the remote server. If you enable CHAP, you need to configure your
RADIUS or TACACS+ server to recognize the CHAP vendor-specific attributes
(VSAs).

| **Note** | ---   Cisco Nexus 9K Series switches support the CLI command, aaa authentication login ascii-authentication, only for TACAAS+, but not for RADIUS. Ensure that you have disabled aaa authentication login ascii-authentication switch so that the default authentication, PAP, is enabled. Otherwise, you will see syslog errors. For example:  ``` 2017 Jun 14 16:14:15 N9K-1 %RADIUS-2-RADIUS_NO_AUTHEN_INFO: ASCII authentication not supported 2017 Jun 14 16:14:16 N9K-1 %AUTHPRIV-3-SYSTEM_MSG: pam_aaa:Authentication failed from 192.168.12.34 - dcos_sshd[16804]  ```  --- |
| --- | --- |

This table shows
the RADIUS and TACACS+ VSAs required for CHAP.

Table 4. CHAP RADIUS and TACACS+ VSAs

| Vendor-ID Number | Vendor-Type Number | VSA | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 311 | 11 | CHAP-Challenge | Contains the challenge sent by an AAA server to a CHAP user. It can be used in both Access-Request and Access-Challenge packets. |
| 211 | 11 | CHAP-Response | Contains the response value provided by a CHAP user in response to the challenge. It is used only in Access-Request packets. |

#### Before you begin

Disable AAA ASCII
authentication for logins.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | no aaa authentication login ascii-authentication  Example: ``` switch(config)# no aaa authentication login ascii-authentication ``` | Disables ASCII authentication. |
| **Step 3** | aaa authentication login chap enable  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication login chap enable ``` | Enables CHAP authentication. The default is disabled.   | **Note** | You cannot enable both CHAP and MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 on your Cisco NX-OS device. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | (Optional)  Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show aaa authentication login chap  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication login chap ``` | (Optional)  Displays the CHAP configuration. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Enabling MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 Authentication

Microsoft Challenge Handshake Authentication Protocol (MSCHAP) is the Microsoft
version of CHAP. The Cisco NX-OS software also supports MSCHAP Version 2 (MSCHAP V2). You can use MSCHAP for user
logins to a Cisco NX-OS device through a remote authentication server (RADIUS or TACACS+). MSCHAP V2 only
supports user logins to a Cisco NX-OS device through remote authentication RADIUS servers. If you configure a TACACS+
group with MSCHAP V2, the AAA default login authentication uses the next configured
method, or the local method, if no other server group is configured.

| **Note** | ---   The Cisco NX-OS software may display the following message:  “ Warning: MSCHAP V2 is supported only with Radius.”  This warning message is informational only and does not affect MSCHAP V2 operation with RADIUS.   --- |
| --- | --- |

By default, the Cisco NX-OS device uses Password Authentication Protocol (PAP) authentication between the Cisco NX-OS device and the remote server. If you enable MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2, you need to
configure your RADIUS server to recognize the MSCHAP and MSCHAP V2 vendor-specific
attributes (VSAs).

This table shows the RADIUS VSAs required for MSCHAP.

Table 5. MSCHAP and MSCHAP V2 RADIUS VSAs

| Vendor-ID Number | Vendor-Type Number | VSA | Description |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 311 | 11 | MSCHAP-Challenge | Contains the challenge sent by an AAA server to an MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 user. It can be used in both Access-Request and Access-Challenge packets. |
| 211 | 11 | MSCHAP-Response | Contains the response value provided by an MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 user in response to the challenge. It is only used in Access-Request packets. |

#### Before you begin

Disable AAA ASCII authentication for logins.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | no aaa authentication login ascii-authentication  Example: ``` switch(config)# no aaa authentication login ascii-authentication ``` | Disables ASCII authentication. |
| **Step 3** | aaa authentication login {mschap | mschapv2} enable  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authentication login mschap enable ``` | Enables MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 authentication. The default is disabled.   | **Note** | You cannot enable both MSCHAP and MSCHAP V2 on your Cisco NX-OS device. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show aaa authentication login {mschap | mschapv2}  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authentication login mschap ``` | (Optional)  Displays the MSCHAP or MSCHAP V2 configuration. |
| **Step 6** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring AAA Authorization on LDAP Servers

You can configure the default AAA authorization method for LDAP servers.

#### Before you begin

Enable LDAP.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa authorization ssh-certificate default {group group-list [none] | local | none}  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa authorization ssh-certificate default group ldap1 ldap2 ``` | Configures the default AAA authorization method for the LDAP servers.  The ssh-certificate  keyword configures LDAP or local authorization with certificate authentication. The default authorization is local authorization, which is the list of authorized commands for the user’s assigned role.  The group-list argument consists of a space-delimited list of LDAP server group names. Servers belonging to this group are contacted for AAA authorization. The local  method uses the local database for authorization, and the none  method specifies that no AAA authorization be used. |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits global configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa authorization [all]  Example: ``` switch# show aaa authorization ``` | (Optional)  Displays the AAA authorization configuration. The all  keyword displays the default values. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config  startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Configuring AAA Accounting Default Methods

Cisco NX-OS
software supports TACACS+ and RADIUS methods for accounting.
Cisco NX-OS
devices report user activity to TACACS+ or RADIUS security servers in the form
of accounting records. Each accounting record contains accounting
attribute-value (AV) pairs and is stored on the AAA server.

When you activate
AAA accounting, the
Cisco NX-OS
device reports these attributes as accounting records, which are then stored in
an accounting log on the security server.

You can create
default method lists defining specific accounting methods, which include the
following:

RADIUS server
group

Uses the global
pool of RADIUS servers for accounting.

Specified
server group

Uses a
specified RADIUS or TACACS+ server group for accounting.

Local

Uses the local
username or password database for accounting.

| **Note** | ---   If you have configured server groups and the server groups do not respond, by default, the local database is used for authentication.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Configure RADIUS or
TACACS+ server groups, as needed.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal switch(config)# ``` | Enters configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | aaa accounting default {group group-list  | local}  Example: ``` switch(config)# aaa accounting default group radius ``` | Configures the default accounting method.  The group-list argument consists of a space-delimited list of group names. The group names are the following:   * radius —Uses the global pool of RADIUS servers for   accounting. * named-group—Uses a   named subset of TACACS+ or RADIUS servers for accounting.   The local  method uses the local database for accounting.  The default method is local , which is used when no server groups are configured or when all the configured server groups fail to respond. |
| **Step 3** | exit  Example: ``` switch(config)# exit switch# ``` | Exits configuration mode. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show aaa accounting  Example: ``` switch# show aaa accounting  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the configuration AAA accounting default methods. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch# copy running-config startup-config ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

### Using AAA Server VSAs with Cisco NX-OS Devices

You can use
vendor-specific attributes (VSAs) to specify
Cisco NX-OS
user roles and SNMPv3 parameters on AAA servers.

* [About VSAs](#con_1235766)
* [VSA Format](#con_1235775)
* [Specifying Cisco NX-OS User Roles and SNMPv3 Parameters on AAA Servers](#con_1235794)

#### About VSAs

The Internet
Engineering Task Force (IETF) draft standard specifies a method for
communicating VSAs between the network access server and the RADIUS server. The
IETF uses attribute 26. VSAs allow vendors to support their own extended
attributes that are not suitable for general use. The Cisco RADIUS
implementation supports one vendor-specific option using the format recommended
in the specification. The Cisco vendor ID is 9, and the supported option is
vendor type 1, which is named cisco-av-pair. The value is a string with the
following format:

```
protocol : attribute separator value *

```

The protocol is a
Cisco attribute for a particular type of authorization, the separator is =
(equal sign) for mandatory attributes, and \* (asterisk) indicates optional
attributes.

When you use RADIUS
servers for authentication on a
Cisco NX-OS
device, the RADIUS protocol directs the RADIUS server to return user
attributes, such as authorization information, along with authentication
results. This authorization information is specified through VSAs.

#### VSA Format

The following VSA
protocol options are supported by the
Cisco NX-OS
software:

Shell

Protocol used
in access-accept packets to provide user profile information.

Accounting

Protocol used
in accounting-request packets. If a value contains any white spaces, put it
within double quotation marks.

The following
attributes are supported by the
Cisco NX-OS
software:

roles

Lists all the
roles assigned to the user. The value field is a string that stores the list of
group names delimited by white space. For example, if you belong to role
network-operator and network-admin, the value field would be network-operator
network-admin. This subattribute is sent in the VSA portion of the
Access-Accept frames from the RADIUS server, and it can only be used with the
shell protocol value. These examples use the roles attribute:

```
shell:roles=network-operator network-admin
```
```
shell:roles*network-operator network-admin

```

The following
examples show the roles attribute as supported by FreeRADIUS:

```
Cisco-AVPair = shell:roles=\network-operator network-admin\
```
```
Cisco-AVPair = shell:roles*\network-operator network-admin\

```

| **Note** | ---   When you specify a VSA as shell:roles\*"network-operator network-admin" or "shell:roles\*\"network-operator network-admin\"", this VSA is flagged as an optional attribute and other Cisco devices ignore this attribute.   --- |
| --- | --- |

accountinginfo

Stores
accounting information in addition to the attributes covered by a standard
RADIUS accounting protocol. This attribute is sent only in the VSA portion of
the Account-Request frames from the RADIUS client on the switch, and it can
only be used with the accounting protocol-related PDUs.

#### Specifying Cisco NX-OS User Roles and SNMPv3 Parameters on AAA Servers

You can use the VSA
cisco-av-pair on AAA servers to specify user role mapping for the
Cisco NX-OS
device using this format:

```
shell:roles="roleA roleB …"

```

If you do not
specify the role option in the cisco-av-pair attribute, the default user role
is network-operator.

The SNMPv3 attributes should come together, either before the shell attributes or after. You can also specify your SNMPv3
authentication and privacy protocol attributes as follows:

```
snmpv3:auth=”SHA” priv=”AES-128” shell:roles="network-admin" shell:priv-lvl=15

shell:roles="network-admin" shell:priv-lvl=15 snmpv3:auth=”SHA” priv=”AES-128”

```

The SNMPv3
authentication protocol options are SHA and MD5. The privacy protocol options
are AES-128 and DES. If you do not specify these options in the cisco-av-pair
attribute, MD5 and DES are the default authentication protocols.

#### Configuring Login Parameters

You can configure
login parameters to automatically block further login attempts when a possible
denial-of-service (DoS) attack is detected and slow down dictionary attacks by
enforcing a quiet period if multiple failed connection attempts are detected.

| **Note** | ---   This feature restarts if a system switchover occurs or the AAA process restarts.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   The login block-for and login quiet-mode configuration mode commands have been renamed to system login block-for and system login quiet-mode, respectively.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | [no] system login block-for seconds attempts tries within seconds  Example: ``` switch(config)# system  login block-for 100 attempts 2 within 60 ``` | Configures the quiet mode time period. The range for all arguments is from 1 to 65535.  The example shows how to configure the switch to enter a 100-second quiet period if 2 failed login attempts are exceeded within 60 seconds.  After you enter this command, all login attempts made through Telnet or SSH are denied during the quiet period. Access control lists (ACLs) are not exempt from the quiet period until the system  command is entered.   | **Note** | You must enter this command before any other login command can be used. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) [no] system login quiet-mode access-class acl-name  Example: ``` switch(config)# system  login quiet-mode access-class myacl ``` | (Optional)  Specifies an ACL that is to be applied to the switch when it changes to quiet mode. When the switch is in quiet mode, all login requests are denied, and the only available connection is through the console. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show system login [failures]  Example: ``` switch(config)# show system  login ``` | (Optional)  Displays the login parameters. The failures  option displays information related only to failed login attempts. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

#### Restricting User Login Sessions

You can restrict the
maximum number of simultaneous login sessions per user. Doing so prevents users
from having multiple unwanted sessions and solves the potential security issue
of unauthorized users accessing a valid SSH or Telnet session.

##### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | [no] user max-logins max-logins  Example: ``` switch(config)# user max-logins 1 ``` | Restricts the maximum number of simultaneous login sessions per user. The range is from 1 to 7. If you set the maximum login limit as 1, only one Telnet or SSH session is allowed per user.   | **Note** | The configured login limit applies to all users. You cannot set a different limit for individual users. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) show running-config all | i max-login  Example: ``` switch(config)# show running-config all | i max-login ``` | (Optional)  Displays the maximum number of login sessions allowed per user. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

#### Restricting the Password Length

You can restrict
the minimum and maximum length of the user password. This feature enables you
to increase system security by forcing the user to provide a strong password.

##### Before you begin

You must enable
password strength checking using the
password
strength-check command. If you restrict the password length but do
not enable password strength checking and the user enters a password that is
not within the restricted length, an error appears, but a user account is
created. To enforce the password length and prevent a user account from being
created, you must enable password strength checking and restrict the password
length.

##### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | [no] userpassphrase  {min-length min-length  | max-length max-length }  Example: ``` switch(config)# userpassphrase min-length 8 max-length 80  ``` | Restricts the minimum and/or maximum length of the user password. The minimum password length is from 4 to 127 characters, and the maximum password length is from 80 to 127 characters. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) show userpassphrase {length | max-length | min-length}  Example: ``` switch(config)# show userpassphrase length ``` | (Optional)  Displays the minimum and maximum length of the user password. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

#### Enabling the Password Prompt for the Username

You can configure
the switch to prompt the user to enter a password after entering the username.

##### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | password prompt username  Example: ``` switch(config)# password prompt username Password prompt username is enabled. After providing the required options in the username command, press enter. User will be prompted for the username password and password will be hidden. Note: Choosing password key in the same line while configuring user account, password will not be hidden.  ``` | Configures the switch to prompt the user to enter a password after she enters the username command without the password option or the snmp-server user command. The password that the user enters will be hidden. You can use the no form of this command to disable this feature. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

#### Configuring the Shared Secret for RADIUS or TACACS+

The shared secret
that you configure for remote authentication and accounting between the switch
and the RADIUS or TACACS+ server should be hidden because it is sensitive
information. You can use a separate command to generate an encrypted shared
secret for the
radius-server [host]
key  and
tacacs-server [host]
key  commands. The SHA256 hashing method is used to
store the encrypted shared secret.

##### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | configure terminal  Example: ``` switch# configure terminal ``` | Enters global configuration mode. |
| **Step 2** | generate type7\_encrypted\_secret  Example: ``` switch(config)# generate type7_encrypted_secret Type-7 (Vigenere) Encryption,  Use this encrypted secret to configure radius and tacacs shared secret with key type 7.  Copy complete secret with double quotes.  Enter plain text secret:  Confirm plain text secret:  Type 7 Encrypted secret is : "fewhg"  ``` | Configures the RADIUS or TACACS+ shared secret with key type 7. You are prompted to enter the shared secret in plain text twice. The secret is hidden as you enter it. Then an encrypted version of the secret appears.   | **Note** | You can generate the encrypted equivalent of a plain-text secret separately and configure the encrypted shared secret later using the radius-server [host] key  and tacacs-server [host] key  commands. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) copy running-config startup-config  Example: ``` switch(config)# copy running-config startup-config  ``` | (Optional)  Copies the running configuration to the startup configuration. |

## Monitoring and Clearing the Local AAA Accounting Log

The
Cisco NX-OS
device maintains a local log for the AAA accounting activity. You can monitor
this log and clear it.

### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | show accounting log [size | last-index | start-seqnum number | start-time year month day hh:mm:ss]  Example: ``` switch# show accounting log ``` | Displays the accounting log contents. By default, the command output contains up to 250,000 bytes of the accounting log. You can use the size argument to limit command output. The range is from 0 to 250000 bytes. You can also specify a starting sequence number or a starting time for the log output.The range of the starting index is from 1 to 1000000. Use the last-index  keyword to display the value of the last index number in the accounting log file. |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) clear accounting log [logflash]  Example: ``` switch# clear aaa accounting log ``` | (Optional)  Clears the accounting log contents. The logflash  keyword clears the accounting log stored in the logflash. |

## Verifying the AAA Configuration

To display AAA
configuration information, perform one of the following tasks:

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| show aaa accounting | Displays AAA accounting configuration. |
| show aaa authentication [login {ascii-authentication | chap | error-enable | mschap | mschapv2}] | Displays AAA authentication login configuration information. |
| show aaa groups | Displays the AAA server group configuration. |
| show login [failures] | Displays the login parameters. The failures  option displays information related only to failed login attempts.   | **Note** | The clear login failures command clears the login failures in the current watch period. | | --- | --- | |
| show login on-failure log | Displays whether the switch is configured to log failed authentication messages to the syslog server. |
| show login on-successful log | Displays whether the switch is configured to log successful authentication messages to the syslog server. |
| show running-config aaa [all] | Displays the AAA configuration in the running configuration. |
| show running-config all | i max-login | Displays the maximum number of login sessions allowed per user. |
| show startup-config aaa | Displays the AAA configuration in the startup configuration. |
| show userpassphrase {length | max-length | min-length} | Displays the minimum and maximum length of the user password. |

## Configuration Examples for AAA

The following
example shows how to configure AAA:

```

aaa authentication login default group radius
aaa authentication login console group radius
aaa accounting default group radius

```

## Configuration Examples for Login Parameters

The following example
shows how to configure the switch to enter a 100-second quiet period if 3
failed login attempts is exceeded within 60 seconds. This example shows no
login failures.

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# login block-for 100 attempts 3 within 60
switch(config)# show login

No Quiet-Mode access list has been configured, default ACL will be applied.

 Switch is enabled to watch for login Attacks.
 If more than 3 login failures occur in 60 seconds or less,
 logins will be disabled for 100 seconds.

 Switch presently in Normal-Mode.
 Current Watch Window remaining time 45 seconds.
 Present login failure count 0.

switch(config)# show login failures
*** No logged failed login attempts with the device.***

```

The following example
shows how to configure a quiet-mode ACL. All login requests are denied during
the quiet period except hosts from the myacl ACL. This example also shows a
login failure.

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# login block-for 100 attempts 3 within 60
switch(config)# login quiet-mode access-class myacl

switch(config)# show login

 Switch is enabled to watch for login Attacks.
 If more than 3 login failures occur in 60 seconds or less,
 logins will be disabled for 100 seconds.

 Switch presently in Quiet-Mode.
 Will remain in Quiet-Mode for 98 seconds.
 Denying logins from all sources.

switch(config)# show login failures
Information about last 20 login failure's with the device.

```

## Configuration Examples for the Password Prompt Feature

The following example shows how to
configure the switch to prompt the user to enter a password after she enters
the
username command and the error message that displays
if she does not enter a password.

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# password prompt username
Password prompt username is enabled.
After providing the required options in the username command, press enter.
User will be prompted for the username password and password will be hidden.
Note: Choosing password key in the same line while configuring user account, password will not be hidden.

switch(config)# username user1
Enter password:
Confirm password:
warning: password for user:user1 not set. S/he may not be able to login

```

The following example shows how to configure the switch to prompt the
user to enter a password after she enters the
snmp-server user command and the prompts that then
display to the user.

```
switch# configure terminal
switch(config)# password prompt username
Password prompt username is enabled.
After providing the required options in the username command, press enter.
User will be prompted for the username password and password will be hidden.
Note: Choosing password key in the same line while configuring user account, password will not be hidden.

N9K-1(config)# snmp-server user user1
Enter auth md5 password (Press Enter to Skip):
Enter auth sha password (Press Enter to Skip):

```

## Minimum Recommended Cisco NX-OS Releases for Cisco Nexus 5600 Series Switches ---

 **Date: February 13, 2023**

This document lists the minimum recommended Cisco NX-OS software release for use with Cisco Nexus 5600 Series switches for both new deployments and existing deployments. Since these are minimum release recommendations, more recent software releases can be used to take advantage of newer hardware and software capabilities. These recommendations are general and should not replace environment specific design review efforts.

 **General Recommendation for New Deployments**

Cisco recommends that customers with new Cisco Nexus 5600 Series deployments choose from the following minimum recommended releases:

Table 1 Cisco Nexus 5600 Recommended Releases

| Platform Series/Product Name | Minimum Recommended Release | Recommended Release |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco NX-OS Software system login block-for Denial of Service Vulnerability Medium   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-nxos-login-blockfor-RwjGVEcu  First Published: 2021 August 25 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCuz49095](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz49095)  [CSCvw45963](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw45963)  [CSCvx74585](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx74585)     CVE-2021-1590     CWE-787       CVSS Score: [Base 5.3](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2021-1590     CWE-787       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-login-blockfor-RwjGVEcu/csaf/cisco-sa-nxos-login-blockfor-RwjGVEcu.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the implementation of the **system login block-for** command for Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a login process to unexpectedly restart, causing a denial of service (DoS) condition.  This vulnerability is due to a logic error in the implementation of the **system login block-for** command when an attack is detected and acted upon. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a login process to reload, which could result in a delay during authentication to the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-login-blockfor-RwjGVEcu>  This advisory is part of the August 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: August 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74640).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software and had the **system login block-for** CLI command configured:    + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches ([CSCuz49095](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz49095))   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches ([CSCuz49095](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz49095))   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches ([CSCvw45963](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw45963))   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches ([CSCvw45963](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw45963))   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches ([CSCvw45963](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw45963))   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches ([CSCuz49095](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz49095))   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode ([CSCuz49095](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz49095))   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCvx74585](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx74585))   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCvx74585](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx74585)) The **system login block-for** command is disabled by default.  **Note:** The **login block-for** mode command was renamed **system login block-for** on certain Cisco NX-OS platforms and newer code trains. At the time of publication, this vulnerability applied to both forms of the command.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-ipv6-netstack-edXPGV7K#fs) section of this advisory. See the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the Device Configuration **NX-OS Software**  To determine whether an affected device is configured with the **login block-for** or **system login block-for** CLI command, use the **show running-config | include block-for** command from the Cisco NX-OS CLI. If this command returns output, the device is considered vulnerable. The following example shows the output of the **show running-config | include block-for** command if the **system login block-for** command is configured on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software:  ```   nexus# show running-config | include block-forsystem login block-for 30 attempts 20 within 120   ```  **UCS Software**  To determine whether a UCS 6200 Series or 6300 Series Fabric Interconnect is configured to block login requests, use the Cisco UCS Manager web UI to perform the following steps:    1. Go to the **Navigation** pane and click **Admin**.   2. Choose **Expand All > User Management > User Services > Login Profile**.   3. Go to the **Work** pane and see the setting of the **Enable** radio button in the **Admin State** field. If the **Enable** radio button is selected, the device is considered vulnerable. The **Login Profile** configuration is disabled by default. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * The **system login block-for** feature can detect and protect against brute-force login attacks to the device. For information about the **system login block-for** command, see [Configuring Login Parameters](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/security/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_011.html#task_794D196F3DD7430E93F14D9EEC7DE44B) in the [Configuring AAA chapter of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/security/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_011.html).  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) daemon process to crash and generate an error message that is similar to the following:  ```   %SYSMGR-2-SERVICE_CRASHED: Service "AAA Daemon" (PID 22769) hasn't caught signal 11 (core will be saved).   ```  This error message could have multiple causes. Customers who observe this message on a device are advised to contact their support organization to determine whether the message indicates that the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  The device is only vulnerable if the **system login block-for** command is configured and a potential DoS attack was detected. If the command is removed using **no [system] login block-for** *seconds* **attempts** *tries* **within** *seconds*, the device is no longer vulnerable.  However, removing the **system login block-for** configuration weakens the security posture of the device. For additional information, see [Configuring Login Parameters](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/security/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_011.html#task_794D196F3DD7430E93F14D9EEC7DE44B) in the [Configuring AAA chapter of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/security/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_011.html).  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco NX-OS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release-for example, **7.0(3)I7(5)** for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or **14.0(1h)** for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:    Cisco NX-OS Software   Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode   MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   Nexus 1000V Series Switches   Nexus 3000 Series Switches   Nexus 5000 Series Switches   Nexus 6000 Series Switches   Nexus 7000 Series Switches   Nexus 9000 Series Switches        By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.

This vulnerability exists because the software improperly releases resources when it processes certain IPv6 packets that are destined to an affected device. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending multiple crafted IPv6 packets to an affected device. A successful exploit could cause the network stack to run out of available buffers, impairing operations of control plane and management plane protocols and resulting in a DoS condition. Manual intervention would be required to restore normal operations on the affected device.  For more information about the impact of this vulnerability, see the [Details](#details) section of this advisory.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-ipv6-netstack-edXPGV7K>  This advisory is part of the February 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: February 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74414).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects the following Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software and have an IPv6 address or **ipv6 forward** configured on at least one interface:    + Nexus 3000 Series Switches ([CSCvu11961](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu11961))   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches ([CSCvu11961](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu11961))   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches ([CSCvu11961](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu11961))   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches ([CSCvu11961](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu11961))   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches ([CSCvu11961](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu11961))   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode ([CSCvu11961](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu11961))   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCvu77380](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu77380)) For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine the Status of IPv6 on Cisco NX-OS Software To determine whether a device will accept incoming IPv6 packets, use the **show ipv6 interface brief vrf** **all** command at the device CLI. A device could be affected by this vulnerability if the command returns an IPv6 interface status from at least one interface, as shown in the following example:  ```   Switch# show ipv6 interface brief vrf allIPv6 Interface Status for VRF "default"(1)Interface        IPv6 Address/Link-local Address           Interface Status                                                           prot/link/adminEth1/65          2001:db8:1:f101::1                        up/up/up                 fe80::23a:7dff:fe95:d071                     IPv6 Interface Status for VRF "management"(2)   Interface        IPv6 Address/Link-local Address           Interface Status                                                           prot/link/admin   ```  **Note:** By default, no IPv6 addresses are enabled in Cisco NX-OS Software. An interface of a Nexus device can be configured with an IPv6 address through the **ipv6 address** **[...]** or **ipv6 link-local [...]** CLI configuration commands. Also, the **ipv6 forward** CLI configuration command can be used to allow an interface to accept IPv6 packets even if no IPv6 address is configured. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * This vulnerability is due to buffers not freeing properly in the Cisco NX-OS Software network stack known as *netstack*. If an affected device runs out of available buffers, it will stop processing incoming packets for multiple management plane protocols and control plane protocols (including routing protocols). This may cause those protocols to stop working properly on the affected device, resulting in operational failures that could impact traffic and cause a DoS condition. The impact could depend on the specific platform and the software release on the device. A manual reload of the device is required to restore normal operations.  For this vulnerability to be exploited, the IPv6 traffic must be destined to an affected device. Traffic that transits an affected device cannot be used to exploit this vulnerability.  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the affected device to consume all available network stack buffers and generate error messages similar to the following:       | 2021 Jan 25 16:07:39 nexus %NETSTACK-3-MBUF\_FAILED: netstack [27340] m\_copyin() failed in ipv6\_data\_main() ... | | | | | |   | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |   | 2021 Jan 25 16:07:44 nexus %NETSTACK-3-IPV6\_API\_FAILED: netstack [27340] m\_copyin() failed in ipv6\_process\_pm\_data\_msg() | | | | | |   |  |  |  |  |  |  |       These error messages could have multiple causes. Customers who observe these messages on a device are advised to contact their support organization to determine whether the messages indicate that the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco NX-OS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release-for example, **7.0(3)I7(5)** for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or **14.0(1h)** for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:    Cisco NX-OS Software   Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode   MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   Nexus 1000V Series Switches   Nexus 3000 Series Switches   Nexus 5000 Series Switches   Nexus 6000 Series Switches   Nexus 7000 Series Switches   Nexus 9000 Series Switches        By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.

This vulnerability is due to a logic error in the implementation of the **system login block-for** command when an attack is detected and acted upon. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by performing a brute-force login attack on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a login process to reload, which could result in a delay during authentication to the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-login-blockfor-RwjGVEcu>  This advisory is part of the August 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: August 2021 Cisco FXOS and NX-OS Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74640).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco NX-OS Software and had the **system login block-for** CLI command configured:    + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches ([CSCuz49095](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz49095))   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches ([CSCuz49095](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz49095))   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches ([CSCvw45963](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw45963))   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches ([CSCvw45963](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw45963))   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches ([CSCvw45963](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw45963))   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches ([CSCuz49095](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz49095))   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode ([CSCuz49095](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCuz49095))   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCvx74585](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx74585))   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects ([CSCvx74585](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx74585)) The **system login block-for** command is disabled by default.  **Note:** The **login block-for** mode command was renamed **system login block-for** on certain Cisco NX-OS platforms and newer code trains. At the time of publication, this vulnerability applied to both forms of the command.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-ipv6-netstack-edXPGV7K#fs) section of this advisory. See the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the Device Configuration **NX-OS Software**  To determine whether an affected device is configured with the **login block-for** or **system login block-for** CLI command, use the **show running-config | include block-for** command from the Cisco NX-OS CLI. If this command returns output, the device is considered vulnerable. The following example shows the output of the **show running-config | include block-for** command if the **system login block-for** command is configured on a device that is running Cisco NX-OS Software:  ```   nexus# show running-config | include block-forsystem login block-for 30 attempts 20 within 120   ```  **UCS Software**  To determine whether a UCS 6200 Series or 6300 Series Fabric Interconnect is configured to block login requests, use the Cisco UCS Manager web UI to perform the following steps:    1. Go to the **Navigation** pane and click **Admin**.   2. Choose **Expand All > User Management > User Services > Login Profile**.   3. Go to the **Work** pane and see the setting of the **Enable** radio button in the **Admin State** field. If the **Enable** radio button is selected, the device is considered vulnerable. The **Login Profile** configuration is disabled by default. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Firepower 4100 Series   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects  Details  * The **system login block-for** feature can detect and protect against brute-force login attacks to the device. For information about the **system login block-for** command, see [Configuring Login Parameters](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/security/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_011.html#task_794D196F3DD7430E93F14D9EEC7DE44B) in the [Configuring AAA chapter of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/security/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_011.html).  Indicators of Compromise  * Exploitation of this vulnerability could cause the authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) daemon process to crash and generate an error message that is similar to the following:  ```   %SYSMGR-2-SERVICE_CRASHED: Service "AAA Daemon" (PID 22769) hasn't caught signal 11 (core will be saved).   ```  This error message could have multiple causes. Customers who observe this message on a device are advised to contact their support organization to determine whether the message indicates that the device has been compromised by exploitation of this vulnerability.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  The device is only vulnerable if the **system login block-for** command is configured and a potential DoS attack was detected. If the command is removed using **no [system] login block-for** *seconds* **attempts** *tries* **within** *seconds*, the device is no longer vulnerable.  However, removing the **system login block-for** configuration weakens the security posture of the device. For additional information, see [Configuring Login Parameters](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/security/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_011.html#task_794D196F3DD7430E93F14D9EEC7DE44B) in the [Configuring AAA chapter of Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide, Release 9.3(x)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/93x/security/configuration/guide/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x/b-cisco-nexus-9000-nx-os-security-configuration-guide-93x_chapter_011.html).  While this mitigation has been deployed and was proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco NX-OS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by choosing the Cisco NX-OS Software and platform and then entering a release-for example, **7.0(3)I7(5)** for Cisco Nexus 3000 Series Switches or **14.0(1h)** for Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI mode:    Cisco NX-OS Software   Cisco NX-OS Software in ACI Mode   MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches   Nexus 1000V Series Switches   Nexus 3000 Series Switches   Nexus 5000 Series Switches   Nexus 6000 Series Switches   Nexus 7000 Series Switches   Nexus 9000 Series Switches        By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.
