Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1602:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions `CVE-2021-1602` and details a vulnerability associated with it, confirming its relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability is caused by **insufficient user input validation** in the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business RV series routers.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Command Injection:** The lack of proper input sanitization allows for the injection of arbitrary commands into the system.
   - **Remote Command Execution:** This command injection vulnerability leads to the potential for remote command execution.
   - **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected device.
   - **Root-Level Privileges:** Commands are executed with *root*-level privileges, granting the attacker high levels of access and control.
   - **Compromised Router:** An exploited router could lead to a full compromise of the device and potentially the network it connects to.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The attack can be launched remotely through the network if remote management is enabled, or locally if the attacker is on the same LAN.
   - **Web-based management interface:** A crafted request is sent to the web management interface to exploit the vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable router's web management interface.
    - **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability does not require the attacker to authenticate to the management interface prior to exploiting it.
   - **Crafted Request:** The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious request to trigger the command injection.
  -  **Note:** only commands without parameters can be executed.

**Additional Details:**
