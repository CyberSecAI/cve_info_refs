        "vulnerability": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
        "description": "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks are a type of injection, in which malicious scripts are injected into otherwise benign and trusted websites. XSS attacks occur when an attacker uses a web application to send malicious code, generally in the form of a browser side script, to a different end user. Flaws that allow these attacks to succeed are quite widespread and occur anywhere a web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.",
        "root_cause": "Web application uses input from a user within the output it generates without validating or encoding it.",
        "weaknesses": [
          "Improper input validation",
          "Lack of output encoding"
        ],
        "impact": "An attacker can use XSS to send a malicious script to an unsuspecting user. The end user’s browser has no way to know that the script should not be trusted, and will execute the script. Because it thinks the script came from a trusted source, the malicious script can access any cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information retained by the browser and used with that site. These scripts can even rewrite the content of the HTML page.",
         "attack_vectors": [
          "Reflected XSS: Injected script is reflected off the web server, such as in an error message, search result, or any other response that includes some or all of the input sent to the server as part of the request.",
           "Stored XSS: Injected script is permanently stored on the target servers, such as in a database, in a message forum, visitor log, comment field, etc.",
          "Blind XSS:  attacker’s payload saved on the server and reflected back to the victim from the backend application. For example in feedback forms."
           ],
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code into the web application's input fields or through crafted URLs."

         "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to conduct a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) attack against a user of the interface of an affected system. The vulnerabilities exist because the web-based management interface does not properly validate user-supplied input. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by persuading a user of the interface to click a crafted link.
