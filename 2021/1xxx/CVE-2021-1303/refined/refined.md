  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to improper enforcement of actions for assigned user roles.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Improper enforcement of user role actions, leading to privilege escalation.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker with an 'Observer' role could execute commands to view diagnostic information of the devices managed by Cisco DNA Center, which is beyond the intended scope of that role.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack can be performed remotely by authenticating as a user with the 'Observer' role.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have valid credentials for a user account with at least 'Observer' privileges on the affected Cisco DNA Center system."
