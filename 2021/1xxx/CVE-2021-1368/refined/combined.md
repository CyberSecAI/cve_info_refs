Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product.

# Performing Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs)

This chapter describes
how to perform software maintenance upgrades (SMUs) on Cisco Nexus 3000 Series
switches.

This chapter includes
the following sections:

* [About SMUs](#concept_C596AB5F37B14E7E900421ECC65A10FE)
* [Prerequisites for SMUs](#concept_1C9A592AC8804A83BDFBA9AD01A9B996)
* [Guidelines and Limitations for SMUs](#concept_B0CAE971FE7948D5B8D378A015C61974)
* [Performing a Software Maintenance Upgrade for Cisco NX-OS](#concept_01FCFCB13E3444D4BD5FF8D0BBA2FC5A)

## About SMUs

A software maintenance upgrade (SMU) is a package file that contains
fixes for a specific defect. SMUs are created to respond to immediate issues
and do not include new features. Typically, SMUs do not have a large impact on
device operations. SMU versions are synchronized to the package major, minor,
and maintenance versions they upgrade.

The effect of an SMU depends on its type:

* Process restart SMU-Causes a process or group of processes to
  restart on activation.
* Reload SMU-Causes a parallel reload of supervisors and line cards.

SMUs are not an alternative to maintenance releases. They provide a
quick resolution of immediate issues. All defects fixed by SMUs are integrated
into the maintenance releases.

For information on upgrading your device to a new feature or maintenance
release, see the
Cisco Nexus 3000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade
Guide.

| **Note** | ---  Activating an SMU does not cause any earlier SMUs, or the package to which the SMU applies, to be automatically deactivated.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I2(1), SMU package files have an .rpm extension. Earlier files have a .bin extension.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Package Management](#concept_8535F7376D0F43F9A8B2C5B2E154E406)

### Package Management

The general procedure
for adding and activating SMU packages on the device is as follows:

1. Copy the package file or files to a local storage device or file server.
2. Add the package or packages on the device using the install add command.
3. Activate the package or packages on the device using the install activate command.
4. Commit the current set of packages using the install commit command.
5. (Optional) Deactivate and remove the package.

The following figure
illustrates the key steps in the package management process.

Figure 1. Process to Add,
Activate, and Commit SMU Packages

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/503001-504000/503009.jpg)

## Prerequisites for SMUs

These prerequisites must be met for a package to be activated or
deactivated:

* You must be in a user group associated with a task group that
  includes the proper task IDs. If you suspect a user group assignment is
  preventing you from using a command, contact your AAA administrator for
  assistance.
* Verify that all line cards are installed and operating properly. For
  example, do not activate or deactivate packages while line cards are booting,
  while line cards are being upgraded or replaced, or when you anticipate an
  automatic switchover activity.

## Guidelines and Limitations for SMUs

SMUs have the following guidelines and limitations:

* Some packages require the activation or deactivation of other
  packages. If the SMUs have dependencies on each other, you cannot activate them
  without first activating the previous ones.
* The package being activated must be compatible with the current
  active software set.
* You cannot activate multiple SMUs in one command.
* Activation is performed only after the package compatibility checks
  have been passed. If a conflict is found, an error message displays.
* While a software package is being activated, other requests are not
  allowed to run on any of the impacted nodes. Package activation is completed
  when a message similar to this one appears:

  ```
  Install operation 1 completed successfully at Thu Jan 9 01:19:24 2014
  ```
* Each CLI install request is assigned a request ID, which can be used
  later to review the events.
* If you perform a software maintenance upgrade and later upgrade your
  device to a new Cisco Nexus 3000 software release, the new image will overwrite
  both the previous Cisco Nexus 3000 release and the SMU package file.

### Preparing for Package Installation

You should use several
show commands to gather information in preparation
for the SMU package installation.

#### Before you begin

Determine if a software change is required.

Verify that the new package is supported on your system. Some software
packages require that other packages or package versions be activated, and some
packages support only specific line cards.

Review the release notes for important information related to that
release and to help determine the package compatibility with your device
configuration.

Verify that the system is stable and prepared for the software
changes.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | show install active  Example: ``` switch# show install active ``` | Displays the active software on the device. Use this command to determine what software should be added on the device and to compare to the active software report after installation operations are complete. |
| **Step 2** | show module  Example: ``` switch# show module ``` | Confirms that all modules are in the stable state. |
| **Step 3** | show clock  Example: ``` switch# show clock ``` | Verifies that the system clock is correct. Software operations use certificates based on device clock times. |

#### Example

This example shows how to display the active packages for the entire
system. Use this information to determine if a software change is required.

```
switch# show install active
Active Packages:
Active Packages on Module #3:

Active Packages on Module #6:

Active Packages on Module #7:
Active Packages on Module #22:

Active Packages on Module #30:

```

This example shows how to display the current system clock setting:

```
switch# show clock
02:14:51.474 PST Wed Jan 04 2014

```

### Copying the Package File to a Local Storage Device or Network Server

You must copy the SMU package file to a local storage device or a
network file server to which the device has access. After this task is done,
the package can be added and activated on the device.

If you need to store package files on the device, we recommend that you
store the files on the hard disk. The boot device is the local disk from which
the package is added and activated. The default boot device is bootflash:.

| **Tip** | ---  Before you copy package files to a local storage device, use the dir command to determine if the required package files are already on the device.  --- |
| --- | --- |

If the SMU package files are located on a remote TFTP, FTP, or SFTP
server, you can copy the files to a local storage device. After the files are
located on the local storage device, the package can be added and activated on
the device from that storage device. The following server protocols are
supported:

* Trivial File Transfer Protocol—TFTP allows files to be transferred
  from one computer to another over a network, usually without the use of client
  authentication (for example, username and password). It is a simplified version
  of FTP.

  | **Note** | ---  Some package files might be larger than 32 MB, and the TFTP services provided by some vendors might not support a file this large. If you do not have access to a TFTP server that supports files larger than 32 MB, download the file using FTP.  --- |
  | --- | --- |
* File Transfer Protocol—FTP is part of the TCP/IP protocol stack and
  requires a username and password.
* SSH File Transfer Protocol—SFTP is part of the SSHv2 feature in the
  security package and provides for secure file transfers.

After the SMU package file has been transferred to a network file server
or the local storage device, you are ready to add and activate the file.

### Adding and Activating Packages

You can add SMU package files that are stored on a local storage
device or on a remote TFTP, FTP, or SFTP server to your device.

| **Note** | ---  The SMU package being activated must be compatible with the currently active software to operate. When an activation is attempted, the system runs an automatic compatibility check to ensure that the package is compatible with the other active software on the device. If a conflict is found, an error message displays. The activation is performed only after all compatibility checks have been passed.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to add and activate RPM package files. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Installing RPMs from Bash" section of the [Cisco Nexus 3000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/programmability/7_x/b_Cisco_Nexus_3000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | install add filename [activate]  Example: ``` switch# install add bootflash: nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm  ``` | Unpacks the package software files from the local storage device or network server and adds them to the bootflash: and all active and standby supervisors installed on the device.  The filename argument can take any of these formats:   * bootflash:filename * tftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * ftp://username:password@    hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * sftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) show install inactive  Example: ``` switch# show install inactive  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the inactive packages on the device. Verify that the package added in the previous step appears in the display. |
| **Step 3** | install activate filename [test]  Example: ``` switch# install activate nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm  ```  Example: ``` switch# install activate nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm Install operation 1 completed successfully at Wed Mar 16 00:42:12 2016  ```  Example: ``` switch# install activate nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm Install operation 2 !!WARNING!! This patch will get activated only after a reload of the switch. at Wed Mar 16 00:42:12 2016  ``` | Activates a package that was added to the device. SMU packages remain inactive until activated. (Skip this step if the package was activated earlier with the install add activate command.)   | **Note** | Press **?** after a partial package name to display all possible matches available for activation. If there is only one match, press the **Tab** key to fill in the rest of the package name. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Repeat Step 3 until all packages are activated. | Activates additional packages as required. |
| **Step 5** | (Optional) show install active  Example: ``` switch# show install active  ``` | (Optional)  Displays all active packages. Use this command to determine if the correct packages are active. |

### Committing the Active Package Set

When an SMU package is activated on the device, it becomes part of the
current running configuration. To make the package activation persistent across
system-wide reloads, you must commit the package on the device.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | install commit filename  Example: ``` switch# install commit nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm ``` | Commits the current set of packages so that these packages are used if the device is restarted. |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) show install committed  Example: ``` switch# show install committed  ``` | (Optional)  Displays which packages are committed. |

### Deactivating and Removing Packages

When a package is deactivated, it is no longer active on the device,
but the package files remain on the boot disk. The package files can be
reactivated later, or they can be removed from the disk.

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to deactivate and remove RPM package files. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Erasing an RPM" section of the [Cisco Nexus 3000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/programmability/7_x/b_Cisco_Nexus_3000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | install deactivate filename  Example: ``` switch# install deactivate nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm ``` | Deactivates a package that was added to the device and turns off the package features for the line card.   | **Note** | Press **?** after a partial package name to display all possible matches available for deactivation. If there is only one match, press the **Tab** key to fill in the rest of the package name. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) show install inactive  Example: ``` switch# show install inactive  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the inactive packages on the device. |
| **Step 3** | (Optional) install commit  Example: ``` switch# install commit  ``` | (Optional)  Commits the current set of packages so that these packages are used if the device is restarted.   | **Note** | Packages can be removed only if the deactivation operation is committed. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) install remove {filename | inactive}  Example: ``` switch# install remove nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm Proceed with removing nxos.CSCab00001_TOR-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2a.lib32_n9000.rpm? (y/n)? [n] y  ```  Example: ``` switch# install remove inactive Proceed with removing? (y/n)? [n] y  ``` | (Optional)  Removes the inactive package.   * Only inactive packages   can be removed. * Packages can be   removed only if they are deactivated from all line cards in the device. * The package   deactivation must be committed. * To remove a specific   inactive package from a storage device, use the   install remove command with the   filename argument. * To remove all inactive   packages from all nodes in the system, use the   install remove command with the   inactive keyword. |

### Downgrading Feature RPMs

Follow this procedure to downgrade an installed feature RPM to the base feature RPM.

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to downgrade feature RPMs. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Downgrading an RPM" section of the [Cisco Nexus 3000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus3000/sw/programmability/7_x/b_Cisco_Nexus_3000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | (Optional) show install packages  Example: ``` switch# show install packages ntp.lib32_n9000     1.0.1-7.0.3.I2.2e      installed    ``` | (Optional)  Displays the feature RPM packages on the device. |
| **Step 2** | run bash  Example: ``` switch# run bash bash-4.2$ ``` | Loads Bash. |
| **Step 3** | ls \*feature\*  Example: ``` bash-4.2$ ls *ntp* ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm ``` | Lists the RPM for the specified feature. |
| **Step 4** | cp filename /bootflash  Example: ``` bash-4.2$ cp ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm /bootflash ``` | Copies the base feature RPM to the bootflash. |
| **Step 5** | exit  Example: ``` bash-4.2$ exit ``` | Exits Bash. |
| **Step 6** | install add bootflash:filename activate downgrade  Example: ``` switch# install add bootflash:ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm activate downgrade Adding the patch (/ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm) [#############       ]  60% Adding the patch (/ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm) [####################] 100% Install operation 11 completed successfully at Thu Sep  8 15:35:35 2015  Activating the patch (/ntp-1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e.lib32_n9000.rpm) This install operation requires system reload.

A reload is required only when downgrading the NTP and SNMP feature RPMs. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 7** | (Optional) show install packages | i feature  Example: ``` switch# show install packages | i ntp ntp.lib32_n9000    1.0.0-7.0.3.I2.2e   installed     ``` | (Optional)  Displays the base feature RPM on the device. |

### Displaying Installation Log Information

The installation log provides information on the history of the
installation operations. Each time an installation operation is run, a number
is assigned to that operation.

* Use the
  show install log command to display information
  about both successful and failed installation operations.
* Use the
  show install log command with no arguments to
  display a summary of all installation operations. Specify the
  request-id argument to display information
  specific to an operation. Use the
  detail keyword to display details for a specific
  operation, including file changes, nodes that could not be reloaded, and any
  impact to processes.

This example shows how to display information for all installation
requests:

```

"text": "A vulnerability in the Unidirectional Link Detection (UDLD) feature of Cisco FXOS Software and Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges or cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device.\r\n\r\nThis vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco UDLD protocol packets to a directly connected, affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges or cause the Cisco UDLD process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nNote: The UDLD feature is disabled by default, and the conditions to exploit this vulnerability are strict. The attacker needs full control of a directly connected device. That device must be connected over a port channel that has UDLD enabled. To trigger arbitrary code execution, both the UDLD-enabled port channel and specific system conditions must exist. In the absence of either the UDLD-enabled port channel or the system conditions, attempts to exploit this vulnerability will result in a DoS condition.\r\n\r\nIt is possible, but highly unlikely, that an attacker could control the necessary conditions for exploitation. The CVSS score reflects this possibility. However, given the complexity of exploitation, Cisco has assigned a Medium Security Impact Rating (SIR) to this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n"

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Minimum Recommended Cisco NX-OS Releases for Cisco Nexus 5600 Series Switches ---

 **Date: February 13, 2023**

This document lists the minimum recommended Cisco NX-OS software release for use with Cisco Nexus 5600 Series switches for both new deployments and existing deployments. Since these are minimum release recommendations, more recent software releases can be used to take advantage of newer hardware and software capabilities. These recommendations are general and should not replace environment specific design review efforts.

 **General Recommendation for New Deployments**

Cisco recommends that customers with new Cisco Nexus 5600 Series deployments choose from the following minimum recommended releases:

Table 1 Cisco Nexus 5600 Recommended Releases

| Platform Series/Product Name | Minimum Recommended Release | Recommended Release |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Nexus 5624Q Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |
| Cisco Nexus 5648Q Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |
| Cisco Nexus 5696Q Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |
| Cisco Nexus 56128P Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |
| Cisco Nexus 5672UP Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |
| Cisco Nexus 5672-16G Switch | NX-OS 7.3(8)N1(1) | NX-OS 7.3(13)N1(1) |

 **Existing Deployments That Use Software Earlier Than One of the Recommended Releases**

To the extent possible, Cisco recommends upgrading to one of the NX-OS releases listed previously. If that is not possible, Cisco recommends that you review the  [Cisco NX-OS Release Notes](//www.cisco.com/en/US/products/ps9670/prod_release_notes_list.html)  for the earlier release and the Bug Tool Kit to determine the impact of any open caveats.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco UDLD protocol packets to a directly connected, affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges or cause the Cisco UDLD process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.  **Note:** *The UDLD feature is disabled by default,* and the conditions to exploit this vulnerability are strict. The attacker needs full control of a directly connected device. That device must be connected over a port channel that has UDLD enabled. To trigger arbitrary code execution, both the UDLD-enabled port channel and specific system conditions must exist. In the absence of either the UDLD-enabled port channel or the system conditions, attempts to exploit this vulnerability will result in a DoS condition.  It is possible, but highly unlikely, that an attacker could control the necessary conditions for exploitation. The CVSS score reflects this possibility. However, given the complexity of exploitation, Cisco has assigned a Medium Security Impact Rating (SIR) to this vulnerability.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.

Firepower 4100/9300 products do *not* officially support UDLD; however, the CLI includes commands to enable it. These products could be vulnerable only if UDLD has been enabled in error. In such cases, administrators are advised to disable UDLD to fully eliminate exposure to this vulnerability.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the Status of the UDLD Feature on Affected Devices Devices that are running a vulnerable software release and have the UDLD feature enabled are affected by this vulnerability. The following subsections provide details about how to determine whether the UDLD feature is enabled.  **Cisco FXOS Software and UCS Fabric Interconnects**  To determine whether the UDLD feature is enabled on a device, use the **scope org** command followed by the **show udld-link-policy** commands at the device CLI. The command output will display either *Enabled* or *Disabled* under *Admin State* for the default and for any manually configured UDLD link policy. The following example shows the command output on a device that has UDLD disabled:  ```   fxos# scope orgfxos# show udld-link-policyUDLD link policy:Name       Admin State UDLD mode---------- ----------- ---------default       Disabled    Normal   ```  **Cisco NX-OS Software**  To determine whether the UDLD feature is enabled on a device, use the **show running-config | include "feature udld"** command at the device CLI. If the command returns output, the *udld* feature is configured on the device. The following example shows the command output on a device that has UDLD enabled:  ```   nxos# show running-config | include "feature udld"feature udld   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco FXOS Software At the time of publication, the release information in the following table(s) was accurate. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.  The left column lists Cisco software releases, and the right column indicates whether a release was affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and which release included the fix for this vulnerability.  **Firepower 4100 Series and Firepower 9300 Security Appliances**       | Cisco FXOS Software Release | First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability |   | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 2.8 | Migrate to a fixed release.1 |   | 2.8 | 2.8.1.1431 |   | 2.9 | 2.9.1.1351 |      1. Firepower 4100/9300 products do *not* officially support UDLD; however, the CLI includes commands to enable it. These products could be vulnerable only if UDLD has been enabled in error. In such cases, administrators are advised to disable UDLD to fully eliminate exposure to this vulnerability.Cisco NX-OS Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco NX-OS Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific Cisco NX-OS Software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities that are described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software, platform, and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories or one or more specific advisories.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Finding Feature Information

Your software release
may not support all the features documented in this module. For the latest
caveats and feature information, see
[Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/search?null) and the release notes for your platform
and software release. To find information about the features documented in this
module, and to see a list of the releases in which each feature is supported,
see the feature information table at the end of this module.

Use Cisco Feature
Navigator to find information about platform support and Cisco software image
support. To access Cisco Feature Navigator, go to
[www.cisco.com/​go/​cfn](www.cisco.com/go/cfn). An account on Cisco.com is not
required.

## Prerequisites for SMUs

These prerequisites
must be met for a package to be activated or deactivated:

* You must be in a
  user group associated with a task group that includes the proper task IDs. If
  you suspect a user group assignment is preventing you from using a command,
  contact your AAA administrator for assistance.
* Verify that all
  line cards are installed and operating properly. For example, do not activate
  or deactivate packages while line cards are booting, while line cards are being
  upgraded or replaced, or when you anticipate an automatic switchover activity.
* In a dual-supervisor system, both the active and standby supervisor
  modules have to be synchronized with each other.

## Guidelines and Limitations for SMUs

SMUs have the
following guidelines and limitations:

* Some packages
  require the activation or deactivation of other packages. If the SMUs have
  dependencies on each other, you cannot activate them without first activating
  the previous ones.
* The package being
  activated must be compatible with the current active software set.
* You cannot
  activate multiple SMUs in one command.
* Per-VDC SMUs are not supported.
* Activation is
  performed only after the package compatibility checks have been passed. If a
  conflict is found, an error message displays.
* While a software
  package is being activated, other requests are not allowed to run on any of the
  impacted nodes. Package activation is completed when a message similar to this
  one appears:

  ```
  Install operation 1 completed successfully at Thu Jan 9 01:19:24 2014
  ```
* Each CLI install
  request is assigned a request ID, which can be used later to review the events.
* SMUs are dependent on your physical device. So, an SMU for the Cisco
  Nexus 7000 Series will not work for the Cisco Nexus 7700 Series and vice versa.
* If you perform a
  software maintenance upgrade and later upgrade your device to a new Cisco NX-OS
  software release, the new image will overwrite both the previous Cisco NX-OS
  release and the SMU package file.
* SMUs are dependent on the version of Cisco NX-OS software release
  installed. You need to install SMUs compatible with your release. Moving to
  another Cisco NX-OS software release using reload or ISSU will inactivate the
  SMUs installed for the previously installed Cisco NX-OS software release. For
  example, if you have SMUs for Cisco NX-OS Release 7.2.0 in your Supervisor 2
  setup, moving to an image of another release, say Cisco NX-OS Release 7.2.2
  will cause the SMU to become inactive.
* SMU will be deactivated if you are loading an image of the Cisco
  NX-OS software release prior to NX-OS Release 7.2.0 that does not support SMUs.
  However, moving back to Cisco NX-OS Release 7.2.0 will activate the SMU.

### Overview of SMUs

Typically, SMUs do
not have a large impact on device operations. SMU versions are synchronized to
the package major, minor, and maintenance versions they upgrade.

SMUs are not an alternative to maintenance releases. They provide a
quick resolution of immediate issues. All defects fixed by SMUs are integrated
into the maintenance releases.

Actual deployment of SMUs might vary based on your device. Usually,
software can be patched simply by restarting the process. However, based on the
device, if the process to be patched cannot be restarted, the SMU is
implemented either through a reload or ISSU.

The effect of an SMU
depends on its type:

* Process restart
  SMU—Causes a process or group of processes to restart on activation.
* Reload SMU—Causes
  a reload of the whole switch and a parallel reload of supervisors and line
  cards.
* Line card
  SMU—Based on the line card type. The supervisor pushes the SMU to all impacted
  line cards. Activation of the line card SMU requires a reload of the switch.
* ISSU SMU—Deployed
  using ISSU orchestration.
* Prerequisite
  SMU—Requires activation before a dependent SMU is loaded. A SMU can have one or
  more SMU as prerequisites.
* Supersede SMU—
  Contains cumulative fix for previously loaded SMUs and supersedes the former.

For information on upgrading your device to a new feature or maintenance
release, see the
*Cisco Nexus 7000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade and Downgrade
Guide*.

A SMU consists of the SMU binary file and an accompanying README.txt
which contains any associated caveats. The naming convention for an SMU is as
below:

*<platform>-<pkg-type>.<release\_version>.<CDET>.<file-type>*

For example:

n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin

n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.txt

### Package Management

The general procedure
for adding and activating SMU packages on the device is as follows:

1. Copy the package file or
   files to a local storage device or file server.
2. Add the package or packages
   on the device using the
   install
   add command.
3. Activate the package or
   packages on the device using the
   install
   activate command.
4. Commit the current set of
   packages using the
   install
   commit command. However, in case of the reload or ISSU SMU, commit
   the packages after the reload or ISSU.
5. (Optional) Deactivate and
   remove the package, when desired.

The following figure
illustrates the key steps in the package management process.

Figure 1. Process to Add,
Activate, and Commit SMU Packages

### Impact of Package Activation and Deactivation

The activation or
deactivation of an SMU package can have an immediate impact on the system. The
system can be affected in the following ways:

* New processes
  might be started.
* Running processes
  might be stopped or restarted.
* All processes on
  the line cards can be patched and only those processes that can be restarted
  are restarted. Restarting processes in the line cards are equivalent to a soft
  reset.
* For line card SMUs, the system behaves as if it were going through
  an upgrade.
* The line cards
  might reload.
* The complete system might reload.
* No processes in
  the line cards might be affected.

| **Note** | ---  You must address any issues that result from the revised configuration and reapply the configuration, if necessary.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Tip** | ---  When you activate packages, use the test option to test the effects of a command without impacting the running system. After the activation process completes, enter the show install log command to display the process results.  --- |

### Preparing for Package Installation

You should use
several
show commands to gather information in preparation for
the SMU package installation.

**Before You Begin**

Determine if a
software change is required.

Verify that the new
package is supported on your system. Some software packages require that other
packages or package versions be activated, and some packages support only
specific line cards.

Review the release
notes for important information related to that release and to help determine
the package compatibility with your device configuration.

Verify that the
system is stable and prepared for the software changes.

**Procedure**

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |

| **Step 1** | show install active  **Example:** ``` switch# show install active ``` | Displays the active software on the device. Use this command to determine what software should be added on the device. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | show module  **Example:** ``` switch# show module ``` | Confirms that all modules are in the stable state. |
| **Step 3** | show clock  **Example:** ``` switch# show clock ``` | Verifies that the system clock is correct. Software operations use certificates based on device clock times. |
| **Step 4** | show install pkg-info *SMU\_name*  **Example:** ``` Device# show install pkg-info n7700-s2- dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin ``` | Displays details regarding the contents of the SMU, that is, SMU restart type, platform, processes affected, and so on. |

This example shows
how to display the active packages for the entire system. Use this information
to determine if a software change is required.

Before SMU
installation:

```
switch# show install active

Boot Images:

Kickstart Image: bootflash:/ n7700-s2-kickstart.7.2.0.D1.1.bin

### Copying the Package File to a Local Storage Device or Network Server

You must copy the
SMU package file to a local storage device or a network file server to which
the device has access. After this task is done, the package can be added and
activated on the device.

If you need to store
package files on the device, we recommend that you store the files on the hard
disk. The boot device is the local disk from which the package is added and
activated. The default boot device is bootflash:.

| **Tip** | ---  Before you copy package files to a local storage device, use the dir command to determine if the required package files are already on the device.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Tip** | ---  Verify there is enough space on the bootflash.  --- |
| --- | --- |

If the SMU package
files are located on a remote TFTP, FTP, SCP, or SFTP server, you can copy the
files to a local storage device. After the files are located on the local
storage device, the package can be added and activated on the device from that
storage device. The following server protocols are supported:

* Trivial File
  Transfer Protocol—TFTP allows files to be transferred from one computer to
  another over a network, usually without the use of client authentication (for
  example, username and password). It is a simplified version of FTP.

  | **Note** | ---  Some package files might be larger than 32 MB, and the TFTP services provided by some vendors might not support a file this large. If you do not have access to a TFTP server that supports files larger than 32 MB, download the file using FTP.  --- |
  | --- | --- |
* File Transfer
  Protocol—FTP is part of the TCP/IP protocol stack and requires a username and
  password.
* Secure Copy—SCP allows files to be transferred from a network
  server that supports Secure Shell (SSH) and uses the secure copy protocol(SCP).
* SSH File
  Transfer Protocol—SFTP is part of the SSHv2 feature in the security package and
  provides for secure file transfers. For more information, see the
  Cisco Nexus
  7000 Series NX-OS Security Configuration Guide.

| **Note** | ---  Consult your system administrator for the location and availability of your network server.  --- |
| --- | --- |

Use the commands in
the following table to copy the SMU package file from the server to your device
using the file transfer protocols.

Table 1 Commands for
Copying SMU Package Files to the Device
| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| copy tftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename bootflash:  ``` switch# copy tftp://10.1.1.1/images/ n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin bootflash:  ``` | Copies the package file from the TFTP server to the bootflash:.   * hostname-or-ipaddress—The hostname or IP address of   the network file server. * directory-path—The   network file server path that leads to the package file to be added. * filename—The name   of the package file that you want to add. |
| copy ftp://username:password@hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename bootflash:  ``` switch# copy ftp://john:secret@10.1.1.1/images/ n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin bootflash:   ``` | Copies the package file from the FTP server to the bootflash:.   * username—The   username of the user who has access privileges to the directory in which the   package file is stored. * password—The   password associated with the username of the user who has access privileges to   the directory in which the package file is stored. If a password is not   provided, the networking device accepts anonymous FTP. * hostname-or-ipaddress—The hostname or IP address of   the network file server. * directory-path—The   network file server path that leads to the package file to be added. The   specified directory should be a directory under the home directory of the user.   In this example, the file being downloaded is in a subdirectory called "images"   in the home directory of the user "john."      | **Note** | For FTP services, directory-path is the directory relative to the username home directory. If you want to specify an absolute path for the directory, you must add a “/” following the server address. |   | --- | --- | * filename—The name   of the package file that you want to add. |
| copy sftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename bootflash:  ``` switch# copy sftp://10.1.1.1/images n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin  bootflash: ``` | Copies the package file from the SFTP server to the bootflash:.   * username—The username of the user who has   access privileges to the directory in which the package file is stored. * directory-path—The   network file server path that leads to the package file to be added. * filename—The name   of the package file that you want to add. |
| copy scp://username@scpserver.cisco.com//directory-path/filename bootflash:  ``` switch# copy  scp://john@10.1.1.1//download/n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin  bootflash:n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin ``` | Copies the package file from the SCP server to the bootflash:.   * hostname-or-ipaddress—The hostname or   IP address of the network file server. * directory-path—The network file server   path that leads to the package file to be added. * filename—The name of the package file   that you want to add. |

After the SMU
package file has been transferred to a network file server or the local storage
device, you are ready to add and activate the file.

### Adding and Activating Packages

You can add SMU
package files that are stored on a local storage device or on a remote TFTP,
FTP, or SFTP server to your device.

| **Note** | ---  The SMU package being activated must be compatible with the currently active software to operate. When activation is attempted, the system runs an automatic compatibility check to ensure that the package is compatible with the other active software on the device. If a conflict is found, an error message displays. The activation is performed only after all compatibility checks have been passed.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  Activating an SMU for a process does not deactivate SMUs applied for other processes. However, previously active SMUs for the same process will be deactivated.  --- |
| --- | --- |

**Before You Begin**

Make sure that all
packages to be added are present on a local storage device or a network file
server.

Make sure that you
meet all of the prerequisites for the activation of packages.

Complete the
procedure described in
[Copying the Package File to a Local Storage Device or Network Server](#task_B304847A8D5845F39DC283F481E64A02).

**Procedure**

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |

| **Step 1** | Connect to the console port and log in. | Establishes a CLI management session to the console port. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | dir bootflash: | (Optional) Displays the package files that are available to be added.   | **Note** | Only SMU package files can be added and activated using this procedure. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | install add filename [activate]  **Example:** ``` switch# install add bootflash: n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin  ``` | Unpacks the package software files from the local storage device or network server and adds them to the bootflash: on active and standby supervisors.  The filename argument can take any of these formats:   * bootflash:filename * tftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * ftp://username:password@   hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * sftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * usb1:filename   Multiple versions of an SMU package can be added to the storage device without impacting the currently running software, but only one version of a package can be activated. |
| **Step 4** | show install inactive  **Example:** ``` switch# show install inactive  ``` | (Optional) Displays the inactive packages on the device. Verify that the package added in the previous step appears in the display. |
| **Step 5** | install activate filename [test]  **Example:** ``` switch# install activate n7700-s2- dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin  Install operation 158 completed successfully at Tue Jun 9 19:09:33 2015   ``` | Activates a package that was added to the device. SMU packages remain inactive until activated. (Skip this step if the package was activated earlier with the install add activate command.)   | **Note** | Press **?** after a partial package name to display all possible matches available for activation. If there is only one match, press the **Tab** key to fill in the rest of the package name. | | --- | --- |  | **Tip** | When you activate packages, use the test keyword to test the effects of a command without impacting the running system. After the activation process finishes, enter the show install log command to display the process results. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 6** | Repeat Step 5 until all packages are activated. | Activates additional packages as required. |
| **Step 7** | show install active  **Example:** ``` switch# show install active  ``` | (Optional) Displays all active packages. Use this command to determine if the correct packages are active. |

### Committing the Active Package Set

When an SMU package
is activated on the device, it becomes part of the current running
configuration. To make the package activation persistent across system-wide
reloads, you must commit the package on the device.

For reload and ISSU SMU, you must commit the package after the switch
reload or the ISSU completion.

| **Note** | ---   On startup, the device loads the committed package set. If the system is reloaded before the current active package is committed, the previously committed package set is used.   --- |
| --- | --- |

**Before You Begin**

Before you commit a
package set, verify that the device is operating correctly and is forwarding
packets as expected.

Complete the
procedure described in
[Adding and Activating Packages](#task_77A6AAE7FD0F4B69896D8FDEDF65D633).

**Procedure**

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |

| **Step 1** | install commit filename  **Example:** ``` switch# install commit n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin  ``` | Commits the current set of packages so that these packages are used if the device is restarted. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | show install committed  **Example:** ``` switch# show install committed  ``` | (Optional) Displays which packages are committed. |

This example shows
how to commit active SMU packages on the device and then verify the committed
packages:

```
switch#  install commit n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin
Install operation 2 completed successfully at Thu Jan 9 01:20:46 2014

switch# show install committed
Boot Images:
      Kickstart Image: bootflash:/n7700-s2-kickstart.7.2.0.D1.1.bin
      System Image: bootflash:/ n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.bin

Committed Packages:
      n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin

```

### Deactivating and Removing Packages

When a package is
deactivated, it is no longer active on the device, but the package files remain
on the boot disk. The package files can be reactivated later, or they can be
removed from the disk.

The Cisco NX-OS
software also provides the flexibility to roll back the selected package set to
a previously saved package set. If you find that you prefer a previous package
set over the currently active package set, you can use the
install
deactivate and
install
commit commands to deactivate the current package and install active
and install commit commands to activate the previous package.

**Before You Begin**

You cannot
deactivate a package if it is required by another active package. When you
attempt to deactivate a package, the system runs an automatic check to ensure
that the package is not required by other active packages. The deactivation is
performed only after all compatibility checks have been passed.

You cannot delete a
package if it is part of the running or committed software of the device.

**Procedure**

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |

| **Step 1** | Connect to the console port and log in. | Establishes a CLI management session to the console port. |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | install deactivate filename  **Example:** ``` switch# install deactivate n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin  ``` | Deactivates a package that was added to the device and turns off the package features for the line card.   | **Note** | Press **?** after a partial package name to display all possible matches available for deactivation. If there is only one match, press the **Tab** key to fill in the rest of the package name. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | show install inactive  **Example:** ``` switch# show install inactive  ``` | (Optional) Displays the inactive packages on the device. |
| **Step 4** | install commit  **Example:** ``` switch# install commit  ``` | (Optional) Commits the current set of packages so that these packages are used if the device is restarted.   | **Note** | Packages can be removed only if the deactivation operation is committed. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 5** | install remove {filename | inactive}  **Example:** ``` switch# install remove n7700-s2- dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin Proceed with removing n7700-s2- dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin? (y/n)? [n] y   ``` **Example:** ``` switch# install remove inactive  Proceed with removing? (y/n)? [n] y  ``` | (Optional) Removes the inactive package.   * Only inactive packages can be   removed. * Packages can be removed only   if they are deactivated from all line cards in the device. * The package deactivation must   be committed. * To remove a specific inactive   package from a storage device, use the   install remove command with the   filename argument. * To remove all inactive   packages from all nodes in the system, use the   install remove command with the   inactive keyword. |

This example shows
how to deactivate a package, commit the changes, and remove the inactive
package from the device:

```
switch# install deactivate n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin
Install operation 3 completed successfully at Thu Jan 9 01:20:36 2014

switch# show install inactive
Inactive Packages: n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin

switch# install commit
Install operation 4 completed successfully at Thu Jan 9 01:20:46 2014

switch# install remove n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin
Proceed with removing n7700-s2-dk9.7.2.0.D1.1.CSCuo07721.bin? (y/n)? [n] y
Install operation 5 completed successfully at Thu Jan 9 01:20:57 2014
```

### Displaying Installation Log Information

The installation log
provides information on the history of the installation operations. Each time
an installation operation is run, a number is assigned to that operation.

* Use the
  show
  install log command to display information about both successful and
  failed installation operations.
* Use the
  show
  install log command with no arguments to display a summary of all
  installation operations. Specify the
  request-id argument to display information specific to
  an operation. Use the
  detail keyword to display details for a specific
  operation, including file changes, nodes that could not be reloaded, and any
  impact to processes.

This example shows how
to display information for all installation requests:

```
switch# show install log

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 8.8 |

## About SMUs

A software maintenance
upgrade (SMU) is a package file that contains fixes for a specific defect. SMUs
are created to respond to immediate issues and do not include new features.
Typically, SMUs do not have a large impact on device operations. SMU versions
are synchronized to the package major, minor, and maintenance versions they
upgrade.

The effect of an SMU
depends on its type:

* Process restart
  SMU-Causes a process or group of processes to restart on activation.
* Reload SMU-Causes
  a parallel reload of supervisors and line cards.

SMUs are not an alternative to maintenance releases. They provide a quick resolution of critical issues. All defects fixed
by SMUs are integrated into the next maintenance releases of upcoming software trains, as applicable. SMUs also have the following
considerations:

* SMUs are created for the following:

  + Critical SIR PSIRTs without a workaround or fix
  + Severity1 and Severity2 issues without a workaround or fix
* If a fix is already available in a maintenance release of the same software train or already released on a later long-lived
  release, no SMU is provided. You are encouraged to acquire the fix from the maintenance release.

  | **Note** | ---   Depending on the fix, in some cases it may not be possible to provide an SMU. In such cases, the only option is to upgrade to the next maintenance release when available.   --- |
  | --- | --- |

For information on
upgrading your device to a new feature or maintenance release, see the
[Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Software Upgrade
and Downgrade Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/upgrade/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Software_Upgrade_and_Downgrade_Guide_Release_7x.html).

| **Note** | ---  Activating an SMU does not cause any earlier SMUs, or the package to which the SMU applies, to be automatically deactivated.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I2(1), SMU package files have an .rpm extension. Earlier files have a .bin extension.   --- |

* [Impact of Package Activation and Deactivation](#concept_BF7F175B8B08473CA378A12F1D05BE41)

### Package Management

The general procedure
for adding and activating SMU packages on the device is as follows:

1. Copy the package file or files to a local storage device or file server.
2. Add the package or packages on the device using the install add command.
3. Activate the package or packages on the device using the install activate command.
4. Commit the current set of packages using the install commit command.
5. (Optional) Deactivate and remove the package.

The following figure
illustrates the key steps in the package management process.

Figure 1. Process to Add,
Activate, and Commit SMU Packages

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/500001-600000/500001-510000/503001-504000/503009.jpg)

### Impact of Package Activation and Deactivation

The activation or
deactivation of an SMU package can have an immediate impact on the system. The
system can be affected in the following ways:

* New processes
  might be started.
* Running processes
  might be stopped or restarted.
* All processes in
  the line cards might be restarted. Restarting processes in the line cards is
  equivalent to a soft reset.
* The line cards
  might reload.
* No processes in
  the line cards might be affected.

| **Note** | ---  You must address any issues that result from the revised configuration and reapply the configuration, if necessary.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Tip** | ---  After the activation process completes, enter the show install log command to display the process results.  --- |
| --- | --- |

## Prerequisites for SMUs

These prerequisites
must be met for a package to be activated or deactivated:

* You must be in a
  user group associated with a task group that includes the proper task IDs. If
  you suspect a user group assignment is preventing you from using a command,
  contact your AAA administrator for assistance.
* Verify that all
  line cards are installed and operating properly. For example, do not activate
  or deactivate packages while line cards are booting, while line cards are being
  upgraded or replaced, or when you anticipate an automatic switchover activity.

## Guidelines and Limitations for SMUs

SMUs have the
following guidelines and limitations:

* Some packages
  require the activation or deactivation of other packages. If the SMUs have
  dependencies on each other, you cannot activate them without first activating
  the previous ones.
* The package being
  activated must be compatible with the current active software set.
* Activation is
  performed only after the package compatibility checks have been passed. If a
  conflict is found, an error message displays.
* You can activate or deactivate multiple SMUs with a tarball SMU.
* While a software
  package is being activated, other requests are not allowed to run on any of the
  impacted nodes. Package activation is completed when a message similar to this
  one appears:

  ```
  Install operation 1 completed successfully at Thu Jan 9 01:19:24 2014
  ```
* Each CLI install
  request is assigned a request ID, which can be used later to review the events.
* If you perform a
  software maintenance upgrade and later upgrade your device to a new Cisco NX-OS
  software release, the new image will overwrite both the previous Cisco NX-OS
  release and the SMU package file.
* Beginning with Cisco NX-OS Release 7.0(3)I5(1), the SMU package file is named `nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm`, which support both n9k\_EOR and n9k\_TOR platforms.
* For the "Unable to remove MAC ACE using sequence number in 7.0(3)I7(2)" issue, if you are going to apply the patch that resolves
  it, you must make sure that the ACL is deleted before applying the patch. Otherwise, the issue will be seen again. This issue
  applies only to the ACL which has the redirect keyword in it.

### Preparing for Package Installation

You should use
several
show commands to gather information in preparation for
the SMU package installation.

#### Before you begin

Determine if a
software change is required.

Verify that the new
package is supported on your system. Some software packages require that other
packages or package versions be activated, and some packages support only
specific line cards.

Review the release
notes for important information related to that release and to help determine
the package compatibility with your device configuration.

Verify that the system is up, stable, and prepared for the software changes.

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | show logging logfile | grep -i "System ready"  Example: ``` switch# show logging logfile | grep -i "System ready" ``` | Displays if your system is up. Use this command to verify that the system is ready for SMU package installation. Configuring install commands before the system is ready, may result with an "Install operation 11 failed because cannot lock config" error message. |
| **Step 2** | show install active  Example: ``` switch# show install active ``` | Displays the active software on the device. Use this command to determine what software should be added on the device and to compare to the active software report after installation operations are complete. |
| **Step 3** | show module  Example: ``` switch# show module ``` | Confirms that all modules are in the stable state. |
| **Step 4** | show clock  Example: ``` switch# show clock ``` | Verifies that the system clock is correct. Software operations use certificates based on device clock times. |

#### Example

This example shows how to verify that the system is up. A "System ready" response indicates that the system is ready for SMU
package installation.
```
switch# show logging logfile | grep -i "System ready"
2018 Feb 19 11:13:04 switch %ASCII-CFG-2-CONF_CONTROL: System ready

```

This example shows
how to display the active packages for the entire system. Use this information
to determine if a software change is required.

```
switch# show install active
Boot Image:
        NXOS Image: bootflash:///nxos.7.0.3.I7.3.1.bin

Active Packages:

switch#

```

This example shows
how to display the current system clock setting:

```
switch# show clock
02:14:51.474 PST Wed Jan 04 2014

```

### Downloading the SMU Package File from Cisco.com

Follow these steps
to download the SMU package file:

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Log in to Cisco.com. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Go to the Download Software page at this URL: <http://software.cisco.com/download/navigator.html> |
| **Step 3** | In the Select a Product list, choose **Switches** > **Data Center Switches** > **Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Switches** > model. |
| **Step 4** | Choose the appropriate SMU file for your device and click **Download**. |

### Copying the Package File to a Local Storage Device or Network Server

You must copy the
SMU package file to a local storage device or a network file server to which
the device has access. After this task is done, the package can be added and
activated on the device.

If you need to store
package files on the device, we recommend that you store the files on the hard
disk. The boot device is the local disk from which the package is added and
activated. The default boot device is bootflash:.

| **Tip** | ---  Before you copy package files to a local storage device, use the dir command to determine if the required package files are already on the device.  --- |
| --- | --- |

If the SMU package
files are located on a remote TFTP, FTP, or SFTP server, you can copy the files
to a local storage device. After the files are located on the local storage
device, the package can be added and activated on the device from that storage
device. The following server protocols are supported:

* Trivial File
  Transfer Protocol—TFTP allows files to be transferred from one computer to
  another over a network, usually without the use of client authentication (for
  example, username and password). It is a simplified version of FTP.

  | **Note** | ---  Some package files might be larger than 32 MB, and the TFTP services provided by some vendors might not support a file this large. If you do not have access to a TFTP server that supports files larger than 32 MB, download the file using FTP.  --- |
  | --- | --- |
* File Transfer
  Protocol—FTP is part of the TCP/IP protocol stack and requires a username and
  password.
* SSH File
  Transfer Protocol—SFTP is part of the SSHv2 feature in the security package and
  provides for secure file transfers. For more information, see the
  [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Security
  Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/security/configuration/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Security_Configuration_Guide_7x.html).

| **Note** | ---  Consult your system administrator for the location and availability of your network server.  --- |
| --- | --- |

Use the commands in
the following table to copy the SMU package file from the server to your device
using the file transfer protocols.

Table 1. Commands for
Copying SMU Package Files to the Device

| Command | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| copy tftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename bootflash:  ``` switch# copy tftp://10.1.1.1/images/ nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm bootflash:  ``` | Copies the package file from the TFTP server to the bootflash:.   * hostname-or-ipaddress—The hostname or IP address of   the network file server. * directory-path—The   network file server path that leads to the package file to be added. * filename—The name   of the package file that you want to add. |
| copy ftp://username:password@hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename bootflash:  ``` switch# copy ftp://john:secret@10.1.1.1/images/ nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm bootflash:  ``` | Copies the package file from the FTP server to the bootflash:.   * username—The   username of the user who has access privileges to the directory in which the   package file is stored. * password—The   password associated with the username of the user who has access privileges to   the directory in which the package file is stored. If a password is not   provided, the networking device accepts anonymous FTP. * hostname-or-ipaddress—The hostname or IP address of   the network file server. * directory-path—The   network file server path that leads to the package file to be added. The   specified directory should be a directory under the home directory of the user.   In this example, the file being downloaded is in a subdirectory called "images"   in the home directory of the user "john."      | **Note** | For FTP services, directory-path is the directory relative to the username home directory. If you want to specify an absolute path for the directory, you must add a “/” following the server address. |   | --- | --- | * filename—The name   of the package file that you want to add. |
| copy sftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename bootflash:  ``` switch# copy sftp://10.1.1.1/images/nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL- 1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm bootflash: ``` | Copies the package file from the SFTP server to the bootflash:.   * hostname-or-ipaddress—The hostname or IP address of   the network file server. * directory-path—The network file server path that leads   to the package file to be added. * filename—The name of the package file that you want to   add. |

After the SMU
package file has been transferred to a network file server or the local storage
device, you are ready to add and activate the file.

### Adding and Activating Packages

You can add SMU package files that are stored on a local storage device or on a remote TFTP, FTP, or SFTP server to your device.

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to add and activate RPM package files. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Installing RPMs from Bash" section of the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  The SMU package being activated must be compatible with the currently active software to operate. When an activation is attempted, the system runs an automatic compatibility check to ensure that the package is compatible with the other active software on the device. If a conflict is found, an error message displays. The activation is performed only after all compatibility checks have been passed.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  Activating an SMU does not cause any earlier SMUs or the package to which the SMU applies to be automatically deactivated.  --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Make sure that all
packages to be added are present on a local storage device or a network file
server.

Make sure that you
meet all of the prerequisites for the activation of packages.

Complete the
procedure described in
[Copying the Package File to a Local Storage Device or Network Server](#task_B304847A8D5845F39DC283F481E64A02).

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | Connect to the console port and log in. | Establishes a CLI management session to the console port. |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) dir bootflash: | (Optional)  Displays the package files that are available to be added.   | **Note** | Only SMU package files can be added and activated using this procedure. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 3** | install add filename [activate]  Example: ``` switch# install add bootflash: nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1. lib32_n9000.rpm  ``` | Unpacks the package software files from the local storage device or network server and adds them to the bootflash: and all active and standby supervisors installed on the device.  The filename argument can take any of these formats:   * bootflash:filename * tftp://hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * ftp://username:password@    hostname-or-ipaddress/directory-path/filename * usb1:filename * usb2:filename   For all SMU packages except the CSCur02700 SMU package, you can use the optional activate  keyword to automatically activate the package after it is added successfully.   | **Note** | For the CSCur02700 SMU package, use the install activate command in Step 5 to activate the package. Do not use the optional activate keyword with the install add command as the package might fail and require a reboot. | | --- | --- |   Multiple versions of an SMU package can be added to the storage device without impacting the running configuration, but only one version of a package can be activated for a line card.   | **Note** | Press **?** after a partial package name to display all possible matches available for activation. If there is only one match, press the **Tab** key to fill in the rest of the package name. | | --- | --- |   You can use the install add command with a tarball SMU to install multiple SMUs at the same time. |
| **Step 4** | (Optional) show install inactive  Example: ``` switch# show install inactive  ``` | (Optional)  Displays the inactive packages on the device. Verify that the package added in the previous step appears in the display. |
| **Step 5** | install activate filename  Example: ``` switch# install activate nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1. lib32_n9000.rpm  ```  Example: ``` switch# install activate nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1. lib32_n9000.rpm Install operation 18 !!WARNING!! This patch will get activated only after a reload of the switch. at Wed Jun 22 00:42:12 2016  ``` | Activates a package that was added to the device. SMU packages remain inactive until activated. (Skip this step if the package was activated earlier with the install add activate command.)   | **Tip** | After the activation process finishes, enter the show install log command to display the process results. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 6** | Repeat Step 5 until all packages are activated. | Activates additional packages as required. |
| **Step 7** | (Optional) show install active  Example: ``` switch# show install active  ``` | (Optional)  Displays all active packages. Use this command to determine if the correct packages are active. |

#### Example

This example shows how to add multiple SMU package files with a tarball and then verify the added package files.
```
switch# install add bootflash:nxos.CSC123456-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I7.3.
lib32_n9000.tar
[####################] 100%
Install operation 882 completed successfully at Tue Mar  6 17:30:31 2018

switch#
switch# show install inactive
Boot Image:
        NXOS Image: bootflash:////nxos.7.0.3.I7.3.bin-219-CCO

Inactive Packages:
        nxos.CSC123456_core-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I7.3.lib32_n9000

Inactive Base Packages:

switch#

```

### Committing the Active Package Set

When an SMU package
is activated on the device, it becomes part of the current running
configuration. To make the package activation persistent across system-wide
reloads, you must commit the package on the device.

| **Note** | ---   On startup, the device loads the committed package set. If the system is reloaded before the current active package is committed, the previously committed package set is used.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

Before you commit a
package set, verify that the device is operating correctly and is forwarding
packets as expected.

Complete the
procedure described in
[Adding and Activating Packages](#task_77A6AAE7FD0F4B69896D8FDEDF65D633).

#### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | install commit filename  Example: ``` switch# install commit nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm  ``` | Commits the current set of packages so that these packages are used if the device is restarted. |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) show install committed  Example: ``` switch# show install committed  ``` | (Optional)  Displays which packages are committed. |

#### Example

This example shows
how to commit active SMU packages on the device and then verify the committed
packages:

```
switch# install commit nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm
Install operation 2 completed successfully at Wed Jun 22 01:20:46 2016

switch# show install committed
Committed Packages:
nxos.CSCab00001-n9k_ALL-1.0.0-7.0.3.I5.1.lib32_n9000.rpm
```

### Deactivating and Removing Packages

When a package is
deactivated, it is no longer active on the device, but the package files remain
on the boot disk. The package files can be reactivated later, or they can be
removed from the disk.

The Cisco NX-OS
software also provides the flexibility to roll back the selected package set to
a previously saved package set. If you find that you prefer a previous package
set over the currently active package set, you can use the
install
deactivate and
install
commit commands to make a previously active package set active again.

| **Note** | ---   This procedure uses Cisco NX-OS CLI commands to deactivate and remove RPM package files. If you would prefer to use YUM commands, follow the instructions in the "Erasing an RPM" section of the [Cisco Nexus 9000 Series NX-OS Programmability Guide](http://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/datacenter/nexus9000/sw/7-x/programmability/guide/b_Cisco_Nexus_9000_Series_NX-OS_Programmability_Guide_7x/Bash.html).   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Before you begin

You cannot
deactivate a package if it is required by another active package. When you
attempt to deactivate a package, the system runs an automatic check to ensure
that the package is not required by other active packages. The deactivation is
performed only after all compatibility checks have been passed.

You cannot delete a
package if it is part of the running or committed software of the device.

### Displaying Installation Log Information

The installation log
provides information on the history of the installation operations. Each time
an installation operation is run, a number is assigned to that operation.

* Use the
  show
  install log command to display information about both successful and
  failed installation operations.
* Use the
  show
  install log command with no arguments to display a summary of all
  installation operations. Specify the
  request-id argument to display information specific to
  an operation. Use the
  detail keyword to display details for a specific
  operation, including file changes, nodes that could not be reloaded, and any
  impact to processes.

This example shows how
to display information for all installation requests:

## Performing a Software Maintenance Upgrade for Guest Shell Bash

You can perform a
software maintenance upgrade for Bash in the Guest Shell.

### Procedure

|  | Command or Action | Purpose |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Step 1** | Download the SMU package file for Guest Shell Bash from Cisco.com. | Obtains the package file from Cisco.com. For instructions, see [Downloading the SMU Package File from Cisco.com](#task_5AB2793ED8F742AFA53CC493CE12AB77). |
| **Step 2** | Copy the SMU package file to the bootflash: of the switch. | Copies the package file to the device. For instructions, see [Copying the Package File to a Local Storage Device or Network Server](#task_B304847A8D5845F39DC283F481E64A02). |
| **Step 3** | guestshell  Example: ``` switch# guestshell guestshell:~$  ``` | Accesses the Guest Shell. |
| **Step 4** | sudo rpm -Uvh /bootflash/filename  Example: ``` guestshell:~$ sudo rpm -Uvh /bootflash/bash-4.2-r8.x86_64.rpm Preparing...                ########################################### [100%]    1:bash                   ########################################### [100%] update-alternatives: Linking //bin/sh to /bin/bash  ``` | Upgrades the existing Bash file in the Guest Shell. |
| **Step 5** | rpm -qa | grep bash  Example: ``` guestshell:~$ rpm -qa | grep bash bash-4.2-r8.x86_64  ``` | Verifies that the new version of the Bash file was installed successfully. |
| **Step 6** | guestshell sync  Example: ``` switch# guestshell sync Access to the guest shell will be temporarily disabled while it synchronizes contents to standby. Are you sure you want to continue? (y/n) [n] y dt-n9k3-1# 2014 Oct  7 05:00:01 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-INSTALL_STATE: Deactivating virtual service 'guestshell+' dt-n9k3-1# 2014 Oct  7 05:00:06 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-ACTIVATION_STATE: Successfully deactivated virtual service 'guestshell+'  2014 Oct  7 05:00:12 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-ACTIVATION_STATE: Successfully deactivated virtual service 'guestshell+' ; Starting sync to standby sup 2014 Oct  7 05:00:32 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-MOVE_STATE: Successfully synced virtual service 'guestshell+' ; Activating 2014 Oct  7 05:00:32 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-ACTIVATION_STATE: Activating virtual service 'guestshell+'  2014 Oct  7 05:00:56 dt-n9k3-1 %$ VDC-1 %$ %VMAN-2-ACTIVATION_STATE: Successfully activated virtual service 'guestshell+'  ``` | On a dual-supervisor system, synchronizes the rootfs with the Bash SMU version to the standby supervisor before doing a switchover. If you do not run this command, you will need to repeat this procedure after a supervisor switchover.   | **Note** | The new Bash file is preserved after a Guest Shell reboot or Guest Shell disable+enable. However, you need to reinstall the Guest Shell Bash SMU package file after a Guest Shell destroy+enable. | | --- | --- | |

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. [Learn more](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/social-justice/inclusive-language-policy.html) about how Cisco is using Inclusive Language.

This vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted Cisco UDLD protocol packets to a directly connected, affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code with administrative privileges or cause the Cisco UDLD process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.  **Note:** *The UDLD feature is disabled by default,* and the conditions to exploit this vulnerability are strict. The attacker needs full control of a directly connected device. That device must be connected over a port channel that has UDLD enabled. To trigger arbitrary code execution, both the UDLD-enabled port channel and specific system conditions must exist. In the absence of either the UDLD-enabled port channel or the system conditions, attempts to exploit this vulnerability will result in a DoS condition.  It is possible, but highly unlikely, that an attacker could control the necessary conditions for exploitation. The CVSS score reflects this possibility. However, given the complexity of exploitation, Cisco has assigned a Medium Security Impact Rating (SIR) to this vulnerability.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-nxos-udld-rce-xetH6w35>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected the following Cisco products if they were running a vulnerable release of Cisco FXOS or NX-OS Software and had the UDLD feature enabled:    + Firepower 4100 Series ([CSCvv96092](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv96092) / [CSCvw38984](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38984)) 1   + Firepower 9300 Security Appliances ([CSCvv96092](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv96092) / [CSCvw38984](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38984)) 1   + MDS 9000 Series Multilayer Switches ([CSCvv96088](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv96088) / [CSCvw38981](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38981))   + Nexus 3000 Series Switches ([CSCvv78238](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv78238) / [CSCvw38964](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38964))   + Nexus 5500 Platform Switches ([CSCvv96090](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv96090) / [CSCvw38982](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38982))   + Nexus 5600 Platform Switches ([CSCvv96090](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv96090) / [CSCvw38982](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38982))   + Nexus 6000 Series Switches ([CSCvv96090](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv96090) / [CSCvw38982](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38982))   + Nexus 7000 Series Switches ([CSCvv96088](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv96088) / [CSCvw38981](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38981))   + Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode ([CSCvv78238](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv78238) / [CSCvw38964](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38964))   + UCS 6200 Series Fabric Interconnects ( [CSCvw45654](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw45654) )   + UCS 6300 Series Fabric Interconnects ( [CSCvw38983](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38983) )   + UCS 6400 Series Fabric Interconnects ( [CSCvv96107](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvv96107) / [CSCvw38995](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw38995) ) 1. Firepower 4100/9300 products do *not* officially support UDLD; however, the CLI includes commands to enable it. These products could be vulnerable only if UDLD has been enabled in error. In such cases, administrators are advised to disable UDLD to fully eliminate exposure to this vulnerability.  For information about which Cisco software releases were vulnerable at the time of publication, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Determine the Status of the UDLD Feature on Affected Devices Devices that are running a vulnerable software release and have the UDLD feature enabled are affected by this vulnerability. The following subsections provide details about how to determine whether the UDLD feature is enabled.  **Cisco FXOS Software and UCS Fabric Interconnects**  To determine whether the UDLD feature is enabled on a device, use the **scope org** command followed by the **show udld-link-policy** commands at the device CLI. The command output will display either *Enabled* or *Disabled* under *Admin State* for the default and for any manually configured UDLD link policy. The following example shows the command output on a device that has UDLD disabled:  ```   fxos# scope orgfxos# show udld-link-policyUDLD link policy:Name       Admin State UDLD mode---------- ----------- ---------default       Disabled    Normal   ```  **Cisco NX-OS Software**  To determine whether the UDLD feature is enabled on a device, use the **show running-config | include "feature udld"** command at the device CLI. If the command returns output, the *udld* feature is configured on the device. The following example shows the command output on a device that has UDLD enabled:  ```   nxos# show running-config | include "feature udld"feature udld   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + Firepower 1000 Series   + Firepower 2100 Series   + Nexus 1000 Virtual Edge for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 1000V Switch for Microsoft Hyper-V   + Nexus 1000V Switch for VMware vSphere   + Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in Application Centric Infrastructure (ACI) mode  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.

### Recommendation for SAN Analytics

We recommend to use the current release of Cisco MDS NX-OS. If you are using SAN Analytics and SAN Telemetry Streaming, we
recommend that you upgrade the NX-OS version of the switch to Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 8.4(1a) or later releases. See the Cisco
MDS NX-OS Release 8.4(1a) or later release notes for nondisruptive upgrade procedure.

Before upgrading from Cisco MDS NX-OS Release 8.2(x) or 8.3(x) to 8.4(1a) or later releases, ensure that you disable the SAN
Analytics feature using the feature analytics  command before upgrading and this is a one time requirement.
