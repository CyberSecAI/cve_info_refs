Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1395:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability exists because the web-based management interface of Cisco Unified Intelligence Center does not properly validate user-supplied input. This lack of input validation allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core weakness is a reflected XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the user's browser session when accessing the Cisco Unified Intelligence Center web interface.
*   **Sensitive Information Access:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive, browser-based information, including cookies and session tokens.
*   **Other Malicious Activities:** The attacker could potentially rewrite the content of the HTML page or perform other actions within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Link:** An attacker would need to persuade a user of the interface to click a specially crafted link. This could be achieved through various means, such as email or social engineering.
*   **Web-Based Management Interface:** The vulnerability resides within the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco products.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the target system.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker requires the ability to convince the user to click on the malicious link, meaning they have to have some ability to communicate with the victim.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Unified Intelligence Center, and products bundled with it, which include:
    *   Unified Contact Center Express (Unified CCX)
    *   Unified Contact Center Enterprise (Unified CCE)
    *   Packaged Contact Center Enterprise (Packaged CCE)
*   **No Workarounds:** Cisco has stated there are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*  **CVSS Score**: The vulnerability has a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.1, with the vector string CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, which is considered medium severity.

This information aligns with the official description of a reflected XSS vulnerability and provides additional context specific to Cisco products.
