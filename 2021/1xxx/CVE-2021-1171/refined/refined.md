Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-1171:

**1. Verification of Relevance:**

The provided content explicitly mentions CVE-2021-1171 in the security advisory "Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers Remote Command Execution and Denial of Service Vulnerabilities" and in the CSAF document associated with it, confirming it is related to this CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
*   The vulnerability is due to improper validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business routers. This improper validation allows for the injection of malicious code.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface.
*   **CWE-121:** The security advisory mentions CWE-121, which is "Stack-based Buffer Overflow".

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code as the *root* user on the underlying operating system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation can also cause the device to reload, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Full system compromise:** the arbitrary code execution as root gives a full system compromise to the attacker.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web-Based Management Interface:** Attackers exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected device through the web-based management interface.
*   The web-based management interface can be accessed from the local LAN or the WAN connection if remote management is enabled.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access**: To exploit the vulnerability, an attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.
*   **Network Access**: The attacker must have network access to the web-based management interface of the device.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The affected products are end-of-life, and Cisco will not release software updates to fix this vulnerability.
*   There are no workarounds available.
*   Cisco recommends migrating to newer Cisco Small Business RV series routers.
*   The advisory mentions that there are multiple vulnerabilities related to this security issue, but they are not dependent on one another.

This information provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its potential impact, and the necessary actions to mitigate the risk.
