Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1471:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from improper validation of certificates within Cisco Jabber.
*   **Weakness:**  The software fails to properly validate certificates, which allows for man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
*  **Attack Vector:** Network. An attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept traffic.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Inspect network traffic between the Cisco Jabber client and a server.
    *   Modify network traffic between the Cisco Jabber client and a server.
* **Affected products:** Cisco Jabber for Windows, Cisco Jabber for MacOS, and Cisco Jabber for mobile platforms (Android and iOS) are affected.
