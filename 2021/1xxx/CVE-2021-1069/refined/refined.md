Based on the provided documents, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-1069:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability lies within the `NVHost` function in the NVIDIA Tegra kernel driver and the NVIDIA SHIELD TV. A variable within this function can be null, which leads to a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   Null pointer dereference in `NVHost` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Abnormal reboot of the device.
*   Data loss due to the unexpected reboot.
*   The NVIDIA SHIELD TV bulletin lists the impact as â€œmay lead to abnormal reboot due to a null pointer reference, causing data loss."
*   The NVIDIA Jetson bulletin lists the impact as "may lead to a null pointer dereference and unexpected reboot, leading to data loss."

**Attack Vectors:**

*   Local access is required for exploitation. The CVSS vector string `AV:L` indicates that the attack vector is local.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to the affected device.
*   No special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability (PR:N)
*   No user interaction required for exploitation (UI:N)

**Affected Products:**

*   NVIDIA SHIELD TV
*   NVIDIA Jetson AGX Xavier Series
*   NVIDIA Jetson Xavier NX
*    NVIDIA Jetson TX1
*   NVIDIA Jetson TX2
*   NVIDIA Jetson Nano
*   NVIDIA Jetson Nano 2GB

**Affected Software:**

*   NVIDIA SHIELD TV Experience prior to 8.2.2
*   Linux for Tegra (L4T) versions prior to r32.5 for Jetson products

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is identified as a null pointer dereference, a common programming error that occurs when the program tries to access memory through a pointer that does not point to a valid location.
*   Both the SHIELD TV and Jetson bulletins reference the same CVE, indicating a common vulnerability in the `NVHost` function.

**Mitigation:**

*   Update NVIDIA SHIELD TV to Shield Experience Upgrade 8.2.2 or later.
*   Update Jetson devices to L4T release r32.5 or later.
