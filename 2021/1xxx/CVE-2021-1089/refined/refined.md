Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-1089:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `nvidia-smi` component of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows. It involves an uncontrolled DLL loading path.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled DLL loading path. The application loads DLLs from a location that can be influenced by a malicious actor. This allows an attacker to substitute a malicious DLL for a legitimate one.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
    - Arbitrary code execution
    - Denial of service (DoS)
    - Information disclosure
    - Data tampering

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required.
- The attack involves placing a malicious DLL in the path used by `nvidia-smi` for DLL loading.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to write to a directory that is searched for DLLs by `nvidia-smi`.
- The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious DLL with a name that matches what `nvidia-smi` is searching for.
