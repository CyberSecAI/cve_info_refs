      "CVE": "CVE-2021-1379",
      "description": "Multiple vulnerabilities in the Cisco Discovery Protocol and Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementations for Cisco IP Phone Series 68xx/78xx/88xx could allow an unauthenticated, adjacent attacker to execute code remotely or cause a reload of an affected IP phone. These vulnerabilities are due to missing checks when the IP phone processes a Cisco Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet. An attacker could exploit these vulnerabilities by sending a malicious Cisco Discovery Protocol or LLDP packet to the targeted IP phone. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute code on the affected IP phone or cause it to reload unexpectedly, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
