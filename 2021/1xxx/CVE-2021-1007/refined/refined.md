Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1007:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is related to a MAC address leak in the Bluetooth component of Android. The commit message "DatabaseManager : Remove mac address leakage" directly indicates this.
- Further detail in the second commit message, "Ensure proper hci le meta event length size", hints that the MAC address leak could be related to improper handling of HCI LE Meta events.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information disclosure vulnerability, where the device's MAC address could be exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  An attacker could potentially obtain the MAC address of the vulnerable device.
- This could lead to tracking and identification of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability resides within the Bluetooth system component (system/bt).
- The specific attack vector isn't described in detail, but it involves the processing of Bluetooth HCI LE meta events.
- An attacker could potentially leverage this via Bluetooth communication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be in a position to communicate with the device via Bluetooth.
- It is likely that no specific privilege is needed.
