Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1518:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user input within specific REST API commands of Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) On-Box Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation or sanitization of user-supplied input to the REST API, specifically on certain commands. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code.
*   **Remote Code Execution:** Due to the insufficient sanitization, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected device's underlying operating system.
*   **Compromised System:** The arbitrary code execution could allow attackers to completely compromise the affected system, potentially leading to data breaches, denial of service, or other malicious activities.
*   **Loss of Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The impact, as outlined in the CVSS vector, suggests that an exploit could result in a partial loss of confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network by sending a crafted HTTP request.
*   **REST API:** The attack vector is the REST API of the Cisco FDM On-Box Software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** An attacker needs valid low-privileged user credentials to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send the malicious HTTP request to the target system.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Cisco FDM On-Box Software. Specific vulnerable software releases are detailed in the provided documents.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. The advisory indicates specific fixed releases for various versions of Cisco FDM On-Box Software.
*   **No Workarounds:**  There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** The base CVSS v3.1 score is 6.3 (Medium Severity), with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-94 (Improper Control of Generation of Code).
