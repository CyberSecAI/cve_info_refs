Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-1474:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper neutralization of formula elements within the comma-separated value (CSV) file generated by the Admin audit log export feature in Cisco Umbrella.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSV Formula Injection: The system fails to sanitize data within the generated CSV files, allowing the injection of malicious formula elements.
- Improper neutralization of user-supplied input, leading to the execution of malicious formula elements when a user opens the CSV file in a spreadsheet application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject malicious formula elements into the CSV file.
- When a user opens the manipulated CSV file using a spreadsheet application, the injected formulas are executed.
- This can result in data manipulation within the CSV file and potentially arbitrary code execution on the user's computer.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker
- Authenticated access required (attacker must have a valid account)
- Requires user interaction (victim opens the malicious CSV)

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs a valid account to access the Cisco Umbrella service.
- The attacker needs to perform specific actions to inject malicious entries into the audit log.
