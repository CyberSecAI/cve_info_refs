Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the `splwow64.exe` process, which is the user-mode printer driver host process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds read:** The insufficient validation of user-provided input leads to a read operation that goes beyond the bounds of an allocated buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A local attacker can leverage this vulnerability to escalate privileges from low integrity to medium integrity. This enables the attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Attack:** The attack is local, requiring the attacker to already have the ability to execute code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-privileged code execution:** The attacker must initially be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in the `splwow64.exe` process.
*   Microsoft has released a patch to address this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability was reported to Microsoft on 2021-01-05, and publicly released on 2021-05-03.
