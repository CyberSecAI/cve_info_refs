Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1151:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
The content from `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com_9c14fe5d_20250115_121116.html` and `tools.cisco.com_042426ee_20250114_204437.html` explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-1151" along with other related CVEs (CVE-2021-1152, CVE-2021-1153, CVE-2021-1154, CVE-2021-1155, CVE-2021-1156, CVE-2021-1157, and CVE-2021-1158) in the context of a Cisco Security Advisory. The advisory discusses stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV series routers. This confirms the relevance of the content to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerabilities are caused by insufficient input validation in the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco routers.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities (CWE-79). The web-based management interface does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before displaying it.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected web-based management interface.
- An attacker can gain access to sensitive browser-based information (cookies, session tokens).
- The attacker could potentially take over an administrative session.

**5. Attack vectors:**
- An attacker sends crafted HTTP requests to the web-based management interface of the affected device.
- The attack requires the attacker to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device.
- The web interface is accessible through the local LAN interface and optionally through the WAN interface, if remote management is enabled.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials for the affected device.
- The attacker must have network access to the management interface of the affected device (either through the LAN or, if enabled, through the WAN).

**Additional Details:**
- Affected products: Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers.
- There are no workarounds that address the vulnerabilities.
- Cisco will not release software updates to fix this due to the devices' end-of-life status.
- The advisory recommends migrating to Cisco Small Business RV132W, RV160, or RV160W Routers.
- The advisory is rated as "Medium" severity with a base CVSS score of 4.8.
- The vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability.
- The advisory provides a link to a CSAF document for machine-readable vulnerability information.
- The vulnerability was reported by ADLab of Venustech.
- The `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com_caf5c355_20250115_121109.html` provides a structured, machine-readable format (CSAF) of the advisory.
- The `www.cisco.com_2b35d590_20250115_121102.html` confirms that the affected devices are end-of-life and provides replacement product information.
