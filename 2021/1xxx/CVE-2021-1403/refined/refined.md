      "Cross-Site WebSocket Hijacking (CSWSH)",
      "Insufficient HTTP protections"

      "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can conduct a CSWSH attack by persuading an authenticated user of the web UI to follow a crafted link."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to persuade an authenticated user of the web UI to follow a crafted link. The attacker does not need prior authentication to the device itself.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present in Cisco devices running vulnerable releases of Cisco IOS XE software with the HTTP server feature enabled. The default state of the HTTP Server is version and platform dependent. The HTTP Server feature is enabled if the 'ip http server' or 'ip http secure-server' commands are present in the device configuration. If the configuration also contains 'ip http active-session-modules none' (for HTTP) or 'ip http secure-active-session-modules none' (for HTTPS), the vulnerability is not exploitable over that specific protocol. No workarounds are available beyond disabling the HTTP server feature."
