Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1568:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled memory allocation within the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled Memory Allocation: The client software does not properly manage memory allocation when processing a specific crafted file. This leads to excessive memory usage when a crafted file is copied to a specific location, eventually causing a denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): A successful exploit allows an attacker to crash the VPN Agent service when the affected application is launched. This makes the service unavailable to all users of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker needs to have local access to the affected Windows system.
- File Copying: The attacker exploits the vulnerability by copying a specifically crafted file to a particular folder on the system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Valid Credentials: The attacker must have valid credentials on a multi-user Windows system.
- Local System Access: The attacker must have the ability to copy a file to a specific location on the target system.

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-1568 is a denial-of-service vulnerability affecting the Cisco AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows. A local, authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability by copying a crafted file to a specific folder, causing the VPN Agent service to crash and become unavailable. The vulnerability is due to uncontrolled memory allocation when processing the malicious file. The vulnerability is fixed in AnyConnect Secure Mobility Client for Windows release 4.10.01075 and later.
