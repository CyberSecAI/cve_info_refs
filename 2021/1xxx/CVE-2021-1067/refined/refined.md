- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the implementation of the RPMB (Replay Protected Memory Block) command status, which allows an attacker to write to the Write Protect Configuration Block.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper access control leading to unauthorized modification of protected memory regions.
- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Denial of service
    - Escalation of privileges
- **Attack vectors:** Physical access (AV:P) is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs physical access to the device. The attack requires no special privileges (PR:N) or user interaction (UI:N), and is scoped to the vulnerable system (S:U).
