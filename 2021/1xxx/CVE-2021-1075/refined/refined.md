- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for `DxgkDdiEscape`. The program dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that is no longer valid.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  A dangling pointer dereference vulnerability exists in the kernel mode driver (`nvlddmkm.sys`).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to code execution, denial of service, or escalation of privileges. The attacker has limited control over the data that is being modified.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs local, unprivileged access to the system and does not require user interaction.
