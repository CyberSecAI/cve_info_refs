Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-1178:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided data includes a Cisco Security Advisory specifically addressing multiple vulnerabilities in Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W routers.
*   CVE-2021-1178 is specifically mentioned within the "Details" section of the advisory as one of the vulnerabilities related to the web-based management interface.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability (CVE-2021-1178):**

*   **Improper Input Validation:** The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly validate user-supplied input within the web-based management interface.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Remote Command Execution:** By sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected device, an attacker could potentially execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The crafted requests could also lead to the device reloading, thus causing a denial of service.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Complete System Compromise:** Arbitrary code execution as root means the attacker gains full control of the device.
*   **Denial of Service:** The device can be rendered unavailable.
*  **Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability:** Successful exploitation results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Attack:** The vulnerabilities are exploitable through the web-based management interface over the network.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Crafted HTTP requests are the primary method of exploitation.
*   **UPnP traffic:** One vulnerability related to UPnP traffic can lead to a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code or cause an affected device to restart unexpectedly

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access (For CVE-2021-1178):** To exploit CVE-2021-1178 and the other web-based interface vulnerabilities, the attacker needs valid administrator credentials on the affected device.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the web interface of the router. This could be from the local LAN or, if remote management is enabled, the WAN.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **No Fix Available:** Cisco has stated that they will not be releasing software updates to address these vulnerabilities as the affected products have reached their end-of-life.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
*   **Migration Recommended:** Cisco advises users to migrate to their RV132W, RV160, or RV160W routers.
*   **Critical and High Severity:** The advisory initially rated these vulnerabilities as High SIR but was later changed to Critical SIR for the UPnP vulnerability and a High SIR for the web interface vulnerabilities, emphasizing the severity of the threat.
*   **CVE-2021-1164 has a CVSS Base Score of 9.8.** Other mentioned CVE's, including CVE-2021-1178 have a **CVSS Base Score of 7.2**

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-1178, along with other vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory, poses a significant risk to the affected Cisco Small Business routers. A remote attacker with valid admin credentials can execute arbitrary code or cause a denial of service. There are no available fixes or workarounds, making device migration to newer models the recommended course of action.
