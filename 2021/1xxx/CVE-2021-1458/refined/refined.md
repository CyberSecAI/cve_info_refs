Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-1458:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**
   - The provided CSAF document directly includes CVE-2021-1458 and its associated Cisco Bug ID `CSCvw93513`. This confirms that the content is relevant to the specified CVE.
   - The advisory cisco-sa-fmc-xss-yT8LNSeA also mentions CVE-2021-1458 along with the other related CVEs.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** by the web-based management interface of Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software. This lack of proper input sanitization allows for the injection of malicious code.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - The primary vulnerability is **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)**.
    - The vulnerability exists within the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco FMC software versions.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - A successful exploit could allow an attacker to:
       - **Execute arbitrary script code** in the context of the user's browser session interacting with the vulnerable web interface.
       - **Access sensitive, browser-based information**, such as cookies or session tokens.
   - This can lead to account hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions carried out under the guise of a trusted user.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - The attack vector is **remote and network-based**.
   - Attackers exploit this by persuading a user of the FMC interface to click a crafted link that contains malicious scripts.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious link with XSS payload.
   - The attacker needs a way to deliver the link to a user of the FMC web interface, typically via social engineering (e.g., phishing).
   - The attacker does *not* need to be authenticated to the FMC interface initially, but the crafted link is intended to affect authenticated users.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:**
    *   Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software releases 6.4.0.11 and earlier
    *   FMC Software releases earlier than 6.6.3
    *   FMC Software releases earlier than 6.7.0.2
*   **Fixed Releases:**
    *   Cisco FMC Software releases 6.6.4 and 6.7.0.2 and later contain the fix.
    *   Cisco expected to fix this in version 6.4.0.12 by May 2021
*   **Workarounds:** There are no known workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   **CVSS Score:** Base score of 4.8, rated as MEDIUM severity.
*   **CWE:** CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting'))
*   **Discovery:** The vulnerabilities were found by Sanmith Prakash of Cisco during internal security testing.
*   **No known exploits:** At the time of the advisory, there were no public announcements or known exploits.

In summary, CVE-2021-1458 is a medium severity XSS vulnerability in Cisco FMC software arising from insufficient input validation that could be exploited via crafted links to execute arbitrary code on the browsers of users interacting with the FMC web interface.
