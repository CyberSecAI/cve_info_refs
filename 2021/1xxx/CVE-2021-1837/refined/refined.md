- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A certificate validation issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper certificate validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker in a privileged network position may be able to alter network traffic.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack, exploiting a privileged network position.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be in a privileged network position to intercept and modify network traffic.
