  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper error handling when an IPv6-configured interface receives a specific type of ICMPv6 packet.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Memory leak vulnerability due to improper error handling"
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a system memory leak in the ICMPv6 process on the device, leading to the process running out of system memory and stopping processing traffic. The device could then drop all ICMPv6 packets, causing traffic instability on the device. Restoring device functionality would require a device reboot.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Sending a sustained rate of crafted ICMPv6 packets to a local IPv6 address on a targeted device."

    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker with the ability to send crafted ICMPv6 packets to the targeted device."
