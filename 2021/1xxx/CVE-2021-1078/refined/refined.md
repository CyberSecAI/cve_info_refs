Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-1078:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver's kernel driver (`nvlddmkm.sys`).
- It involves a NULL pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- NULL pointer dereference. This occurs when the code attempts to access a memory location through a pointer that has a NULL value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a system crash (denial of service).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L).
- The attack requires low privileges (PR:L).
- User interaction is not required (UI:N)
- Scope is unchanged (S:U)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to have low level privileges on the system.
- The attacker does not require any user interaction

**Summary:**
The vulnerability is a NULL pointer dereference within the `nvlddmkm.sys` driver, that could lead to system crashes. An attacker with local, low-privileged access can trigger this vulnerability without requiring any user interaction, which results in denial of service.
