{
  "CVE_data": {
    "Primary_content": {
      "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to incorrect validations of parameters passed to a configuration file that is executed when the device boots up.",
      "Weaknesses": [
        "improper checks performed by system boot routines"
      ],
      "Impact of exploitation": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to execute unsigned code at boot time and bypass the software image verification check part of the secure boot process of an affected device.",
      "Attack vectors": [
        "local access"
      ],
       "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need privileged access to the CLI of the device."
    },
    "Other_content": [
      {
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "This vulnerability is due to an improper check on the area of code that manages the verification of boot configuration files during the initial fast reload boot process.",

           "improper check on the area of code that manages the verification of boot configuration files"

             "local access"
