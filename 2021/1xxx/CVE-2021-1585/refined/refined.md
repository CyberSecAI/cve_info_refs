Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-1585:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The primary cause is a lack of proper signature verification for code exchanged between the Cisco Adaptive Security Device Manager (ASDM) and its Launcher application. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary code during the communication process.
*   Additionally, the ASDM client does not validate the server's SSL certificate, enabling man-in-the-middle (MITM) attacks.
*   The vulnerability is also due to the fact that the ASDM launcher trusts the content it receives from the ASA, without performing any code signing checks

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An unauthenticated, remote attacker can execute arbitrary code on a user's system.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) Vulnerability:** Due to the lack of SSL certificate verification, an attacker can intercept and modify traffic between the ASDM Launcher and the ASDM server.
*   **Drive-by Download:** A secondary vulnerability exists where an attacker can persuade a user to retrieve an arbitrary file via the communication between the Launcher and ASDM by spoofing a different launcher version.
*  **Lack of Code Signing:** The ASDM launcher does not perform proper code signing checks

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the user's operating system with the privileges of the ASDM Launcher.
*   **Compromised System:** An attacker could gain full control over the administrator's system.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could manipulate data, install backdoors, or perform other malicious actions.
*   **Drive-by download:** An attacker can make a user download malicious content by spoofing the version.
*   **Credential Theft:** User-entered credentials could be passed to the malicious code.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker intercepts network traffic between the ASDM Launcher and the ASDM server.
*   **Malicious Server:** The attacker sets up a malicious server to mimic an ASA device.
*  **Social engineering:** Requires some form of social engineering to make the user initiate communication from the Launcher to the ASDM

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to perform a MITM attack or act as a malicious server.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand the ASDM communication protocol and how to craft malicious code.
*   **Social Engineering:** Some social engineering may be needed to persuade a user to initiate a connection to the malicious server or download malicious software.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco ASDM releases earlier than 7.18.1.152 are vulnerable.
*  **Cisco Bug ID:** CSCvw79912
*   **CVSS Score:** Base score of 7.5 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrade to Cisco ASDM Release 7.18.1.152 or later.
*   **Workaround:** No workarounds are available.

**Vulnerability Timeline:**

*   **2020-12-14:** Vulnerability disclosed to Cisco PSIRT.
*   **2021-02-09:** Incident manager assigned.
*   **2021-03-05:** Cisco confirmed RCE/Drive-by-download findings.
*   **2021-07-07:** Cisco published an advisory without a full fix.
*   **2022-08-11:** Rapid7 published follow-on research highlighting that the original fix was incomplete.
* **2022-08-25** Cisco added indicators of compromise.

**Exploitation:**

*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit, "staystaystay", demonstrates how the vulnerability can be used to obtain a reverse shell on the victim's machine.
*   The exploit also showcases a drive-by download attack by spoofing the launcher version, tricking the launcher to open a browser to a malicious URL, and prompting the user to install malware.
*   The exploit makes use of a custom SGZ format to deliver malicious java code, without code signing

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was initially discovered by Malcolm Lashley, and further investigated by Rapid7.
*   Cisco has acknowledged the issue and released software updates, but the vulnerability can still be exploited even with the patch by clicking the "Yes" button that appears after connection to a non-patched server.
*   Cisco indicated that the lack of SSL certificate validation was by design, though they acknowledged the security concern.
