Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1238:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) web-based management interface's failure to properly validate user-supplied input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The core weakness is that the system doesn't sanitize user inputs, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are then stored and later executed in other users' browsers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Script Code Execution: A successful exploit allows the attacker to run arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the affected web interface.
- Access to Sensitive Browser Information: The attacker can gain access to sensitive, browser-based information, including cookies and session tokens.
- Potential for Account Hijacking: By stealing cookies or session tokens, the attacker can hijack user sessions and take over accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Crafted Link: The primary attack vector is persuading a user of the interface to click on a maliciously crafted link.
- Web-based Management Interface: The vulnerability is in the web-based management interface of the Cisco FMC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated, Remote Attacker: The attacker needs to be authenticated to the FMC and can be remote.
- User Interaction: The attack requires some level of user interaction, specifically that the targeted user clicks the malicious link.
