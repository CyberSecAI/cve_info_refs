Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-1548:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper validation of user-supplied input** within the web-based management interface of affected Cisco Small Business Wireless Access Points.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands into the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute commands with *root* privileges on the affected device. This can lead to full system compromise.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability:** The CVSS score indicates a low impact to confidentiality, integrity, and availability. However, with root access, an attacker can potentially cause significant harm to the device and its network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely through the web-based management interface.
*   **HTTP Requests:** Attackers send crafted HTTP requests to the management interface to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Credentials:** An attacker needs valid administrative credentials for the targeted device to exploit this vulnerability. This means that the attacker must have already compromised the device's authentication mechanism or has legitimate access.

**Affected Products:**

The following Cisco Small Business Wireless Access Points and firmware releases are vulnerable:

*   WAP121 Wireless-N Access Point with Single Point Setup (1.0.6.8 and earlier)
*   WAP125 Wireless-AC Dual Band Desktop Access Point with PoE (1.0.3.1 and earlier)
*   WAP131 Wireless-N Dual Radio Access Point with PoE (1.0.2.17 and earlier)
*   WAP150 Wireless-AC/N Dual Radio Access Point with PoE (1.1.2.4 and earlier)
*    WAP321 Wireless-N Access Point with Single Point Setup (1.0.6.7 and earlier)
*   WAP351 Wireless-N Dual Radio Access Point with 5-Port Switch (1.0.2.17 and earlier)
*   WAP361 Wireless-AC/N Dual Radio Wall Plate Access Point with PoE (1.1.2.4 and earlier)
*   WAP581 Wireless-AC Dual Radio Wave 2 Access Point with 2.5GbE LAN (1.0.3.1 and earlier)

**Additional Notes:**

*   Cisco has released software updates for some of the affected devices to address the vulnerabilities.
*   Cisco has announced end-of-life for the WAP121, WAP131, WAP321, and WAP351 access points and will not be providing firmware updates for these devices. Customers are advised to migrate to newer models.
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
* The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-77, which is related to command injection
*  CVSS Base score of 4.7 is assigned to this vulnerability.
