      "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities are due to improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface.",
      "weaknesses": [

      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the underlying operating system, leading to complete system compromise.",
     "attack_vector": "The attack vector is remote and the vulnerabilities can be exploited through the web-based management interface by sending crafted HTTP requests.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to have valid administrator credentials on an affected device to exploit these vulnerabilities."
