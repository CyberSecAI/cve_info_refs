Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1026:

**CVE-2021-1026**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the package name provided by the caller when starting a ranging operation in `RttServiceImpl`. Specifically, the UID is not being checked against the provided package name to ensure they match, allowing an attacker to supply a fake package name.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `RttServiceImpl` does not adequately verify that the calling application's UID corresponds to the provided package name.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to gain access to sensitive information or perform actions they should not be authorized to do within the context of the Wi-Fi RTT service. The specific impact is further defined as information disclosure.

*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A malicious application could call the `startRanging` method in `RttServiceImpl` with a fake package name which does not match the application's UID.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to execute code on the device (i.e. through a malicious application installed on the device)

**Additional Details:**
*   The fix involves enforcing a UID-to-package name check in `RttServiceImpl#startRanging` to validate that the caller is not providing a fake package name that is not theirs.
*   The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity and information disclosure.
