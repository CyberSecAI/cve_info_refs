  "vulnerability": {
    "CVE": "CVE-2021-1440",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the implementation of the Resource Public Key Infrastructure (RPKI) feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause the Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) process to crash, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to the incorrect handling of a specific RPKI to Router (RTR) Protocol packet header.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of RPKI to Router (RTR) Protocol packet header."
    ],
    "impact": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a DoS condition because the BGP process could constantly restart and BGP routing could become unstable.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Compromising the RPKI validator server and sending a specifically crafted RTR packet to an affected device.",
      "Using man-in-the-middle techniques to impersonate the RPKI validator server and sending a specifically crafted RTR response packet over the established RTR TCP connection to the affected device."
     ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability.",
      "affected_products": "Cisco devices running Cisco IOS XR Software releases 4.3.0 through 7.3.0 with RPKI configured and in use."
