This vulnerability occurs because the default configuration is applied for console authentication and authorization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the console port and authenticating as a read-only user. A successful exploit could allow a user with read-only permissions to access administrative privileges.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-esc-rSNVvTf9>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected universal Cisco IOS XE Software earlier than the first fixed release if it was running in Controller mode. Cisco IOS XE Software releases earlier than Release 17.2.1r are not affected by this vulnerability because they do not include the SD-WAN feature. For additional information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected all *standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software* releases earlier than the first fixed release  **Note:** The standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN release images are separate from the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases. The SD-WAN feature set was first integrated into the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases starting with IOS XE Software Release 17.2.1r. For additional information, see the [Install and Upgrade Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r and Later](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/install-upgrade-17-2-later.html) chapter of the *Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide*.  For additional information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software in autonomous mode   + IOS XR Software   + NX-OS Software   + SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator Software   + SD-WAN vEdge Routers   + SD-WAN vManage Software   + SD-WAN vSmart Controller Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**:     By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search. Standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software At the time of publication, standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software releases 16.12(5) and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:P/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 6.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 6.6 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 6.6 |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Cisco IOS XE Image Compatibility

| Deployment Image Version | Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN | Non Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco IOS XE Releases 16.9.x, 16.10.x, 16.11.x, 16.12.x | ucmk9 | universalk9 |
| Cisco IOS XE Release 17.1.x | NA | universalk9 |
| Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.x and later | universalk9\* | universalk9\*\* |

* \* For Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN use case, non-LI and non-payload encryption image types are not supported.
* \*\* For non Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN use case, non-LI and non-payload encryption image types are supported (universalk9\_noli, universalk9\_npe, universalk9\_npe\_noli).

## Upgrade Considerations

The following Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices support multirate interfaces and support the 1GE small form-factor pluggable (SFP) (optical and CU) and 10GE SFP+ (optical
and CU) modules on their 10G interfaces ports:

* Cisco ASR 1001-HX Router
* Cisco Catalyst 8500-12X4QC
* Cisco Catalyst 8500-12X

These devices support auto-negotiation on 10G interfaces ports with 1GE SFP (optical and CU) modules. The following notes
apply to auto-negotiation in both SD-WAN and non-SD-WAN modes of the above three router models only:

* For releases before Cisco IOS XE 17.6.1a, auto-negotiation can be configured using the CLI.
* For releases before Cisco IOS XE 17.6.1a, if you use the CLI or Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN to reboot a device with a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module, that interface will not come up. In this situation,
  use Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN or the CLI to configure `no negotiation auto` for the interface, then reboot the device.
* From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, `auto neg` values for auto-negotiation are pushed to 10G interfaces on supported devices through feature templates. Ensure that you
  know which SFP module is on which 10G interface on a device so that you can properly configure the feature template.
* On software releases upto Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, the `negotiation auto` command is not supported on a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module.
* From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.4 onwards, the negotiation auto command is supported on a 10G interface with 10 GE SFP+ module.
  In this scenario, in the output of `show interface Tengig x/x/x`, the link type is force-up regardless of `negotiation auto/no negotiation auto` configuration. The same is applicable when the configurations are pushed through Cisco SD-WAN Manager template.
* From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.4 onwards, the negotiation auto command is supported on a 10G interface that includes a 1GE
  Fiber and Copper SFP.
* On software releases upto Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, the `no negotiation auto` command with the default OFF option must be sent through a feature template to all 10G interfaces that include a 10GE SFP+
  module. Otherwise, the template push fails.
* Before upgrading to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a, use a feature template, a CLI add-on feature templates, or the CLI to `apply no negotiation auto` to all 10G interfaces that include a 10GE SFP+ module.
* If you upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.6.3a from a release in which auto-negotiation was enabled on a 10G interface that
  includes a 10GE SFP+ module, that interface will not come up. In this situation, use the CLI to configure `no negotiation auto` for the interface after the upgrade completes.
* Before upgrading to Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Manager Release 20.12.1 or Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.12.1a or later releases, contact Cisco TAC to check and drop any non-compatible indexes. Non-compatible old index can impact successful
  upgrade to newer version.
* In ASR 1001-HX, multi-rate supported only on last 4 ports of bay1 8X10G/1G.

Following notes are applicable for C8300, C8500L-8S4X models of routers:

* From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.15.1 onwards, the `negotiation auto` command is supported on a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module.
* From Cisco IOS XE Release 17.15.1 onwards, on a 10G interface that includes a 10GE SFP+ module, in the output of `show interface Tengig x/x/x` the link type will show as force-up always regardless of `negotiation auto/no negotiation auto` configuration. The same is applicable when the configurations are pushed through Cisco SD-WAN Manager template.

Table 2. Auto Negotiation Configurations

| **C8500** | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SFPs | Default Auto Negotiation | Default Speed | Default Duplex |
| 1G Copper | OFF | 1000M | Full |
| 1G Optical | OFF | 1000M | Full |
| 10G Optical | OFF | 10000M | Full |
| **C8300** | | | |
| 1G Copper | ON | 1000M | Full |
| 1G Optical | ON | 1000M | Full |
| 10G Optical | ON | 10000M | Full |

| **Note** | ---   Ensure that negotiation configuration matches with the peer device interface settings. If there is a mismatch in the interface settings, the interface may go down.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Restrictions

### Restrictions for single "universalk9" image

* Dual-IOSd is supported only in autonomous mode.
* Images without payload encryption and NO-LI (universalk9\_npe, universalk9\_noli, universalk9\_npe\_noli) images are not supported
  in controller mode. Only universalk9 images are supported.
* After onboarding and determining the mode of operation, changing from Controller mode to Autonomous mode or vice-versa, results
  in the loss of configuration.
* Reset button functionality is not supported in controller mode on Cisco ISR 1000 series Integrated Service Routers. The reset
  button does not function to restore a golden image or configuration in controller mode.
* Auto-install (Python and TCL scripts) and ZTP—Autoinstall and ZTP are not supported in controller mode. If DHCP discovers
  an attempt to install using either of these processes, a mode change to Autonomous mode is triggered.
* WebUI—In controller mode, WebUI is not supported and an error message is displayed, if used.

## Self-Signed Trustpoint

A self-signed trustpoint is generated and loaded to a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device when the device boots up. If this trustpoint is deleted for any reason, you can generate and load a new trustpoint by rebooting
the device. The new key may be different than the deleted one.

## Introducing Autonomous and Controller Mode

The Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r release introduces two installation modes – Autonomous and Controller modes. The autonomous mode supports the functionality
of Cisco IOS XE non Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN deployment and the controller mode supports the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN solution.

The following are the main differences between Autonomous mode and Controller mode:

Table 3.

| Feature | Autonomous Mode | Controller Mode |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Configuration Method | * Command Line Interface (CLI) * NETCONF | YANG-based configuration   * Cisco SD-WAN Manager * NETCONF |
| Onboarding Modes | * Plug and Play * Config-Wizard * WebUI * Bootstrap (USB, bootflash, and so on) * Auto-Install (Python Script, TCL Script) * ZTP (Using DHCP Option 150 and Option 67) | * Plug and Play * Bootstrap (USB, bootflash, and so on) |
| Licensing | Cisco Smart Licensing | Cisco High Performance Security (HSEC) software licensing. No device licensing. |
| Image Type | Universalk9 | Universalk9 |
| Dual-IOSd redundancy model | Supported | Not Supported |
| High Availability | Supported | Not Supported |
| Global configuration mode | configure terminal | config-transaction |

### Install a Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Platform

Table 4. Feature History

| Feature Name | Release Information | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Support for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Platform on OpenStack Train | Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.7.1a | This feature introduces support for managing a Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge software platform hosted in the OpenStack cloud computing platform "Train" release. |

Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.4.1a, Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN supports the Cisco Catalyst 8000V virtual router platform, which replaces the Cisco CSR1000V and Cisco ISRv. Installing the Cisco Catalyst 8000V in an Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN environment requires Cisco vManage Release 20.4.1 or later.

Download the Cisco Catalyst 8000V software image that is appropriate for your method of deployment. For example, this can be an OVA file for ESXi, or a QCOW2
image for OpenStack or KVM. Do not choose an ISO image. Have the image ready to upload to the Cisco SD-WAN Manager software image repository. The file name begins with: c8000v-universalk9

| **Note** | ---   To operate with Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, the device must be in controller mode. When starting the device in controller mode, boot the device using the bootflash:packages.conf file.   --- |
| --- | --- |

For complete information about the platform, including installation in KVM, ESXi, and OpenStack environments, see the [Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Installation and Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/C8000V/Configuration/c8000v-installation-configuration-guide.html). For information about creating a bootstrap file for onboarding the Cisco Catalyst 8000V into Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, see [Bootstrap Process for ​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Cloud-Hosted Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/install-upgrade-17-2-later.html#bootstrap-process-sd-wan-cloud-hosted-devices).

#### Clean Install

We recommend a clean install of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V. This ensures support for all features, provides the most up-to-date licensing, and ensures that devices and the controller
stay synchronized. For cases where upgrade is necessary, see the procedure in **Upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r or Later**.

| **Note** | ---   After a clean install of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V, it is not possible to downgrade the device to a release earlier than Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.4.1a.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Upgrading a Cisco CSR1000V to a Cisco Catalyst 8000V

Upgrading a Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco ISRv virtual router to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.4.1a includes upgrading to the Cisco Catalyst 8000V. Note the following:

* The Cisco Catalyst 8000V preserves all of the functionality available on Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco ISRv platforms.
* Performing the upgrade in Cisco SD-WAN Manager preserves the configuration of the device(s) being upgraded.

#### OpenStack

Installing a Cisco Catalyst 8000V on the OpenStack Train release requires using a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.7.1a or later image for the Cisco Catalyst 8000V.

Cisco does not support installing a Cisco Catalyst 8000V on OpenStack using an earlier image, or installing on OpenStack using an earlier image and upgrading to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.7.1a.

## Plug and Play in Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r and Later Releases

* [Plug and Play Onboarding Workflow](#plug-and-play-onboarding-workflow)
* [Mode Discovery with Plug and Play Onboarding](#mode-discovery-with-pnp-onboarding)
* [Automatic IP Address Detection](#Cisco_Concept.dita_e27e49b5-3224-4605-83d4-8be5267c067b)

### Plug and Play Onboarding Workflow

1. Place an order for the device in Cisco Commerce with Smart Account and Virtual Account details of the customer.
2. The device information from Cisco Commerce like Device serial number, Smart Account, and Virtual Account are added to the
   Plug and Play portal.
3. Add a Cisco SD-WAN Validator controller profile into the Plug and Play (PnP) portal for the same Smart Account and Virtual Accounts.
4. Associate the new device to the Cisco SD-WAN Validator controller profile manually.
5. PnP sends all relevant information including Cisco SD-WAN Validator details, device serial number, organization name, and network ID to Zero Touch Provisioning (ZTP).
6. Download the device serial number file (provisioning file) from PnP and upload it to Cisco SD-WAN Manager. The devices are now available on Cisco SD-WAN Manager. You can also use the Sync Smart Account option on Cisco SD-WAN Manager to sync the device with your virtual account and populate the device in Cisco SD-WAN Manager.

| **Note** | ---   If you created and scheduled a device template on Cisco vManage Release 20.3.x and upgraded Cisco SD-WAN Manager to Cisco vManage Release 20.4.1 or later before onboarding the target device, when you onboard the device using PNP or ZTP, the template push fails. To avoid this failure, reschedule the template after upgrading the Cisco SD-WAN Manager software and then onboard the device.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  If the ZTP process for a device is interrupted because the device reloads or power cycles, the ZTP process does not restart and the device comes online with the Cisco SD-WAN Manager image that was in its original configuration. In this situation, upgrade the device to the desired Cisco SD-WAN Manager release manually.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   For more information, refer to the [Plug and Play Support Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/en_us/services/downloads/SD-WAN_pnp_support_guide.pdf).   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Mode Discovery with Plug and Play Onboarding

The PnP-based discovery process determines the mode in which the device operates, based on the controller discovery and initiates
a mode change, if required. The mode change results in a reboot of the device. Once reboot is complete, the device performs
appropriate discovery process.

When you upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r or later, on a Cisco device that already runs a Cisco IOS XE or Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN image, the device starts in autonomous mode or controller mode depending on the configured controller.

Plug and Play (PnP) deployment include the following discovery process scenarios:

Table 5.

| Boot up Mode | Deployment Mode | On-boarding agent | Cisco SD-WAN Validator | Discovery Process | Mode Change |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Autonomous | Cisco Digital Network Architecture (DNA) | Plug and Play | No | Plug and Play Connect Discovery or on-premise plug and play server discovery | No Mode change |
| Autonomous | Cisco SD-WAN Manager | Plug and Play | Yes | Plug and Play Connect Discovery | Mode change to controller mode |
| Controller | Cisco DNA | Plug and Play | No | Plug and Play Connect Discovery or on-premise plug and play server discovery | Mode change to autonomous mode |
| Controller | Cisco SD-WAN Manager | Plug and Play | Yes | Plug and Play Connect Discovery | No mode change |

### Automatic IP Address Detection

Table 6. Feature History

| Feature Name | Release Information | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Day 0 WAN Interface Automatic IP Detection using ARP | Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.7.1a  Cisco SD-WAN Release 20.7.1  Cisco vManage Release 20.7.1 | This feature enables a device to automatically learn about the available IP addresses and default gateway information when a DHCP server is not available. The device assigns an IP address to its WAN interface, and then contacts the PnP server and begins the PnP onboarding process. |

Typically, the WAN interface on a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device or Cisco vEdge device is configured
as a DHCP client, and this interface receives an IP address and gateway server
information from the DHCP server during the plug-and-play (PnP) onboarding process.

If the DHCP server is not available, the device automatically learns about the available
IP addresses and default gateway information by using Address Resolution Protocol (ARP)
packets. If an IP address that the device learns allows a successful connection to the
PnP server, the device continues with the PnP onboarding process.

| **Note** | ---   This feature applies only to day zero deployments and is enabled by default.   --- |

**Prerequisites for Automatic IP Address Detection**

* To trigger ARP, configure the IP address of the device as the BGP neighbor on the provider edge (PE) router.

  This PE router is the first point of contact for the device in the WAN transport network. The PE router then sends ARP packets
  with this IP address to the device. The device receives the ARP packets, and then the Automatic IP Address Detection feature
  defines the ARP destination IP address as the device's WAN interface IP address.
* For Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices, the network mask of this IP address must be 30 bits.
* For automatic IP address detection and redirection through an on-premises ZTP server, the A record of the ZTP server on the
  DNS server must be set to ztp.cisco.com. In addition, the DNS server must have an ip name-server value of 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4.

For automatic IP address detection, a device uses 8.8.8.8 or 8.8.4.4 as the DNS server to
resolve devicehelper.cisco.com or ztp.cisco.com. The PnP process then attempts to reach
devicehelper.cisco.com or ztp.cisco.com to continue onboarding.

| **Note** | ---  An IP address that a device automatically detects is not preserved during reboots of the device that occur before the PnP onboarding completes. In such cases, an IP address is assigned automatically when the PE router ARP cache expires.  --- |
| --- | --- |

**Limitations and Restrictions for Automatic IP Address Detection**

The following limitations and restrictions apply only to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN devices:

* This feature is supported only on Cisco 1000 Series Integrated Service Routers,
  Cisco 4000 Series Integrated Service Router, and Cisco Catalyst 8200 and 8300
  Series Edge Platforms. On these devices, this features is supported only for
  Gigabit Ethernet Interface 0/0/0.
* The feature is supported only on devices that are in controller (SD-WAN configuration) mode. See <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/install-upgrade-17-2-later.html>.
* This feature is supported only in a simple 30 bit network mask Layer 2 network in
  which one PE router and one customer edge router are in the same VLAN.
* This feature does not support VRRP, HSRP, or GLBP on the PE router.
* An ARP destination IP address is used as the WAN interface IP address on a device
  only after the device receives the same ARP request eight times within an
  interval of 150 seconds.

### Creating a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Bootstrap Configuration File

See [On-Site Bootstrap Process for ​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Devices](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/hardware-and-software-installation.html#c_On_Site_Bootstrap_Process_for_SD_WAN_Devices_12488.xml) and [Generate a Bootstrap File For Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Devices Using the CLI](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/hardware-and-software-installation.html#generate-bootstrap-file-using-cli) for information about generating a bootstrap file.

### New Installation: Mode Change Device Day Zero Scenario

1. If the device is running a pre-17.2 universalk9 image on a new box, or for an existing box where you performed write erase  and reload  and loaded a Cisco IOS XE 17.2 or newer image, the device boots in day zero configuration and in autonomous mode.
2. The new device determines if a mode change is required based on the bootstrap file.

   * If ciscosdwan.cfg or ciscosdwan\_cloud\_init.cfg bootstrap file in a plugged in the bootstrap location, mode change to controller
     mode is initiated. After the device boots up in controller mode, the configuration present in the configuration file is applied.
   * If a ciscortr.cfg bootstrap file or config-wizard is discovered, mode change is not initiated and the boot up continues in
     the Autonomous mode.

| **Note** | ---  * The bootstrap file (ciscosdwan.cfg) is generated by Cisco SD-WAN Manager, and has UUID, but no OTP. * For software devices (Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software, Cisco Cloud Services Router 1000V Series, and Cisco ISRv), and for OTP-authenticated devices such as the Cisco ASR1002-X, use the bootstrap file ciscosdwan\_cloud\_init.cfg.   This file has OTP but no UUID validation.  --- |
| --- | --- |

### Switch Modes Using Cisco CLI

Use the controller-mode command in privileged EXEC mode to switch between controller and autonomous modes.

#### Autonomous Mode

The controller-mode reset command takes the device back to day zero configuration.

```
Device# controller-mode reset
```

The controller-mode disable command switches the device to autonomous mode.

```
Device# controller-mode disable
```

| **Note** | ---   controller-mode disable should only be used for temporarily operating the device in autonomous mode. Ensure the device is returned to controller mode using the same image.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Controller Mode

| **Note** | ---   To switch the device to the controller-mode, boot the system using either the bootflash:/\*.bin or bootflash:/packages.conf file.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   If bootflash:core or harddisk:core contain core files (files containing information about process crashes), move the files to another location before changing the device to controller mode. If these files remain in the bootflash:core or harddisk:core directories, Cisco SD-WAN Manager displays an alarm after onboarding the device. You can move the files to any other directory on the device other than a core directory.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The controller-mode enable command switches the device to controller mode.

```
Device# controller-mode enable
```

#### Notes

| Note | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Bundle mode | If device is booted with bundle mode (Super packages), after reboot, the image gets automatically expanded and activated to prepare the router for SDWAN operation. Devices with 4GB RAM may require an additional reboot to free up space in /bootflash. The following devices with 4GB RAM need reload:   * Cisco ISR 4451 * Cisco ISR 4431 * Cisco ISR 4461 * Cisco ISR 4351 * Cisco ISR 4331 * Cisco ISR 4321 |
| Viewing the contents of the bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller directory | You cannot view the contents of the bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller directory of a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device in either of the following conditions:   * The device is in controller mode.  or * The device is in autonomous mode and using Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.6.1a or later. |

## Mode Discovery and Mode Change with Bootstrap Files

| **Note** | ---   If your Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device is already running an older Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN configuration version or file and when you upgrade your device from Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 16.x to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r or later, the device boots up in the controller mode. To prevent the device from booting up in the controller mode, before performing the device upgrade, ensure that you remove the stale Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN configuration file from the bootflash.  Detailed steps to delete all Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN artifacts from bootflash:  delete /force bootflash:/ciscosdwan\*.cfg  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.sdwaninstallerfs  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.sdwaninternal  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/sdwan  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/vmanage-admin  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.cdb\_backup  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.installer/active  delete /force /recursive bootflash:/.installer   --- |
| --- | --- |

On a device that already runs a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN image, after upgrading to a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r or later image, the device boots up in controller mode.

| **Note** | ---   Installing the Cisco Catalyst 8000V on OpenStack requires using the Cisco Catalyst 8000V image for Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.7.1a or later.   --- |
| --- | --- |

Use the controller-mode enable  command to switch from autonomous to controller mode and the controller-mode disable  command to switch from controller mode to autonomous mode.

To switch modes using CLI, ensure that the appropriate configuration files mentioned in the table below are present. After
the device boots up, the configuration present in the configuration file is applied. The device reads the configuration file
and uses the configuration information to come up on the network.

Table 7. Configuration File Prerequisites for Mode Change

| Current Mode | Mode change to | Platforms | Configuration file and location |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Controller | Autonomous | All supported platforms | ciscortr.cfg in any file system available to the device |
| Autonomous | Controller | * Cisco Cloud Services Router, CSR1000v * Cisco Integrated Services Virtual Router, ISRv * Cisco Catalyst 8000V * Cisco ASR1002-X | ciscosdwan\_cloud\_init.cfg on bootflash, USB, CDROM0, or CDROM1 |
| Autonomous | Controller | * Cisco Aggregation Services Router, ASR 1000 Series * Cisco Integration Service Routers, ISR 4000 series and ISR 1000 series routers | ciscosdwan.cfg on bootflash or USB |

| **Note** | ---   On a Cisco CSR1000v device (for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2 or later) and a Cisco Catalyst 8000V (for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.4 or later) image deployment, if you want to boot up the device in controller mode, load the bootstrap file generated by Cisco SD-WAN Manager by bootstrap (ESXi, KVM, and OpenStack) or user-data (AWS) or custom-data (Azure and GCP).  The following fields must be present in the ciscosdwan\_cloud\_init.cfg bootstrap file:   * otp * uuid * vbond * org  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   When the device mode is switched from autonomous to controller, the startup configuration and the information in NVRAM (certificates), are erased. This action is equivalent to running the write erase  command.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   When the device mode is switched from controller to autonomous, all Yang-based configuration is preserved and can be reused if you switch back to controller mode.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   When the device is in Day N configuration and is reloaded, the presence of a bootstrap file does not impact the device operating mode.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   You cannot view the contents of the bootflash:/.sdwaninstaller directory and .sdwanistallerfs file of a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device in either of the following conditions:   * The device is in controller mode.  or * The device is in autonomous mode and using Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.6.1a or later.   Directory, more, copy and delete operations are not allowed when the file and directory are hidden in controller-mode.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Reset Controller Mode Configuration

If you use request platform software sdwan config reset  or request platform software sdwan software reset  commands to bring the device back to controller-mode day-zero configuration, the device performs one of the following actions:

* Performs mode discovery. For more information on mode discovery, see [Mode Discovery with Plug and Play Onboarding](#mode-discovery-with-pnp-onboarding).
* Uses the appropriate configuration file to perform bootstrap. For more information on the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN bootstrap configuration file, see [Creating a Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Bootstrap Configuration File](#creating-a-cisco-sd-wan-bootstrap-configuration-file).

To erase the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN configuration of the current active image, use the following CLI:

```
Device# request platform software sdwan config reset
%WARNING: Bootstrap file doesn't exist and absence of it can cause loss of connectivity to the controller.
For saving bootstrap config, use:
request platform software sdwan bootstrap-config save
Proceed to reset anyway? [confirm]
Backup of running config is saved under /bootflash/sdwan/backup.cfg
WARNING: Reload is required for config-reset to become effective.
```

| **Note** | ---   The warning listed in the above configuration is visible only on Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.3.1a and later images.   --- |
| --- | --- |

For the changes to take effect, you must reload the router after running the CLI. Running this CLI ensures the configuration
for the currently installed version is wiped along with crypto keys and the device enters the day zero workflow after the
reload.

If the device is not set up to use PnP for onboarding, then it reads the configuration file in the bootflash and uses the
configuration information to come up on the network. If the device is setup to use PnP onboarding, then after reload, the
PnP discovery will start again.

| **Note** | ---   In the case of public clouds, just like a fresh install, additional bootstrap configuration is provisioned that allows you to login to the instance.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   In public cloud and NFVIS environments, ensure that a latest day-zero bootstrap configuration file (exported from Cisco SD-WAN Manager) is available in a supported location and following standard file naming conventions (example: bootflash:/ciscosdwan\_cloud\_init.cfg file), before the configuration reset operation is performed.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Warning** | ---   Failure to follow save the bootstrap file in these environments cause loss of virtual machine connectivity.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Configuration Reset

When you do a configuration reset, the device performs the following:

* Erases only the configuration of the current running image.
* Erases the certificates.
* Reboots the router with the same image. At this point, the device repeats Day-0 boot up.

### Software Reset

When you do a software reset, the device performs the following:

* Erases all SD-WAN metadata saved in the bootflash:/sdwan folder including certificates.
* Erases configuration of all the images (running as well as previously activated).
* Removes all image files except the one marked as default.
* Reboots the router with the default version image. At this point, the device repeats Day-0 boot up.

## Mode Switching: Additional Information

* [Configuration Persistence During Mode Switch](#configuration-persistence-during-mode-switch)

### Configuration Persistence During Mode Switch

Table 8.

| Current Configuration Mode | Mode Switched to | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Autonomous | Controller | Contents of NVRAM and the startup configuration are erased. Configuration is not be restored. Device is reverted to Day zero configuration. Previous running configuration is stored in bootflash.   | **Note** | When you switch from autonomous mode to controller mode, and switch back to autonomous mode, the Cisco IOS XE configuration is not restored because the startup configuration is empty. You have to manually restore configuration from the backup. | | --- | --- | |
| Controller | Autonomous | CDB contents are erased (for subsequent mode switches) and Cisco IOS configuration are not restored (as startup configuration is empty). You have to manually restore configuration from the backup. |

## Change the Console Port Access After Installation, in Controller Mode

### Before You Begin

Before beginning this procedure, ensure that you have access to the Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco Catalyst 8000V router through the currently configured console access method.

### Change the Console Port Access

This procedure changes the method for connecting to the console to access a Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco Catalyst 8000V software device.

The image used for deploying the Cisco CSR1000V or Cisco Catalyst 8000V software determines the default type of console access to use, which can be virtual or serial.

The procedure includes changing the mode from controller to autonomous, and then back to controller, which is required for
operation with Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN. These mode changes cause the device to reload.

Perform the following steps to change the console port access.

1. In EXEC mode, enter enable  to enter privileged EXEC mode.

   ```
   Router> enable
   ```
2. Disable controller mode. Enter the following command and follow the prompts to complete the command.

   ```
   Device# controller-mode disable
   ```

   | **Note** | ---   This reboots the device in autonomous mode.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
3. After the device restarts, enter enable  to enter privileged EXEC mode.

   ```
   Router> enable
   ```
4. Enter global configuration mode.

   ```
   Device# configure terminal
   ```
5. Use one of the following options to configure the type of access:

   * virtual: This option specifies that the device is accessed through the hypervisor virtual VGA console.

     ```
     Device(config)# platform console virtual
     ```
   * serial: This option specifies that the device is accessed through the serial port on the virtual machine (VM).

     | **Note** | ---  + Use this option only if your hypervisor supports serial port console access. + If the device configuration is stored as a Cisco SD-WAN Manager device template and is attached to the device using Cisco SD-WAN Manager, enter the command   ```   Device(config)# platform console serial   ```   to the CLI add-on feature template. For more information on CLI Add-On Feature Templates see, [​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Systems and Interfaces Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/system-interface/ios-xe-17/systems-interfaces-book-xe-sdwan/cli-add-on-feature-template.html). This helps in avoiding Cisco SD-WAN Manager removing the serial port when the device template is attached to the device.  --- |
     | --- | --- |

     ```
     Device(config)# platform console serial
     ```
   * auto: (This option has been deprecated and is not recommended.) This option specifies that the device console is detected
     automatically. This is the default setting during the initial installation boot process. For additional information, see [Booting the Cisco CSR 1000v as the VM](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/csr1000/software/configuration/b_CSR1000v_Configuration_Guide/b_CSR1000v_Configuration_Guide_chapter_0111.html#task_1205079).
6. Exit configuration mode.

   ```
   Device(config)# end
   ```
7. Save the configuration.

   ```
   Device# write memory
   ```
8. Copy the running configuration to the startup configuration.

   ```
   Device# copy system:running-config nvram:startup-config
   ```
9. Change the device back to controller mode. Enter the following command and follow the prompts to complete the command.

   ```
   Device# controller-mode enable
   ```

   | **Note** | ---   This step reboots the device in controller mode.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

Use the following procedures to upgrade your device to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r or later images.

| **Note** | ---   Do not delete the existing image to ensure that you have a rollback option.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---  If an upgrade fails, do not attempt to reactivate the new software image. Instead, remove the new software image, identify and correct any configuration settings that might have caused the failure, and try the upgrade procedure again. If the issue persists, contact Cisco for assistance.  --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   When upgrading to Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.4.1a from Cisco IOS XE Releases 17.3.1a or earlier, we recommend that you do not make any changes to the device configuration using CLI, while a feature template is detached. Starting Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.4.1a, we use Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN assisted upgrades. In this upgrade procedure, Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN saves the device configuration before the upgrade. If the configuration on the device, that is modified using CLI is not same as on Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, then the device has inconsistent configuration after the upgrade.  For example, if you configure the BGP AS number of a device to a different value using CLI, the device can have inconsistent configuration and the upgrade fails. If the upgrade is performed when the device is in CLI mode, then you must revert the BGP AS number to the original value and then upgrade the device. Therefore, we recommend that you upgrade the device using Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN.   --- |
| --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.5.1a, if you are upgrading the firmware for a device on which the primary tunnel interface is a cellular interface and the backup tunnel interface is a gigabit interface, use the gigabit interface as the primary interface for the firmware upgrade.  For information about configuring the priority of a tunnel interface, see the vmanage-connection-preference command in *​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Command Reference*. An interface that is configured with a higher preference value has a higher priority.   --- |
| --- | --- |

* [Upgrade Using Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN](#upgrade-using-cisco-vmanage)
* [Upgrade Using CLI](#upgrade-using-cli)

### Upgrade Using Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN

We recommend using Cisco SD-WAN Manager to upgrade. This keeps devices and the controller synchronized.

1. Use the Cisco SD-WAN Manager
   [upgrade and activate](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/Monitor-And-Maintain/monitor-maintain-book/maintain.html#c-Software_Upgrade-12330) procedure described in the *​Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Monitor and Maintain* guide.

### Upgrade Using CLI

We recommend using Cisco SD-WAN Manager to upgrade. This keeps devices and the controller synchronized. If it is necessary to upgrade using the CLI, use the following
steps.

#### Back Up Configuration Files

Use these following steps to make configuration file copies before performing the manual upgrade process. Without these steps,
the router will lose its configuration during the upgrade.

| **Note** | ---   If the deployment is on a public cloud service, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), failure to save the configuration before upgrading manually can cause an unrecoverable loss of connectivity with the device. In contrast to a hardware device, there may be no way to gain any type of console access to the virtual router.   --- |
| --- | --- |

1. Use the following command to make a backup copy of the Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN configuration:

   ```
   show running-config | redirect bootflash:/sdwan/ios.cli
   ```
2. Use the following command to make a backup copy of the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN running configuration:

   ```
   show sdwan running-config | redirect bootflash:/sdwan/sdwan.cli
   ```

#### Upgrade Procedure

1. Download the Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2 image for your device from [https://software.cisco.com](https://software.cisco.com/download/home/286320954)
2. Upload the image to the device.
3. Install the new software. Example:

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software install bootflash:/isr4300-universalk9.17.2.1.SPA.bin
   ```
4. Activate the software. The device reloads when the activation is complete. Example:

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software activate 17.2.01r.9.3
   ```
5. Verify that the software is activated.

   ```
   Device# show sdwan software

   VERSION      ACTIVE DEFAULT PREVIOUS CONFIRMED TIMESTAMP
   --------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   16.12.1d.0.48 false  true   true     auto     2020-03-04T10:43:45-00:00
   17.2.01r.9.3   true  false  false    user     2020-03-04T11:15:20-00:00

   Total Space:388M Used Space:100M Available Space:285M
   ```
6. (Optional) To ensure that the new version is preserved if software reset required, use the following command. Example:
   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software set-default 17.2.01r.9.3
   ```
7. Verify the upgrade using request platform software sdwan software upgrade-confirm .

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software upgrade-confirm
   ```

   | **Note** | ---   From 17.6.1 release, you cannot perform another install, activate or deactivate operation for an image or a Software Maintenance Update (SMU), when the upgrade-confirm function is pending for an existing operation.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

| **Note** | ---   In controller mode, use the config-transaction  command to enter global configuration mode. The configuration terminal  command is not supported in Controller mode.   --- |
| --- | --- |

To downgrade a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device to an earlier software image that is currently installed on the device using the CLI, perform the following steps:

1. Display the currently installed images.

   ```
   Device# show sdwan software

   Example:
   VERSION          ACTIVE  DEFAULT  PREVIOUS  CONFIRMED  TIMESTAMP
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   16.10.400.0.0    false   true     true      auto       2019-11-20T04:40:05-00:00
   17.3.1.0.102822  true    false    false     auto       2020-07-31T11:01:22-00:00
   ```
2. Activate the image. This resets the device, deleting any existing configuration. The device starts in day zero configuration.

   ```
   Device# request platform software software activate desired-build
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   Device# request platform software software activate 16.10.400.0.0
   ```

### Downgrade a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Device to an Older Software Image

To download an earlier software image and downgrade a Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN device to an earlier software image using the CLI, perform the following steps:

1. Display the currently installed images.

   ```
   Device# show sdwan software

   Example:
   VERSION          ACTIVE  DEFAULT  PREVIOUS  CONFIRMED  TIMESTAMP
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   16.10.400.0.0    false   true     true      auto       2019-11-20T04:40:05-00:00
   17.3.1.0.102822  true    false    false     auto       2020-07-31T11:01:22-00:00
   ```
2. If necessary, remove an existing software image to provide space for loading a new software image.

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software remove previous-installed-build
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software remove 16.10.400.0.0
   ```
3. Download the software image for the downgrade and copy it to the device bootflash.
4. Install the downloaded image.

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software install bootflash:/desired-build
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software install bootflash:/isr1100be-universalk9.17.02.01a.SPA.bin
   ```
5. Display the currently installed images, which now include the new image.

   ```
   Device# show sdwan software
   VERSION          ACTIVE  DEFAULT  PREVIOUS  CONFIRMED  TIMESTAMP
   ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------
   17.02.01a.0.211  false    true     true      auto       2020-03-30T09:34:04-00:00
   ```
6. Activate the new image. This resets the device, deleting any existing configuration. The device starts in day zero configuration.

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software activate desired-build clean
   ```

   Example:

   ```
   Device# request platform software sdwan software 17.02.01a.0.211 clean
   ```

### Downgrade Scenarios for Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.x

Table 12. Configuration Persistence in Downgrade Scenarios

| Existing Installation (image) | Downgrade to (image) | Behavior |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r(universalk9) in controller mode | Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Release 16.12 and earlier (ucmk9) | Device boots up with ucmk9 image and configuration is restored if the uckm9 image was previously installed on the device.  Downgrading to a fresh install of old image versions brings the device to Day 0 configuration. To proceed, use the `clean` option at activation. |
| Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN Release 17.2.1r (universalk9) in autonomous mode | Cisco IOS XE Release 17.1.1 and earlier (universalk9) | Device boots up with universalk9 image and configuration is restored. |

| **Note** | ---  * Downgrading directly from controller mode to Cisco IOS XE Amsterdam Release 17.1.x or earlier universalk9 or other non Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN images is not supported. To downgrade from controller mode to earlier IOS XE images, switch to autonomous mode and follow   the downgrade process. * Downgrading directly from autonomous mode to Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN 16.12 or earlier ucmk9 SD-WAN images is not supported. To   downgrade from autonomous mode to earlier Cisco IOS XE Catalyst SD-WAN images, switch to controller mode and follow the downgrade process.  --- |

   hardware
   throughput
   crypto
   crypto-value .
4. Save the configuration using write
   memory  in privileged EXEC mode.
5. Reload the device and verify that the new crypto throughput value is applied using the show platform hardware throughput crypto  command.

### Restore Smart License Reservation

1. Enable the reservation mode using the license smart reservation
    command in global configuration mode.
2. Set the required crypto throughput using platform hardware throughput crypto
   crypto-value .
3. Save the configuration using write memory .
4. Reload the device and verify that the new crypto throughput value is applied using the show platform hardware throughput crypto  command.

## Onboard Cisco Catalyst 8000V Edge Software Hosted by a Cloud Service, Using PAYG Licensing

To onboard a Cisco Catalyst 8000V platform hosted by a cloud service, using pay as you go (PAYG) licensing, perform these steps.

You can also use Cisco Cloud onRamp for Multi-Cloud to onboard a Cisco Catalyst 8000V platform using PAYG licensing. For information to integrate public cloud infrastructure into the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN fabric, see [Cloud OnRamp Configuration Guide, Cisco IOS XE Release 17.x](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/cloudonramp/ios-xe-17/cloud-onramp-book-xe/cloud-onramp-multi-cloud.html).

| **Note** | ---   This procedure is applicable to Cisco Catalyst 8000V hosted by Amazon Web Services (AWS).   --- |
| --- | --- |

1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Devices, and click Add PAYG WAN Edges.
2. In the Add PAYG WAN Edges dialog box, enter the number of PAYG devices to onboard into Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN, select the Validate check box, and click Add.

   The Task View page opens, showing the progress as Cisco SD-WAN Manager creates logical devices.

   | **Note** | ---   Validating causes Cisco SD-WAN Manager to publish the list of devices to the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Validator and Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Controller controllers in the network.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
3. After the Task View page shows the logical devices have been created successfully, choose Configuration > Devices to view the new logical devices on the Devices page.

   | **Note** | ---   The Chassis Number column shows the unique identifier for each logical device.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
4. For the logical devices that you have created, click … and choose Generate Bootstrap Configuration.
5. (Optional) Attach a device template to the logical devices that you have created.
6. In the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box, click Cloud-Init and then click OK.

   The Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box shows the content of the bootstrap configuration, which includes the UUID of the logical device, and includes
   the configuration details provided by the device template if you have attached one.

   | **Note** | ---   The UUID corresponds to the identifier in the Chassis Number column in the Devices table.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
7. There are different methods for loading the bootstrap configuration onto a C8000V instance on a cloud service. The method
   you use depends on the cloud service. We recommend to click Download in the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box to save a copy of the bootstrap configuration.
8. In the cloud services portal, create a PAYG instance of the Cisco Catalyst 8000V. When configuring the instance, use the bootstrap configuration that you created in Cisco SD-WAN Manager. The details of how to load the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN bootstrap configuration onto the instance are specific to the cloud services provider.

   | **Note** | ---   On AWS, the workflow for bringing up an instance includes a user data step that enables loading the bootstrap configuration.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
9. On the cloud service platform, start the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance using the bootstrap configuration from an earlier step.

   When the Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance boots up, it joins the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN overlay automatically. In Cisco SD-WAN Manager, on the Devices page, this Cisco Catalyst 8000V instance shows a green medal icon in the State column and In Sync in the Device Status column.

   | **Note** | ---   On the Devices page, for logical devices that have not joined the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN overlay, the State column shows a dotted-circle icon.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

## Bootstrap Process for Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN Cloud-Hosted Devices

### Before You Begin

The device template provides the configuration details that enable the device to connect to Cisco SD-WAN Manager.

If you create a logical device and then generate a bootstrap configuration without first attaching a device template, the
resulting file will include a minimal configuration. If you attach a device template to the logical device before generating
the bootstrap configuration, the resulting file will include a more complete configuration, which can be helpful in enabling
the device to connect to the Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN overlay. We recommend that you attach a device template to the logical device before creating the bootstrap configuration.

This procedure is useful when onboarding a software device, such as the Cisco Catalyst 8000V, to a private cloud, such as
KVM, ESXi, or OpenStack.

### Bootstrap Process for Cisco SD-WAN Cloud-Hosted Devices

1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Configuration > Devices.
2. For the logical device (includes the UUID) that you are using for a new cloud-hosted instance, click … and choose Generate Bootstrap Configuration.
3. In the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box, choose Cloud-Init and click OK. The Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box displays the bootstrap configuration, including the OTP token for the license, Cisco SD-WAN Validator address, UUID, and organization information.

   | **Note** | ---   The UUID corresponds to the identifier in the Chassis Number column in the Devices table.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

   | **Note** | ---   Ensure that the bootstrap configuration does not include more interfaces than the virtual device instance has in the cloud environment.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
4. There are different methods for loading the bootstrap configuration onto a device instance on a cloud service. The method
   you use depends on the cloud service. We recommend that you click Download in the Generate Bootstrap Configuration dialog box to save a copy of the bootstrap configuration.

   You can use the bootstrap configuration when setting up a device instance in the cloud service. The configuration enables
   the device instance to connect to Cisco Catalyst SD-WAN.

For information about onboarding a Cisco Catalyst 8000V in a private cloud, see the following:

Troubleshooting

## Troubleshooting Software Installation

### Router Loads the Previous Software Version After Booting

* [Router Loads the Previous Software Version After Booting](#router-loads-prev-ver)

### Router Loads the Previous Software Version After Booting

#### Problem

A router starts up using the previously installed software version.

#### Conditions

A router using Cisco IOS XE has two or more software versions installed.

#### Possible Causes

If the router begins booting up, and power cycles during the bootup, it may reboot using the previously installed software
version.

| **Note** | ---   Cisco IOS XE devices have a mechanism that preserves the previously installed software version. As a safeguard against getting stuck during bootup with a corrupted software image, a device can fall back to the previously installed software version. This fallback can also occur if the device experiences a power cycle during bootup. In this case (power cycle during bootup), you can reboot the device to load the latest software.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Solutions

1. Check the active and inactive system software versions for a device using one of the following procedures:

   * Cisco SD-WAN Manager procedure:

     1. From the Cisco SD-WAN Manager menu, choose Monitor > Devices.
     2. Click a device name in the Hostname column.
     3. In the left pane, click Real Time.
     4. In the Device Options field, enter Software Versions.

        A table displays the installed software versions and indicates which version is active.
   * CLI procedure:

     1. Execute the show sdwan software command in privileged EXEC mode to view the current active software version and the previous version.
     2. Execute the show version command on the device, in privileged EXEC mode.

        If the device is using the latest installed software version, the command output shows bootflash:packages.conf.

        If the device is using the previous software version, the command output shows bootflash:prev\_packages.conf.
2. Reboot the device and check the loaded system software again.
3. If the device boots again with the previous software version (bootflash:prev\_packages.conf), contact Cisco TAC for assistance.

| Check Your Cisco Software  Use the Cisco Software Checker to search for Cisco Security Advisories that apply to specific software releases of the following products: Cisco ASA, FMC, FTD, FXOS, IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS and NX-OS in ACI Mode. To use the tool, select a product, platform (as required) and one or more releases, enter the output of the show version command, or upload a text file that lists specific releases. Then narrow the check to certain advisories, if desired. The availability of security fixes after the End of Sale is defined in the product's End-of-Sale announcement, as explained in the [Cisco End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Additional information about Cisco software updates, vulnerability rating and scoring is available in the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). This tool does not provide information about Cisco IOS XR Software or interim software builds. Also note that for Cisco ASA, FMC, FTD and FXOS Software, the tool only contains vulnerability information for Cisco Security Advisories first published from January, 2022 onward, and for NX-OS Software and NX-OS Software in ACI Mode from July, 2019 onward. |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |

| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

This vulnerability occurs because the default configuration is applied for console authentication and authorization. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by connecting to the console port and authenticating as a read-only user. A successful exploit could allow a user with read-only permissions to access administrative privileges.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-sdwan-esc-rSNVvTf9>  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected universal Cisco IOS XE Software earlier than the first fixed release if it was running in Controller mode. Cisco IOS XE Software releases earlier than Release 17.2.1r are not affected by this vulnerability because they do not include the SD-WAN feature. For additional information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  At the time of publication, this vulnerability affected all *standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software* releases earlier than the first fixed release  **Note:** The standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN release images are separate from the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases. The SD-WAN feature set was first integrated into the universal Cisco IOS XE Software releases starting with IOS XE Software Release 17.2.1r. For additional information, see the [Install and Upgrade Cisco IOS XE Release 17.2.1r and Later](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/routers/sdwan/configuration/sdwan-xe-gs-book/install-upgrade-17-2-later.html) chapter of the *Cisco SD-WAN Getting Started Guide*.  For additional information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory.  See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information. Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS Software   + IOS XE Software in autonomous mode   + IOS XR Software   + NX-OS Software   + SD-WAN vBond Orchestrator Software   + SD-WAN vEdge Routers   + SD-WAN vManage Software   + SD-WAN vSmart Controller Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  Fixed Software  * When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**:     By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search. Standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software At the time of publication, standalone Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN Software releases 16.12(5) and later contained the fix for this vulnerability.  See the Details section in the bug ID(s) at the top of this advisory for the most complete and current information.
