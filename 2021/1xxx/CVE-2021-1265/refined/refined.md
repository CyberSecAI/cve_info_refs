Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1265:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that configuration archive files in Cisco DNA Center are stored in clear text. These files can be accessed through various API calls.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Clear Text Storage:** Sensitive configuration data is stored without encryption.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows unauthorized access to sensitive information by exposing the full running configurations of managed devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Confidentiality Breach:** An attacker can gain access to the complete, unmasked running configurations of managed devices. This may expose sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, network topology, and security policies, potentially leading to further malicious activities.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Although the attacker needs to have some level of authenticated access, the vulnerability can enable them to bypass access restrictions, and therefore, obtain higher privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **API Calls:** The vulnerability is exploited by making API calls to the affected system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must have some level of authenticated access to Cisco DNA Center.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Cisco DNA Center system.
- **API knowledge:** The attacker needs to know how to exploit the vulnerable API endpoints to retrieve the configuration files.

**Additional Details:**
- **Affected Products:** Cisco DNA Center Software releases prior to 2.1.1.0 are vulnerable.
- **Fixed Software:** The vulnerability is fixed in Cisco DNA Center Software releases 2.1.1.0, 2.1.2.0, 2.1.2.3, 2.1.2.4 and later.
- **Workarounds:** No workarounds are available. Customers must upgrade to a fixed release to mitigate the vulnerability.
- **CVSS Score:**  Base score of 7.7 (High Severity) with vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N
