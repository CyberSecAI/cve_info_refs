  "CVE-2021-1579": {
    "description": "A vulnerability in an API endpoint of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco Cloud Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (Cloud APIC) could allow an authenticated, remote attacker with *Administrator* *read-only* credentials to elevate privileges on an affected system. This vulnerability is due to an insufficient role-based access control (RBAC). An attacker with *Administrator* *read-only* credentials could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific API request using an app with admin *write* credentials. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to elevate privileges to *Administrator* with *write* privileges on the affected device.",
