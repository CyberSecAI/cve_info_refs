Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-1073:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the login flow of NVIDIA GeForce Experience when a user attempts to log in using a browser. If other web pages are simultaneously loaded in other tabs of the same browser, these pages can gain access to the user's login session token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper session management, specifically regarding the handling of user login tokens within the browser environment.
- Lack of isolation between the GeForce Experience login process and other browser tabs.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-  **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized access to the user's login session token.
-  **Data Tampering:** The attacker can potentially alter the targeted userâ€™s data.
- **Denial of Service:** The attacker can potentially cause data loss.
- **Account Compromise:** The user's account can be compromised leading to data access, alteration, or loss.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based (`AV:N`).
- It requires a user to be logged in via the browser within the NVIDIA GeForce Experience.
- The attack requires user interaction (`UI:R`).
- The attack is carried out by tricking a user to load a malicious website simultaneously to logging into GeForce Experience.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need any privileges (`PR:N`).
- The attacker needs to trick the user into visiting the malicious site while attempting to log in to GeForce Experience.
- The attacker has to exploit a vulnerability in the browser context where the session tokens are exposed.
