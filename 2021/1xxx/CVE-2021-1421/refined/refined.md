Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1421:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content directly relates to **CVE-2021-1421**, which is identified as a command injection vulnerability in Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS). This is confirmed by the inclusion of the CVE ID within the security advisory and the relevant text describing the vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **insufficient validation of user-supplied input** within a specific configuration command within Cisco NFVIS.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection flaw. Malicious input injected into the vulnerable configuration command can lead to the execution of arbitrary OS commands.
*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization and validation of user-provided input before being used by the system.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system (OS).
*   **Root Privileges:** The injected commands are executed with root privileges.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system, including the ability to steal data, modify the system, or disrupt services.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack vector is described as a "local attacker," indicating that the attacker needs to have some form of local access to the affected device.
*  **Restricted CLI:** The attacker needs to be authenticated into the restricted CLI.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must be an authenticated user within the restricted CLI.
*   **Non-Privileged Account:** The attacker is described as a "non-privileged attacker", meaning they can perform this attack from an account that is not an administrator.
*   **Access to Configuration Command:** The attacker needs to have access to the specific configuration command that is vulnerable to command injection.

**Summary of Information from the Documents:**

*   **Affected Product:** Cisco Enterprise NFV Infrastructure Software (NFVIS) versions prior to 4.5.1.
*   **Fixed Version:** Cisco has released free software updates to address the vulnerability in NFVIS 4.5.1 and later.
