*   **Attack vector:** Exploitation of a null pointer dereference via a malformed or unexpected Bluetooth interaction with the affected device.
*   **Attacker capabilities:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable Bluetooth component. This likely means being in Bluetooth range and initiating communication.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-1022 is a moderate severity denial-of-service vulnerability affecting Bluetooth on Android systems. The vulnerability is caused by a null pointer dereference when the callback variable (`cb`) is null in the `btif_hf_client` module. An attacker within Bluetooth range can potentially trigger this vulnerability, causing a device to crash. The fix involves preventing the dereference when the pointer is null.
