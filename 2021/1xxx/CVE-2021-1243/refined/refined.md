  "CVE-2021-1243": {
    "Metadata": {
      "CWE": "CWE-284",
      "CVSS": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N",
      "Description": "A vulnerability in the Local Packet Transport Services (LPTS) programming of the SNMP with the management plane protection feature of Cisco IOS XR Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to allow connections despite the management plane protection that is configured to deny access to the SNMP server of an affected device.",
      "Version": "1.1",
      "First Published": "2021-02-03T16:00:00+00:00",
      "Last Updated": "2021-02-08T20:12:08+00:00"
    },
    "Vulnerability Details": {
      "Root Cause": "Incorrect LPTS programming when using SNMP with management plane protection.",
       "Weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect management plane protection for SNMP",
          "LPTS bindings do not reflect management plane protection configuration after SNMP process restart"
        ],
        "Impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker can connect to the device on the configured SNMP ports, bypassing the intended management plane protection. However, valid SNMP credentials are still required to execute requests.",
      "Attack Vectors": [
        "Remote network connection using SNMP"
      ],
      "Required Capabilities": [
        "Network connectivity to the affected device on configured SNMP ports"
      ]
    },
    "Affected Products": {
      "Cisco IOS XR Software": "Releases later than 6.1.1 and earlier than 6.6.4, 6.7.2, 7.0.2, 7.0.12, 7.1.1, and 7.2.1 are affected. Specifically, devices are vulnerable if configured with SNMPv2 or SNMPv3, using management plane protection with the Out-of-Band Management Interface, and have a VRF configured."
    },
    "Workarounds": [
      "Remove and reapply the SNMP management plane protection configuration to ensure correct LPTS entry programming, however, this is temporary and the vulnerability will reappear upon SNMP process restart.",
       "Apply an access control list (ACL) directly to the SNMP configuration"
    ],
   "Fix Information": {
        "Fixed Releases": "Cisco IOS XR Software releases 6.6.4, 6.7.2, 7.0.2, 7.0.12, 7.1.1, and 7.2.1 and later contain the fix.  Changes made by Cisco bug ID CSCvr95904 prevent this vulnerability from being exploited. The first fix is a combination of the first fix from both CSCvr95904 and CSCvt93184.",
        "Software Maintenance Upgrades (SMUs)": "SMUs are available for specific releases and platforms including 6.4.2 on ASR9K-PX and CRS-PX, and 6.6.3 on NCS5500"
     },
   "Additional Information": {
        "Exploitation and Public Announcements": "The Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.",
        "Source": "This vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case."
