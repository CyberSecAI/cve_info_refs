Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1010:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks within the `get/setMimeGroup` functions related to package ownership. Specifically, the package name and calling UID were not verified to ensure they originated from the same application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The lack of proper validation could potentially allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to information related to MIME groups that they shouldn't be able to access.
- **Insecure Permissions:** The vulnerability arises from missing or incomplete permission checks in the `get/setMimeGroup` functions, which could be exploited to gain unintended access to system resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform the following actions:
- Leak potentially sensitive information about MIME group configurations.
- Modify MIME group settings without proper authorization.
- Impersonate another application to obtain MIME group information or modify settings

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the `get/setMimeGroup` functions by invoking them with a crafted request using a different package name and UID than the target application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to have an application installed on the target device.
- They must be able to call the vulnerable methods from their malicious app.
- No special permissions appear to be needed.

**Additional Details:**
- The fix involves combining the two `IllegalArgumentException` checks in `getSingingKeySet` to mitigate potential information leakage.
- The fix also includes enforcing ownership rights checks within the `get/setMimeGroup` functions to ensure that the package name and calling UID originate from the same application.
- The implementation was moved to internal variants to enhance security.
- The commit message mentions guarding `PackageSettings` with `synchronized()` for thread safety.
