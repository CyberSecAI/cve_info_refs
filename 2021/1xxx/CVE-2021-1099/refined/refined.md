Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-1099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA vGPU software, specifically within the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin).
- It's caused by a stack-based buffer overflow. An attacker can manipulate input to trigger this overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow
- Improper input validation

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information disclosure
- Data tampering
- Denial of service
- The ability to place a customized ROP (Return-Oriented Programming) gadget on the stack, which could allow the attacker to execute arbitrary code

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through a request from a guest OS to the vGPU plugin.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have a malicious guest VM that can interact with the vGPU plugin.
- Low privileges are required, but the attack has "High" complexity (AC:H).
