Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-1064:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA vGPU manager's vGPU plugin. It involves obtaining a value from an untrusted source, converting this value to a pointer, and then dereferencing that pointer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use of Untrusted Input:** The core issue is that the plugin receives a value from a source it does not trust.
- **Unvalidated Pointer Dereference:** The program blindly converts the untrusted input into a pointer and dereferences it without validation. This is a classic case of an arbitrary pointer dereference.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  Reading arbitrary memory locations could expose sensitive data.
- **Denial of Service:** Dereferencing invalid memory can cause the program to crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to the system is required.
- **Access to vGPU Plugin:**  The attacker must be able to interact with the vulnerable vGPU plugin component.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User:**  A local user account is needed.
- **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require user interaction.
- **Access to vGPU Plugin:** The attacker needs to be able to send malformed data to the vGPU plugin such that an attacker-controlled value is used as a pointer.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is part of a larger set of security issues addressed in the January 2021 NVIDIA security bulletin.
- The provided document references CVSS v3.1 score of 7.8, and includes vector details: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H. This indicates it is a high severity issue.
- The vulnerability affects multiple operating systems (Citrix Hypervisor, VMware vSphere, Red Hat Enterprise Linux KVM, Nutanix AHV) using NVIDIA vGPU software.
- It is stated that the vGPU plugin is affected, not the guest driver in this case.
