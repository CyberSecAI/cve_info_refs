Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1372:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of shared memory by the Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App and Webex Productivity Tools for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Unsafe Shared Memory Usage:** The applications improperly handle shared memory, allowing other processes to potentially access it.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The shared memory contains sensitive information, such as usernames, meeting details, and authentication tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Sensitive Data Exposure:** An attacker can potentially retrieve sensitive information from the shared memory.
*   **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation could lead to an attacker obtaining user credentials and potentially gaining unauthorized access to Webex meetings and accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Local System:** The attacker must have access to the local Windows system where the vulnerable software is installed.
*   **Shared Memory Access:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by running a malicious application designed to read the shared memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Local User Account:** The attacker requires a valid user account on the Microsoft Windows end-user system.
*   **Post-Authentication:** The attacker must log into the system *after* another user has already authenticated with Webex on the same system. This is because the vulnerability is related to how shared memory is used between different sessions and users.

**Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Cisco Webex Meetings Desktop App and Webex Productivity Tools on Windows before versions 40.6 and 40.10. It also impacts versions included with Cisco Webex Meeting Server releases prior to 4.0MR3 SP4.
*  **Not Affected:**  Apple Mac OS X and Linux versions of these products are not affected by this vulnerability.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading to the fixed software versions.
*   **Internal Discovery:** The vulnerability was found during internal security testing by Cisco.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.5 (Medium severity).
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-202 (Information Exposure).

In summary, CVE-2021-1372 is a medium severity vulnerability in Cisco Webex products on Windows that could lead to information disclosure. A local attacker who logs into the system after a valid user has authenticated with Webex can exploit the vulnerability by reading shared memory to retrieve sensitive user data. Upgrading the affected software is the only fix.
