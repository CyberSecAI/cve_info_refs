Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1499:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to a missing authentication mechanism for the file upload function in the web-based management interface of the Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Authentication:** The core issue is the lack of authentication checks for the file upload functionality, which allows unauthenticated users to interact with the upload process.
- **Insecure File Upload:** The affected system allows file uploads without proper authorization.

- **HTTP Request:** The attack is conducted by sending a specific HTTP request to the affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Access:** The attacker requires network access to the web-based management interface of the Cisco HyperFlex HX Data Platform.
- **Unauthenticated:** The attacker does not need any authentication credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **HTTP knowledge:** The attacker must be able to craft an HTTP request to trigger the vulnerability.
