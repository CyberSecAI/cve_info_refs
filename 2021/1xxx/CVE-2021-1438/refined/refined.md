Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1438:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from improper input validation and authorization of specific commands that a user can execute within the Cisco Wide Area Application Services (WAAS) CLI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Input Validation:** The system fails to properly validate the input provided through the CLI, allowing for the execution of commands that should be restricted.
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The system does not adequately check the user's privileges before executing commands, allowing an authenticated local user to bypass intended access restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can read arbitrary files on the affected device that they normally would not have permission to access.
- This constitutes an information disclosure vulnerability, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the affected device's CLI.
- **CLI Interaction:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by issuing a specific set of commands via the CLI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to authenticate to the affected device.
- The attacker needs to be a local user, meaning they must be able to access the device's CLI directly.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Cisco Wide Area Application Services releases 6.4.5a and earlier.
- The fix is available in Cisco Wide Area Application Services releases 6.4.5c and later.
- No workarounds are available for this vulnerability.
- This vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- The CVSS base score for the vulnerability is 5.5, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N.
- There are no known public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability at the time of the advisory publication.
