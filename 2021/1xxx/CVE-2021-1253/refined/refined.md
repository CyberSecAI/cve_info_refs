Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1253:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation within the web-based management interface of Cisco Data Center Network Manager (DCNM).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input by the web interface, specifically when handling data inserted into specific fields. This allows for the injection of malicious code. The vulnerability is a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
A successful exploit could allow a remote attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected user's browser. This could lead to:
    * Access to sensitive, browser-based information, such as cookies or session tokens.
    * Manipulation of the web interface and potential unauthorized actions within the application.
    * Further exploitation of the user's browser or system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is remote via the network. An attacker could insert malicious data into specific input fields within the Cisco DCNM web-based management interface. This injected code is stored and executed when a user accesses the affected page or feature in the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    * The attacker needs to be authenticated as a "network-operator" to access the vulnerable parts of the interface.
    * The attacker must be able to insert malicious data into the DCNM interface.
    * User interaction is required for the malicious script to execute within the target user's browser. Specifically, the victim needs to access the page where the attacker's injected script is stored.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability is categorized as a persistent cross-site scripting (XSS).
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.9.
*   There are no workarounds available to mitigate the risk.
*   The fix was introduced in Cisco DCNM release 11.5(1) and later.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerabilities.
*   Cisco Bug IDs associated with this vulnerability are CSCvv07930 and CSCvv00646.

This analysis provides more detail than the official CVE description, specifically by clarifying that the XSS is persistent and requires authentication to insert the malicious data, although the user who triggers the exploit does not need to be the same user.
