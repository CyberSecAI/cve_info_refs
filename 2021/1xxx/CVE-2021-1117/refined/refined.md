Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-1117:

*   **Root Cause:** Improper input validation within the `nvlddmkm.sys` kernel mode layer, specifically in the handler for DxgkDdiEscape.
*   **Vulnerability:** The vulnerability lies in the inadequate validation of input passed to the DxgkDdiEscape handler in the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver. This handler is part of the kernel mode layer.
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial of service (DoS).
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
    *   **Unprivileged Access:** The attacker doesn't need elevated privileges and can be an unprivileged user of the system.
    *   **Specific Configuration:** The attack requires a specific configuration, implying that not all systems are equally vulnerable, and specific setup might be needed.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker must be able to trigger the DxgkDdiEscape handler in a way that exposes the input validation flaw.

**Additional Details:**

* The affected software is the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows.
* The vulnerable component is the `nvlddmkm.sys` driver.
* The document specifies that the vulnerability is present in multiple driver branches (R495, R470, R460, R390 for Windows) and all versions prior to the listed updated versions.
* It also affects vGPU software (guest driver) on Windows, specifically versions prior to 13.1, 12.4, 11.6, and 8.9.
* The CVSS vector is `AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H`, which translates to:
    *   **AV:L (Attack Vector: Local):** The attack requires the attacker to have local access to the target system.
    *   **AC:H (Attack Complexity: High):** Exploiting the vulnerability is complex and may require specific conditions.
    *  **PR:L (Privileges Required: Low):** The attacker needs low-level privileges to carry out the attack.
    *   **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
    *   **S:U (Scope: Unchanged):** The vulnerability affects only the component where the vulnerability exists and not beyond.
    *   **C:N (Confidentiality: None):** There is no impact on data confidentiality.
    *   **I:N (Integrity: None):** There is no impact on data integrity.
    *   **A:H (Availability: High):** The vulnerability has a high impact on the availability of the affected system.
