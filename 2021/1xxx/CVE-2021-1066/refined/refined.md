Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-1066:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA vGPU manager, specifically in the vGPU plugin. The core issue is a lack of validation for input data.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient input validation. Specifically, the input data provided to the vGPU plugin is not properly checked or validated. This allows for malformed or malicious data to be processed by the plugin.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unexpected resource consumption which can lead to denial of service. By sending specific unvalidated data the attacker can force the consumption of excessive resources, resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack is local, and no user interaction is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system running the vulnerable NVIDIA vGPU manager. This could include a malicious user on the host or a malicious guest OS in a virtualized environment. The attacker also requires low privileges on the target system.
