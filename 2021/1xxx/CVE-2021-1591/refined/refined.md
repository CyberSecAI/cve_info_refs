    "summary": "The provided documents describe a vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9500 Series Switches, identified as CVE-2021-1591. The vulnerability is caused by oversubscription of resources when applying Access Control Lists (ACLs) to port channel interfaces. This allows a remote, unauthenticated attacker to bypass the configured ACL rules, potentially accessing network resources that should be protected.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to oversubscription of resources when Access Control Lists (ACLs) are applied to port channel interfaces.",
      "vulnerabilities": "The vulnerability lies in the EtherChannel port subscription logic, specifically when ACLs are enabled on port channels, especially with subinterfaces configured on member interfaces. This leads to a resource oversubscription issue that causes ACL rules to be bypassed.",
      "impact": "A successful exploit of this vulnerability allows an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass the configured ACLs on the affected device. This results in unauthorized access to network resources that should have been protected by the ACLs.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is remote and network-based. The attacker attempts to access network resources that are protected by the ACL.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be unauthenticated and have remote network access to the affected Cisco Nexus 9500 Series Switch. No special privileges or user interaction is required.",
       "additional_details": "The vulnerability is more likely to be exploited in port channels that have member interfaces configured with subinterfaces. The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.  Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability. There are no known workarounds."
