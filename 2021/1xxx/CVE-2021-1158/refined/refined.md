Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1158:

**1. Verification:**

The content from `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com_9c14fe5d_20250115_135127.html` and `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com_caf5c355_20250115_223105.html` directly mentions CVE-2021-1158 as a vulnerability affecting Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W routers. This confirms that the content is related to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerabilities are caused by **insufficient input validation** in the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco routers.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts that are stored on the router and executed when a user interacts with the affected part of the web interface.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based management interface.
*   **Access to Sensitive Browser Information:** Attackers may be able to access sensitive information stored in the user's browser, such as cookies and session tokens.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to the affected device.
*   **Web-Based Management Interface:** The attack is carried out through the vulnerable web interface of the routers.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Administrative Credentials:** The attacker must have valid administrator credentials for the affected Cisco router to exploit these vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the device, either locally (LAN) or remotely if remote management is enabled.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected routers are end-of-life and will not receive software updates to fix these vulnerabilities.
*   Cisco recommends migrating to the Cisco Small Business RV132W, RV160, or RV160W Routers.
*   The advisory mentions multiple CVEs being associated with the same vulnerability, including CVE-2021-1151, CVE-2021-1152, CVE-2021-1153, CVE-2021-1154, CVE-2021-1155, CVE-2021-1156 and CVE-2021-1157.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 4.8 (Medium severity)

**Summary of relevant information:**

- The vulnerability is a stored XSS in the web management interface of specified Cisco small business routers
- It is caused by insufficient input validation
- Successful exploitation allows execution of arbitrary scripts in the context of the interface, and access to sensitive browser information
- It requires valid administrator credentials to exploit
- The routers affected are EOL and won't be patched
