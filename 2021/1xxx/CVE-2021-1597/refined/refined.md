Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1597:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com_5737598d_20250115_111852.html` and `tools.cisco.com_ea26e013_20250114_181008.html`  explicitly mentions CVE-2021-1597 as being related to a memory leak vulnerability in the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) implementation for Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras. It is included in a list of CVEs (CVE-2021-1595, CVE-2021-1596, CVE-2021-1597, CVE-2021-1598) associated with the same vulnerability. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerabilities are caused by the incorrect processing of certain LLDP packets at ingress time.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   Memory Leak: Specifically, the vulnerability allows for a memory leak, which can lead to denial-of-service.
    *   Incorrect LLDP Packet Processing: The root cause is the faulty way the devices process LLDP packets.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Denial of Service (DoS): Successful exploitation results in the device continuously consuming memory, eventually leading to a crash and reload, thus causing a DoS condition.
*  **Attack vectors:**
    *   Sending crafted LLDP packets to an affected device.
    *   LLDP is a layer 2 protocol, so the attacker must be in the same broadcast domain as the vulnerable device (Layer 2 adjacent).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Unauthenticated, adjacent attacker.
    *   The attacker must be Layer 2 adjacent to the affected device, meaning they must be on the same network segment.

**3. Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras with firmware releases earlier than 2.12.4 are affected.
*   **Unaffected Products:**  The following products are confirmed to be not affected:
    *   Video Surveillance 3000 Series IP Cameras
    *   Video Surveillance 4000 Series High-Definition IP Cameras
    *   Video Surveillance 4300E High-Definition IP Cameras
    *   Video Surveillance 4500E High-Definition IP Cameras
    *  Video Surveillance 6000 Series IP Cameras
    *   Video Surveillance 8000 Series IP Cameras
    *   Video Surveillance PTZ IP Cameras
*   **Workarounds:** There are no workarounds available to mitigate the vulnerabilities.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerabilities are fixed in firmware releases 2.12.4 and later for the Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras.
*   **CVSS Score:** The base CVSS score for the vulnerability is 6.5, with a vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.
*  **Exploitation:** At the time of the advisory, Cisco was not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of these vulnerabilities.
*  **Acknowledgement:** Cisco thanks Qian Chen of Codesafe Team of Legendsec at Qi'anxin Group for reporting these vulnerabilities.
*  **CWE:** The advisory lists CWE-401, which is a memory leak.

**4. Summary:**

The vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1597 allows an attacker within the same Layer 2 broadcast domain to cause a denial of service against Cisco Video Surveillance 7000 Series IP Cameras by sending crafted LLDP packets, causing a memory leak. The provided content gives a good overview of the vulnerability, affected products, and remediation.
