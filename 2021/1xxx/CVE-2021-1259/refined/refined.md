Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-1259:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to insufficient validation of HTTP requests within the web-based management interface of Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The software fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal character sequences (e.g., `../`) to access files outside of the intended web root directory.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The system does not adequately validate HTTP requests, which allows an attacker to inject malicious characters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to write arbitrary files on the affected system. This can lead to:
  - **System Compromise:**  Overwriting system files with malicious ones, potentially gaining full control over the device.
  - **Data Manipulation:** Altering sensitive data or configurations stored on the file system.
  - **Denial of Service:**  Writing files that cause the system to malfunction or crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Network Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely via the network.
- **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends crafted HTTP requests containing directory traversal character sequences to the vulnerable system.
- **Web-Based Management Interface:** The attack targets the web interface of the Cisco SD-WAN vManage software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Cisco SD-WAN vManage software.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable system's web interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software releases earlier than Release 18.2.0.
- Cisco has released software updates (version 18.2.0 and later) to address the issue.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than applying the software updates.
- The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability described in this advisory.
- The vulnerability was found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
- The vulnerability is tracked with Cisco Bug IDs CSCvi59632 and CSCvk28549.
- The vulnerability is classified as medium severity with a CVSS base score of 5.3
- This is a CWE-22 (Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a Restricted Directory) vulnerability
