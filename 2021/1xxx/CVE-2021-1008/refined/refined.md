Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1008:

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-1008 is a Denial-of-Service (DoS) vulnerability found in the telephony framework of Android. It allows a malicious application to cause a denial of service.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the `getSubscriberId` method within the telephony framework, specifically how it handles package UID (User ID) verification when a different app's package name is provided. An attacker could exploit this by providing a package name that doesn't match the provided UID.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The `getSubscriberId` method in the telephony framework, when called with a package name, only verifies against the calling app's UID, and then it also checks the provided UID matches the provided package name. However, it was not verifying that the provided UID truly corresponded to the provided package name. An app could attempt to pass in the package name of another app, with its own UID, to see if the app is present on the device, to gather information about what other apps are installed on the device.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A malicious app can cause the telephony service to crash due to an exception.
- This leads to a denial of service, as the telephony service becomes unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious application on the device can invoke the vulnerable `getSubscriberId` method.
- It can attempt to use a different application's package name with its own UID, or an invalid UID.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the target Android device.
- The malicious application needs the permission to interact with the telephony service.

**Technical Details (from the provided commits):**
- The fix (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/opt/telephony/+/14be358a42baec86a455eb29f5bfd7b199f1f723) adds a check to ensure that the provided package UID matches that of the provided package name.  If they do not match, a `SecurityException` is thrown. This fixes the information disclosure issue.
- Another commit (https://android.googlesource.com/platform/frameworks/base/+/f4d8bd16b7788abd26313ec2be3a630b43c233c9) is present for this CVE, indicating the issue affects multiple components within the system.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a "Moderate" severity issue.
- The fix was released as part of the December 2021 Pixel Update Bulletin.
- The vulnerability was addressed in AOSP version 12.

This analysis provides a clear picture of the vulnerability, how it can be exploited, and the fix that was implemented.
