{
  "Root cause": "The software incorrectly forwards IPv6 packets that have an IPv6 node-local multicast group address destination and are received on the management interfaces.",
  "Weaknesses": [
    "Incorrect IPv6 packet forwarding on management interfaces",
      "Lack of proper validation of IPv6 packets with node-local multicast group address destination"
  ],
  "Impact": "An attacker could cause an IPv6 flood on the management interface network, leading to excessive network traffic and potentially a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
  "Attack vectors": "An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker can connect to the same network as the management interfaces and inject IPv6 packets with a node-local multicast group address.",
  "Required attacker capabilities": "The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable Cisco IOS XR Software management interfaces and have the ability to inject IPv6 packets."
