  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-1437",
      "relevance": "RELATED",
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an unrestricted Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) configuration in the FlexConnect Upgrade feature of Cisco Aironet Series Access Points Software.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper access control",
        "Unrestricted TFTP configuration"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated, remote attacker could obtain confidential information from an affected device. Successful exploitation allows an attacker to download any file from the filesystem of the affected access point (AP).",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a specific TFTP request to an affected device.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send TFTP requests to the affected device. No authentication is needed."

      {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-1439",
      "relevance": "RELATED",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient input validation of incoming mDNS traffic.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Insufficient input validation",
        "Improper handling of mDNS traffic"
      ],
      "impact": "An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker could cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device, leading to an access point (AP) reboot.",
        "attack_vector": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted mDNS packet to an affected device through a wireless network configured in FlexConnect local switching mode or through a wired network on a configured mDNS VLAN.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be adjacent to the affected network and be able to send crafted mDNS packets."
    },
      {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-1449",
      "relevance": "RELATED",
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to an improper check performed by the code that manages system startup processes, allowing a bypass of software image verification during the boot process.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper code verification",
        "Insufficient validation during boot process"
      ],
        "impact": "An authenticated, local attacker with access to the development shell (devshell) can execute unsigned code at boot time and bypass the secure boot process.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by modifying a specific file stored on the system.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have local access to the device and authentication to access the development shell (devshell)."
