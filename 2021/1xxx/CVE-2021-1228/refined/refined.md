    "summary": "The provided documents describe a vulnerability in Cisco Nexus 9000 Series Fabric Switches in ACI mode (CVE-2021-1228) related to unauthorized access to the infrastructure VLAN. The vulnerability is caused by insufficient security checks during the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) setup phase of the infrastructure VLAN, which could be exploited by sending a crafted LLDP packet on an adjacent subnet, leading to an unauthorized server connecting to the infrastructure VLAN and potentially accessing Cisco APIC services or joining other host endpoints.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to insufficient security requirements during the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) setup phase of the infrastructure VLAN.",
      "weaknesses": "Insufficient security requirements during the Link Layer Discovery Protocol (LLDP) setup phase of the infrastructure VLAN.",
      "impact": "An attacker could connect an unauthorized server to the infrastructure VLAN, which is highly privileged. With a connection to the infrastructure VLAN, the attacker can make unauthorized connections to Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) services or join other host endpoints.",
      "attack_vector": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending a crafted LLDP packet on the adjacent subnet to an affected device.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "An unauthenticated, adjacent attacker is required to send a crafted LLDP packet on the adjacent subnet."
