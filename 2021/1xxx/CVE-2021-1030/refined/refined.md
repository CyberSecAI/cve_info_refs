Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1030:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is related to how the system handles package visibility restrictions, specifically in the `checkExistsAndEnforceCannotModifyImmutablyRestrictedPermission()` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The core issue lies in insufficient filtering of package visibility when checking for immutably restricted permissions. This could allow a malicious application to potentially bypass intended restrictions on modifying permissions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially leverage this vulnerability to modify the immutable permission, which could allow for privilege escalation or other unintended changes to the Android system's permission model. Specifically the vulnerability can lead to Information Disclosure.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector would likely involve a malicious application attempting to exploit the insufficient checks in `checkExistsAndEnforceCannotModifyImmutablyRestrictedPermission()` by crafting a specific request that bypasses the intended visibility restrictions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker would need to be able to install a malicious application on the Android device. The application would then need to craft requests that exploit the vulnerability in the permission handling.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this issue includes a filter on package visibility
- The commit message states "Filter package visibility in checkExistsAndEnforceCannotModifyImmutablyRestrictedPermission()." This confirms the core of the problem.
- The related commit `3796d9756a3e62988813051a24aca7a7db58ca2b` addresses CVE-2021-1030 and CVE-2021-1031 which are related.
