   - The content directly mentions `CVE-2021-1425` within a Cisco Security Advisory. Therefore, the content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability exists because sensitive information, specifically configured passwords, are included in the HTTP requests exchanged between the user and the Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA).

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Information Disclosure:** Confidential information is exposed within the HTTP requests, allowing an attacker to potentially access it.
   - **CWE-201:** This is explicitly stated as the relevant CWE, which stands for "Information Exposure Through Sent Data."

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - Successful exploitation allows an attacker to obtain passwords configured within the SMA's management interface. This could lead to unauthorized access to the system or other network resources.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network:** The attack is carried out remotely via the network.
   - **Web-based Management Interface:**  The vulnerability exists in the SMA's web-based interface.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the web management interface of the Cisco SMA.
   - **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability from a remote location.
   - **Monitoring HTTP requests:** The attacker has to monitor or intercept the HTTP requests to gain access to the exposed passwords.

**Additional Technical Details:**
   - The vulnerability affects Cisco AsyncOS Software for Cisco SMA releases earlier than 13.8.0.
   - The advisory notes that no workarounds are available, necessitating software upgrades to remediate the vulnerability.
   - Cisco assigns a CVSS base score of 4.3 to the vulnerability, with the vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
    - **AV:N** - Attack Vector: Network
    - **AC:L** - Attack Complexity: Low
    - **PR:L** - Privileges Required: Low
    - **UI:N** - User Interaction: None
    - **S:U** - Scope: Unchanged
    - **C:L** - Confidentiality: Low
    - **I:N** - Integrity: None
    - **A:N** - Availability: None
   - Fixed releases are stated as version 13.8.0 and later of the Cisco SMA software.
