  "CVE-2021-1422": {
    "Description": "A vulnerability in the software cryptography module of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an authenticated, remote attacker or an unauthenticated attacker in a man-in-the-middle position to cause an unexpected reload of the device that results in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "Root cause": "The vulnerability is due to a logic error in how the software cryptography module handles specific types of decryption errors.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Logic error in software cryptography module"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit could cause the device to crash, forcing it to reload, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Sending malicious packets over an established IPsec connection"
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An authenticated, remote attacker or an unauthenticated attacker in a man-in-the-middle position."
