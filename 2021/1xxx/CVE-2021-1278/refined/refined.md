  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerabilities are due to the absence of validation checks for the input that is used to create symlinks.",
    "weakness": "Insufficient input validation.",
    "impact": "An attacker could create a symlink to a target file on a specific path, potentially corrupting the contents of the file. If the file is a critical systems file, this could lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.",
