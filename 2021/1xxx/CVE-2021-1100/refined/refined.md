Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-1100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies within the NVIDIA vGPU software's Virtual GPU Manager kernel mode driver (`nvidia.ko`).
- The core issue is that a pointer to a user-space buffer is not validated before being dereferenced.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Lack of input validation, specifically the user-space buffer pointer.
- Dereferencing an unvalidated pointer which can lead to an invalid memory access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS). The vulnerability allows a potential attacker to crash the driver or system by triggering the invalid memory access.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required (AV:L) to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to interact with the vGPU driver in order to pass a malformed pointer.
- No special privileges are required for this attack, the privilege is "None" (PR:N).
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability (UI:N).
