*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the web-based management interface.
    *   An attacker could potentially access sensitive, browser-based information such as cookies, session tokens.
*  **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through a crafted link which, when clicked by a user, allows the malicious script to execute in their browser within the context of the vulnerable web interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated, remote user (requires administrative credentials on the affected device).
    *   The attacker must persuade a victim to click a crafted link to trigger the exploit.

**3. Additional details:**
