{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies within the `frameworks/base` component and involves insufficient user checking during snoozing.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Elevation of Privilege (EoP)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could potentially gain elevated privileges on the affected system.",
  "Attack vectors": "The specific attack vector is not detailed but involves exploiting a flaw in the framework related to how user snoozing is handled.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker would need to be able to interact with the system in a way that involves the snoozing functionality."
