Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-1356:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient error handling in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Vulnerability in the web UI software that can be triggered by sending crafted HTTP packets.
- Improper handling of user input can lead to resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can cause the web UI software to become unresponsive.
- The attack consumes all available vty lines, preventing new sessions and leading to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition.
- Manual intervention (clearing the vty lines or reloading the device) is required to restore functionality.
- Console connections are not affected.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attacker with read-only privileges can send crafted HTTP packets to an affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Requires an authenticated, remote attacker.
- The attacker must have read-only privileges on the affected device.
- The HTTP server feature must be enabled on the target device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is specific to the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software, and requires the HTTP server feature to be enabled on the affected device.
- The presence of "ip http active-session-modules none" or "ip http secure-active-session-modules none" in the device configuration mitigates the vulnerability over HTTP and HTTPS, respectively.
- Affected devices might show unexpected idle vty sessions with "HTTP CP" in the Host(s) column.
- There are no workarounds; upgrading to a fixed software version is required to fully address the vulnerability.
- Disabling the HTTP server feature will mitigate the vulnerability by eliminating the attack vector.
