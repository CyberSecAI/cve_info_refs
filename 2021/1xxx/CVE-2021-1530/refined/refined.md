Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1530:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing specific XML files within the Cisco BroadWorks Messaging Server Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The core weakness is the presence of an XXE injection vulnerability. The software doesn't properly sanitize or validate external entity references within XML files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to retrieve files from the local system, leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
- **Partial Denial of Service (DoS):** By crafting a malicious XML file that consumes available resources, the attacker can cause a partial DoS condition on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely through the web-based management interface.
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid credentials to access the management interface to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Malicious XML File Upload:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by uploading a crafted XML file containing malicious external entity references.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the affected Cisco BroadWorks Messaging Server.
- **Authentication:** The attacker requires valid credentials to access the web-based management interface.
- **XML Crafting Skills:** The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious XML file with external entity references to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects Cisco BroadWorks Messaging Server Release 22.0.
- Cisco provided a workaround: removing patch AP.ums.22.0.1123.ap371773 until corrective patch AP.ums.22.0.1123.ap378900 can be deployed.
- A firmware patch is available as a fix.
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing by Cisco.
- The CVSS score is 5.4 (Medium severity) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:L
