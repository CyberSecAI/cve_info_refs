Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1143:

**Vulnerability:** Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX) User Enumeration Vulnerability

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of authorization checks for specific API GET requests within Cisco CMX.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary vulnerability is the absence of proper authorization checks for certain API GET requests. This allows authenticated users to potentially access information they shouldn't have access to.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to information disclosure by enabling the enumeration of users within the CMX system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit allows a remote, authenticated attacker to enumerate users of the CMX system. This means an attacker could discover the usernames of all registered users.
- While the direct impact is limited to user enumeration, this information can be a stepping stone for more serious attacks (e.g., password guessing).

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability remotely via network access.
- **API Access:** The attacker sends specific, malicious API GET requests to the vulnerable CMX system.
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system to send the malicious API requests

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the CMX system.
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials for the CMX system to send the malicious API requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3, categorized as Medium severity.
- Cisco has released a software update (CMX Release 10.6.3) to address this vulnerability.
- No workarounds are available.
- At the time of the advisory's publication, there were no reports of public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported to Cisco by employees of Conscia.
