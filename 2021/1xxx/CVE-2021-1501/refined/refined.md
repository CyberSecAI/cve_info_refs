        "text": "A vulnerability in the SIP inspection engine of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash and reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.\r\n\r\nThe vulnerability is due to a crash that occurs during a hash lookup for a SIP pinhole connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash and reload of the affected device.\r\n\r\nCisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThis advisory is part of the April 2021 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see Cisco Event Response: April 2021 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74594\"]."

The device is considered vulnerable if the output includes Inspect: sip, as shown in this example:\r\n\r\n\r\ndevice# show service-policy | include sip\r\nInspect: sip , packet 2, lock fail 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0, 5-min-pkt-rate 0 pkts/sec, v6-fail-close 0 sctp-drop-override 0\r\n\r\nNote: SIP inspection is enabled by default on Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software. For detailed information about the default settings for application inspection policies, see the Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/configuration/firewall/asa-99-firewall-config/inspect-service-policy.html#ID-2094-0000026e\"]."

        "title": "Workarounds",
        "text": "There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there are mitigation options that apply to both physical and virtual appliances.\r\n Option 1: Disable SIP Inspection\r\nDisabling SIP inspection will completely close the attack vector for this vulnerability. However, this mitigation may not be suitable for all customers. In particular, disabling SIP inspection would break SIP connections if either Network Address Translation (NAT) is applied to SIP traffic or if any ports that are required for SIP communication are not opened through ACL.\r\n\r\nTo disable SIP inspection in Cisco ASA Software, use the following command:\r\n\r\n\r\npolicy-map \r\n class inspection_default\r\n no inspect sip\r\n\r\nTo disable SIP inspection in Cisco FTD Software, use the following command in the CLI:\r\n\r\n\r\nconfigure inspection sip disable\r\n\r\n\r\n Option 2: Allow Only Trusted SIP Hosts Using ACLs\r\nUse ACLs to limit SIP connection through the device to known, trusted SIP hosts. For information on Cisco ASA and FTD ACL configuration, see Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide: Access Control Lists [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa96/configuration/firewall/asa-96-firewall-config/access-acls.html\"].\r\n\r\nWhile these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment."

Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:\r\nhttps://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html\"]\r\n\r\nAdditionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.\r\n\r\nWhen considering software upgrades [\"https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes\"], customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the Cisco Security Advisories page [\"https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt\"], to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.\r\n\r\nIn all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers.\r\n Customers Without Service Contracts\r\nCustomers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html\"]\r\n\r\nCustomers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.\r\n Fixed Releases\r\nIn the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by any of the vulnerabilities described in this bundle and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.\r\n\r\nASA Software\r\n Cisco ASA Software Release First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability First Fixed Release for All the Vulnerabilities Described in the Bundle of Advisories Earlier than 9.81 Not vulnerable.

Cisco ASA Software releases 9.7 and earlier, as well as Release 9.10, have reached end of software maintenance [\"https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-listing.html\"]. Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\nFTD Software\r\n Cisco FTD Software Release First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability Recommended Release for All the Vulnerabilities Described in the Bundle of Advisories Earlier than 6.2.21 Not vulnerable. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.2.2 Migrate to a fixed release. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.2.3 Migrate to a fixed release. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.3.0 Migrate to a fixed release. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.4.0 6.4.0.12 (May 2021) 6.4.0.12 (May 2021) 6.5.0 Migrate to a fixed release. Migrate to a fixed release. 6.6.0 6.6.4 6.6.42 6.7.0 6.7.0.2 6.7.0.2\r\n1.

Customers are advised to migrate to a supported release that includes the fix for this vulnerability.\r\n\r\n2. The First Fixed Release for the 6.6.0 code train was 6.6.3; however, due to upgrade issues associated with CSCvx86231 [\"https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvx86231\"] the recommended release is 6.6.4.\r\n\r\nTo upgrade to a fixed release of Cisco FTD Software, do one of the following:\r\n\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC), use the FMC interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy.\r\nFor devices that are managed by using Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM), use the FDM interface to install the upgrade. After installation is complete, reapply the access control policy."
