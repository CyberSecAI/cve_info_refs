# CLI Book 2: Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide, 9.6

Bias-Free Language

### Bias-Free Language

The documentation set for this product strives to use bias-free language. For the purposes of this documentation set, bias-free is defined as language that does not imply discrimination based on age, disability, gender, racial identity, ethnic identity, sexual orientation, socioeconomic status, and intersectionality. Exceptions may be present in the documentation due to language that is hardcoded in the user interfaces of the product software, language used based on RFP documentation, or language that is used by a referenced third-party product. [Learn more](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/social-justice/inclusive-language-policy.html) about how Cisco is using Inclusive Language.

# Access Control Lists

Access control lists (ACLs) are used by many different features.
When applied to interfaces or globally as access rules, they permit or deny
traffic that flows through the appliance. For other features, the ACL selects
the traffic to which the feature will apply, performing a matching service
rather than a control service.

The following sections explain the basics of ACLs and how to
configure and monitor them. Access rules, ACLs applied globally or to
interfaces, are explained in more detail in
[Access Rules](access-rules.html#ID-2124-00000004).

## About ACLs

Access control lists (ACLs) identify traffic flows by one or more characteristics, including source and destination IP address,
IP protocol, ports, EtherType, and other parameters, depending on the type of ACL. ACLs are used in a variety of features.
ACLs are made up of one or more access control entries (ACEs).

### ACL Types

The ASA uses the following types of ACLs:

* Extended ACLs—Extended ACLs are the main type that you will use.
  These ACLs are used for access rules to permit and deny traffic through the
  device, and for traffic matching by many features, including service policies,
  AAA rules, WCCP, Botnet Traffic Filter, and VPN group and DAP policies.
   See
  [Configure Extended ACLs](#ID-2069-00000203).
* EtherType ACLs—EtherType ACLs apply to non-IP layer-2 traffic on
  bridge group member interfaces only. You can use these rules to permit or drop
  traffic based on the EtherType value in the layer-2 packet. With EtherType
  ACLs, you can control the flow of non-IP traffic across the device.
  See
  [Configure EtherType ACLs](#ID-2069-000005df).
* Webtype ACLs—Webtype ACLs are used for filtering clientless SSL
  VPN traffic. These ACLs can deny access based on URLs or destination
  addresses. See
  [Configure Webtype ACLs](#ID-2069-000004ba).
* Standard ACLs—Standard ACLs identify traffic by destination
  address only. There are few features that use them: route maps and VPN filters.
  Because VPN filters also allow extended access lists, limit standard ACL use to
  route maps. See
  [Configure Standard ACLs](#ID-2069-00000431).

The following table lists some common uses for ACLs and the type
to use.

Table 1. ACL Types and Common Uses

| ACL Use | ACL Type | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Control network access for IP traffic (routed and transparent mode) | Extended | The ASA does not allow any traffic from a lower security interface to a higher security interface unless it is explicitly permitted by an extended ACL.   | **Note** | To access the ASA interface for management access, you do not also need an ACL allowing the host IP address. You only need to configure management access according to the general operations configuration guide. | | --- | --- | |
| Identify traffic for AAA rules | Extended | AAA rules use ACLs to identify traffic. |
| Augment network access control for IP traffic for a given user | Extended, downloaded from a AAA server per user | You can configure the RADIUS server to download a dynamic ACL to be applied to the user, or the server can send the name of an ACL that you already configured on the ASA. |
| VPN access and filtering | Extended  Standard | Group policies for remote access and site to site VPNs use standard or extended ACLs for filtering. Remote access VPNs also use extended ACLs for client firewall configurations and dynamic access policies. |
| Identify traffic in a traffic class map for Modular Policy Framework | Extended | ACLs can be used to identify traffic in a class map, which is used for features that support Modular Policy Framework. Features that support Modular Policy Framework include TCP and general connection settings, and inspection. |
| For bridge group member interfaces, control network access for non-IP traffic | EtherType | You can configure an ACL that controls traffic based on its EtherType for any interface that is a member of a bridge group. |
| Identify route filtering and redistribution | Standard  Extended | Various routing protocols use standard ACLs for route filtering and redistribution (through route maps) for IPv4 addresses, and extended ACLs for IPv6. |
| Filtering for clientless SSL VPN | Webtype | You can configure a webtype ACL to filter URLs and destinations. |

### ACL Names

Each ACL has a name or numeric ID, such as outside\_in,
OUTSIDE\_IN, or 101. Limit the names to 241 characters or fewer.Consider using
all uppercase letters to make it easier to find the name when viewing a running
configuration.

Develop a naming convention that will help you identify the
intended purpose of the ACL. For example, ASDM uses the convention
*interface-name\_purpose\_direction*, such as
“outside\_access\_in”, for an ACL applied to the “outside” interface in the
inbound direction.

Traditionally, ACL IDs were numbers. Standard ACLs were in the
range 1-99 or 1300-1999. Extended ACLs were in the range 100-199 or 2000-2699.
The ASA does not enforce these ranges, but if you want to use numbers, you
might want to stick to these conventions to maintain consistency with routers
running IOS Software.

### Access Control Entry Order

An ACL is made up of one or more ACEs. Unless you explicitly
insert an ACE at a given line, each ACE that you enter for a given ACL name is
appended to the end of the ACL.

The order of ACEs is important. When the ASA decides whether to
forward or drop a packet, the ASA tests the packet against each ACE in the
order in which the entries are listed. After a match is found, no more ACEs are
checked.

Thus, if you place a more specific rule after a more general
rule, the more specific rule might never be hit. For example, if you want to
permit network 10.1.1.0/24, but drop traffic from host 10.1.1.15 on that
subnet, the ACE that denies 10.1.1.15 must come before the one that permits
10.1.1.0/24. If the permit 10.1.1.0/24 ACE comes first, 10.1.1.15 will be
allowed, and the deny ACE will never be matched.

In an extended ACL, use the
line
*number* parameter on the
access-list command to insert rules at the right
location. Use the
show access-list
*name* command to view the ACL entries and their line numbers
to help determine the right number to use. For other types of ACL, you must
rebuild the ACL (or better, use ASDM) to change the order of ACEs.

### Permit/Deny vs. Match/Do Not Match

Access control entries either “permit” or “deny” traffic that matches the rule. When you apply an ACL to a feature that determines
whether traffic is allowed through the ASA or is dropped, such as global and interface access rules, “permit” and “deny” mean
what they say.

For other features, such as service policy rules, “permit” and “deny” actually mean “match” or “do not match.” In these cases,
the ACL is selecting the traffic that should receive the services of that feature, such as application inspection or redirection
to a service module. “Denied” traffic is simply traffic that does not match the ACL, and thus will not receive the service.

### Access Control Implicit Deny

ACLs that are used for through-the-box access rules have an implicit deny statement at the end. Thus, for traffic controlling
ACLs such as those applied to interfaces, if you do not explicitly permit a type of traffic, that traffic is dropped. For
example, if you want to allow all users to access a network through the ASA except for one or more particular addresses, then
you need to deny those particular addresses and then permit all others.

For management (control plane) ACLs, which control to-the-box traffic, there is no implicit deny at the end of a set of management
rules for an interface. Instead, any connection that does not match a management access rule is then evaluated by regular
access control rules.

For ACLs used to select traffic for a service, you must explicitly “permit” the traffic; any traffic not “permitted” will
not be matched for the service; “denied” traffic bypasses the service.

For EtherType ACLs, the implicit deny at the end of the ACL does not affect IP traffic or ARPs; for example, if you allow
EtherType 8037, the implicit deny at the end of the ACL does not now block any IP traffic that you previously allowed with
an extended ACL (or implicitly allowed from a high security interface to a low security interface). However, if you *explicitly* deny all traffic with an EtherType ACE, then IP and ARP traffic is denied; only physical protocol traffic, such as auto-negotiation,
is still allowed.

### IP Addresses Used for Extended ACLs When You Use NAT

When you use NAT or PAT, you are translating
addresses or ports, typically mapping between internal and external addresses.
If you need to create an extended ACL that applies to addresses or ports that
have been translated, you need to determine whether to use the real
(untranslated) addresses or ports or the mapped ones. The requirement differs
by feature.

Using the real address and port means that if the
NAT configuration changes, you do not need to change the ACLs.

#### Features That Use Real IP Addresses

The following commands and features use real IP
addresses in the ACLs, even if the address as seen on an interface is the
mapped address:

* Access Rules (extended ACLs referenced by
  the
  **access-group** command)
* Service Policy Rules (Modular Policy
  Framework **match access-list** command)
* Botnet Traffic Filter traffic classification
  (**dynamic-filter enable classify-list** command)
* AAA Rules (**aaa ...
  match** commands)
* WCCP (**wccp
  redirect-list group-list** command)

For example, if you configure NAT for an inside
server, 10.1.1.5, so that it has a publicly routable IP address on the outside,
209.165.201.5, then the access rule to allow the outside traffic to access the
inside server needs to reference the server’s real IP address (10.1.1.5), and
not the mapped address (209.165.201.5).

```

hostname(config)# object network server1
hostname(config-network-object)# host 10.1.1.5
hostname(config-network-object)# nat (inside,outside) static 209.165.201.5

hostname(config)# access-list OUTSIDE extended permit tcp any host 10.1.1.5 eq www
hostname(config)# access-group OUTSIDE in interface outside

```

#### Features That Use Mapped IP Addresses

The following features use ACLs, but these ACLs
use the mapped values as seen on an interface:

* IPsec ACLs
* **capture** command
  ACLs
* Per-user ACLs
* Routing protocol ACLs
* All other feature ACLs.

### Time-Based ACEs

You can apply time range objects to extended and webtype ACEs so
that the rules are active for specific time periods only. These types of rules
let you differentiate between activity that is acceptable at certain times of
the day but that is unacceptable at other times. For example, you could provide
additional restrictions during working hours, and relax them after work hours
or at lunch. Conversely, you could essentially shut your network down during
non-work hours.

You cannot create time-based rules that have the exact same protocol,
source, destination, and service criteria of a rule that does not include a
time range object. The non-time-based rule always overrides the duplicate
time-based rule, as they are redundant.

| **Note** | ---   Users could experience a delay of approximately 80 to 100 seconds after the specified end time for the ACL to become inactive. For example, if the specified end time is 3:50, because the end time is inclusive, the command is picked up anywhere between 3:51:00 and 3:51:59. After the command is picked up, the ASA finishes any currently running task and then services the command to deactivate the ACL.   --- |
| --- | --- |

## Licensing for Access Control Lists

Access control lists do not require a
special license.

However, to use
sctp  as the protocol in an entry, you must have
a Carrier license.

## Guidelines for ACLs

### Firewall Mode

* Extended and standard ACLs are supported in routed and
  transparent firewall modes.
* Webtype ACLs are supported in routed mode only.
* EtherType ACLs are supported in transparent mode only.

### Failover and Clustering

Configuration sessions are not synchronized across failover or
clustered units. When you commit the changes in a session, they are made in all
failover and cluster units as normal.

### IPv6

* Extended and webtype ACLs allow a mix of IPv4 and IPv6
  addresses.
* Standard ACLs do not allow IPv6 addresses.
* EtherType ACLs do not contain IP addresses.

### Additional Guidelines

* When you specify a network mask, the method is different from
  the Cisco IOS software
  **access-list** command. The ASA uses a network mask (for
  example, 255.255.255.0 for a Class C mask). The Cisco IOS mask uses wildcard
  bits (for example, 0.0.0.255).
* Normally, you cannot reference an object or object group that
  does not exist in an ACL or object group, or delete one that is currently
  referenced. You also cannot reference an ACL that does not exist in an
  **access-group** command (to apply access rules). However, you
  can change this default behavior so that you can “forward reference” objects or
  ACLs before you create them. Until you create the objects or ACLs, any rules or
  access groups that reference them are ignored. To enable forward
  referencing, use the
  **forward-reference enable** command.
* (Extended ACL only) The following features use ACLs, but cannot
  accept an ACL with identity firewall (specifying user or group names), FQDN
  (fully-qualified domain names), or Cisco TrustSec values:

  + VPN
    **crypto map** command
  + VPN
    **group-policy** command, except for
    **vpn-filter**
  + WCCP
  + DAP

## Configure ACLs

The following sections explain how to configure the various
types of ACL, Read the section on ACL basics to get the big picture, then the
sections on specific types of ACL for the details.

* [Basic ACL Configuration and Management Options](#ID-2069-0000011e)
* [Configure Extended ACLs](#ID-2069-00000203)
* [Configure Standard ACLs](#ID-2069-00000431)
* [Configure Webtype ACLs](#ID-2069-000004ba)
* [Configure EtherType ACLs](#ID-2069-000005df)

### Basic ACL Configuration and Management Options

An ACL is made up of one or more access control entries (ACEs)
with the same ACL ID or name. To create a new ACL, you simply create an ACE
with a new ACL name, and it becomes the first rule in the new ACL.

Working with an ACL, you can do the following things:

Examine the ACL contents and determine line numbers and hit counts

Use the
**show access-list**
*name* command to view the contents of the ACL. Each row is an
ACE, and includes the line number, which you will need to know if you want to
insert new entries into an extended ACL. The information also includes a hit
count for each ACE, which is how many times the rule was matched by traffic.
For example:

```

hostname# show access-list outside_access_in
access-list outside_access_in; 3 elements; name hash: 0x6892a938
access-list outside_access_in line 1 extended permit ip 10.2.2.0 255.255.255.0 any
(hitcnt=0) 0xcc48b55c
access-list outside_access_in line 2 extended permit ip host
2001:DB8::0DB8:800:200C:417A any (hitcnt=0) 0x79797f94
access-list outside_access_in line 3 extended permit ip user-group
LOCAL\\usergroup any any (hitcnt=0) 0xb0f5b1e1

```

Add an ACE

The command for adding an ACE is
**access-list**
*name* [**line**
*line-num*]
*type*
*parameters*. The line number argument works for extended ACLs
only. If you include the line number, the ACE is inserted at that location in
the ACL, and the ACE that was at that location is moved down, along with the
remainder of the ACEs (that is, inserting an ACE at a line number does not
replace the old ACE at that line). If you do not include a line number, the ACE
is added to the end of the ACL. The parameters available differ based on the
ACL type; see the specific topics on each ACL type for details.

Add comments to an ACL (all types except webtype)

Use the
**access-list**
*name* [**line**
*line-num*]
**remark**
*text* command to add remarks into an ACL to help explain the
purpose of an ACE. Best practice is to insert the remark before the ACE; if you
view the configuration in ASDM, remarks will be associated with the ACE that
follows the remarks. You can enter multiple remarks before an ACE to include an
expanded comment. Each remark is limited to 100 characters. You can include
leading spaces to help set off the remarks. If you do not include a line
number, the remark is added to the end of the ACL. For example, you could add
remarks before adding each ACE:

```

hostname(config)# access-list OUT remark - this is the inside admin address
hostname(config)# access-list OUT extended permit ip host 209.168.200.3 any
hostname(config)# access-list OUT remark - this is the hr admin address
hostname(config)# access-list OUT extended permit ip host 209.168.200.4 any

```

Edit or move an ACE or remark

You cannot edit or move an ACE or remark. Instead, you must
create a new ACE or remark with the desired values at the right location (using
the line number), then delete the old ACE or remark. Because you can insert
ACEs in extended ACLs only, you need to rebuild standard, webtype, or EtherType
ACLs if you need to edit or move ACEs. It is far easier to reorganize a long
ACL using ASDM.

Delete an ACE or remark

Use the
**no access-list**
*parameters* command to remove an ACE or remark. Use the
**show access-list** command to view the parameter string that
you must enter: the string must exactly match an ACE or remark to delete it,
with the exception of the
**line**
*line-num* argument, which is optional on the
**no access-list** command.

Delete an entire ACL, including remarks

Use the
**clear configure access-list**
*name* command. USE CAUTION! The command does not ask you for
confirmation. If you do not include a name, every access list on the ASA is
removed.

Rename an ACL

Use the
**access-list**
*name*
**rename**
*new\_name* command.

Apply the ACL to a policy

Creating an ACL in and of itself does nothing to traffic. You
must apply the ACL to a policy. For example, you can use the
**access-group** command to apply an extended ACL to an
interface, thus denying or permitting traffic that goes through the interface.

### Configure Extended ACLs

An extended ACL is composed of all ACEs with the
same ACL ID or name. Extended ACLs are the most complex and feature-rich type
of ACL, and you can use them for many features. The most noteworthy use of
extended ACLs is as access groups applied globally or to interfaces, which
determine the traffic that will be denied or permitted to flow through the box.
But extended ACLs are also used to determine the traffic to which other
services will be provided.

Because extended ACLs are complex, the following
sections focus on creating ACEs to provide specific types of traffic matching.
The first sections, on basic address-based ACEs and on TCP/UDP ACEs, build the
foundation for the remaining sections.

* [Add an Extended ACE for IP Address or Fully-Qualified Domain Name-Based Matching](#ID-2069-00000206)

* [Examples for Extended ACLs](#ID-2069-0000038e)
* [Example of Converting Addresses to Objects for Extended ACLs](#ID-2069-000003b4)

#### Add an Extended ACE for IP Address or Fully-Qualified Domain Name-Based Matching

The basic extended ACE matches traffic based on source and
destination addresses, including IPv4 and IPv6 addresses and fully-qualified
domain names (FQDN), such as www.example.com. In fact, every type of extended
ACE must include some specification for source and destination address, so this
topic explains the minimum extended ACE.

| **Tip** | ---   Tip If you want to match traffic based on FQDN, you must create a network object for each FQDN.   --- |
| --- | --- |

To add an ACE for IP address or FQDN matching, use the following
command:

**access-list***access\_list\_name* [**line**
*line\_number*]
**extended** {**deny** | **permit**}
*protocol\_argument source\_address\_argument dest\_address\_argument* [**log** [[*level*] [**interval**
*secs*] |
**disable** |
**default**]] [**time-range***time\_range\_name*] [**inactive**]

Example:

```

hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended permit ip any any
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended permit object service-obj-http any any

```

The options are:

* *access\_list\_name*—The name of the new or existing ACL.
* Line number—The
  line
  line\_number
   option specifies the line number at which insert the
  ACE; otherwise, the ACE is added to the end of the ACL.
* Permit or Deny—The
  deny  keyword
  denies or exempts a packet if the conditions are matched. The
  permit  keyword
  permits or includes a packet if the conditions are matched.
* Protocol—The
  *protocol\_argument* specifies the IP protocol:

  + *name* or
    *number*—Specifies the protocol name or number. Specify
    **ip** to apply to all protocols.
  + **object-group**
    *protocol\_grp\_id*—Specifies a protocol object group created
    using the
    **object-group protocol** command.
  + **object**
    *service\_obj\_id*—Specifies a service object created using the
    **object service** command. The object can include port or ICMP
    type and code specifications if desired.
  + **object-group**
    *service\_grp\_id*—Specifies a service object group created
    using the
    **object-group service** command.
* Source Address, Destination Address—The
  *source\_address\_argument* specifies the IP address or FQDN
  from which the packet is being sent, and the
  *dest\_address\_argument*specifies the IP address or FQDN to which the packet is being
  sent:

  + **host** *ip\_address*—Specifies an
    IPv4 host address.
  + *ip\_address mask*—Specifies an IPv4 network address and subnet
    mask, such as 10.100.10.0 255.255.255.0.
  + *ipv6-address***/***prefix-length*—Specifies
    an IPv6 host or network address and prefix.
  + **any**,
    **any4**, and
    **any6**—**any** specifies both IPv4
    and IPv6 traffic;
    **any4** specifies IPv4 traffic only; and
    **any6** specifies IPv6 traffic only.
  + **interface**
    *interface\_name*—Specifies the name of an ASA interface. Use
    the interface name rather than IP address to match traffic based on which
    interface is the source or destination of the traffic.
  + **object**
    *nw\_obj\_id*—Specifies a network object created using the
    **object network** command.
  + **object-group**
    *nw\_grp\_id*—Specifies a network object group created using the
    **object-group network** command.
* Logging—**log** arguments set
  logging options when an ACE matches a connection for network access (an ACL
  applied with the
  **access-group** command). If you enter the
  **log** option without any arguments, you enable syslog message
  106100 at the default level (6) and for the default interval (300 seconds). Log
  options are:

  + *level*—A severity level between 0 and 7. The default is 6
    (informational). If you change this level for an active ACE, the new level
    applies to new connections; existing connections continue to be logged at the
    previous level.
  + **interval***secs*—The time interval in seconds between syslog messages,
    from 1 to 600. The default is 300. This value is also used as the timeout value
    for deleting an inactive flow from the cache used to collect drop statistics.
  + **disable**—Disables all ACE logging.
  + **default**—Enables logging to message 106023 for denied
    packets. This setting is the same as not including the
    **log** option.
* Time Range—The
  **time-range**
  *time\_range\_name* option specifies a time range object, which
  determines the times of day and days of the week in which the ACE is active. If
  you do not include a time range, the ACE is always active.
* Activation—Use the
  **inactive** option to disable the ACE without deleting it. To
  reenable it, enter the entire ACE without the inactive keyword.

#### Add an Extended ACE for Port-Based Matching

If you specify service objects in an ACE, the service objects
can include protocols with port specifications, such as TCP/80. Alternatively,
you can specify the ports directly in the ACE. With port-based matching, you
can target certain types of traffic for port-based protocols rather than all
traffic for the protocol.

The port-based extended ACE is just the basic
address-matching ACE where the protocol is
tcp ,
udp , or
sctp . To add port specifications, use the
following command:

access-list
access\_list\_name [line
line\_number]
extended {deny |
permit} {tcp |
udp |
sctp}
source\_address\_argument [port\_argument]
dest\_address\_argument [port\_argument]
[log [[level] [interval
secs] |
disable |
default] [time-range
time-range-name] [inactive]

Example:

```

hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp any host 209.165.201.29 eq www

```

The
port\_argument  option specifies the source or
destination port. If you do not specify ports, all ports are matched. Available
arguments include:

* operator
  port —The
  port  can be the integer or name of a port.
  The
  operator  can be one of the following:

  + **lt**—less than
  + **gt**—greater than
  + **eq**—equal to
  + **neq**—not equal to
  + **range**—an inclusive range of values. When you use this
    operator, specify two port numbers, for example,
    **range 100
    200**.

  | **Note** | ---   DNS, Discard, Echo, Ident, NTP, RPC, SUNRPC, and Talk each require one definition for TCP and one for UDP. TACACS+ requires one definition for port 49 on TCP.   --- |
  | --- | --- |
* object-group
  service\_grp\_id —Specifies a service object group
  created using the
  object-group service {tcp |
  udp |
  tcp-udp}  command. Note that these object types
  are no longer recommended.

  You cannot specify the recommended generic service objects, where
  the protocol and port are defined within the object, as the port argument. You
  specify these objects as part of the protocol argument, as explained in
  [Add an Extended ACE for IP Address or Fully-Qualified Domain Name-Based Matching](#ID-2069-00000206).

For an explanation of the other keywords, and how to use service
objects to specify protocols and ports, see
[Add an Extended ACE for IP Address or Fully-Qualified Domain Name-Based Matching](#ID-2069-00000206).

#### Add an Extended ACE for ICMP-Based Matching

If you specify service objects in an ACE, the
service objects can include the ICMP/ICMP6 protocols ICMP type and code
specifications. Alternatively, you can specify the ICMP type and code directly
in the ACE. For example, you can target ICMP Echo Request traffic (pings).

The ICMP extended ACE is just the basic address-matching ACE
where the protocol is
icmp or
icmp6. Because these protocols have type and code
values, you can add type and code specifications to the ACE.

To add an ACE for IP address or FQDN matching, where the
protocol is ICMP or ICMP6, use the following command:

**access-list***access\_list\_name* [**line**
*line\_number*]
**extended** {**deny** |
**permit**} {**icmp** |
**icmp6**}
*source\_address\_argument dest\_address\_argument* [*icmp\_argument*] [**log** [[*level*] [**interval**
*secs*] |
**disable** |
**default**]] [**time-range***time\_range\_name*] [**inactive**]

Example:

```

hostname(config)# access-list abc extended permit icmp any any object-group obj_icmp_1
hostname(config)# access-list abc extended permit icmp any any echo

```

The *icmp\_argument* option specifies the ICMP type and code.

* *icmp\_type* [*icmp\_code*]—Specifies the
  ICMP type by name or number, and the optional ICMP code for that type. If you
  do not specify the code, then all codes are used.
* **object-group**
  *icmp\_grp\_id*—Specifies an object group for ICMP/ICMP6 created
  using the (deprecated)
  object-group icmp-type  command.

  You cannot specify the recommended generic service objects, where
  the protocol and type are defined within the object, as the ICMP argument. You
  specify these objects as part of the protocol argument, as explained in
  [Add an Extended ACE for IP Address or Fully-Qualified Domain Name-Based Matching](#ID-2069-00000206).

For an explanation of the other keywords, see
[Add an Extended ACE for IP Address or Fully-Qualified Domain Name-Based Matching](#ID-2069-00000206).

#### Add an Extended ACE for User-Based Matching (Identity Firewall)

The user-based extended ACE is just the basic address-matching
ACE where you include username or user group to the source matching criteria.
By creating rules based on user identity, you can avoid tying rules to static
host or network addresses. For example, if you define a rule for user1, and the
identity firewall feature maps that user to a host assigned 10.100.10.3 one
day, but 192.168.1.5 the next day, the user-based rule still applies.

Because you must still supply source and destination addresses,
broaden the source address to include the likely addresses that will be
assigned to the user (normally through DHCP). For example, user “LOCAL\user1
any” will match the LOCAL\user1 user no matter what address is assigned,
whereas “LOCAL\user1 10.100.1.0 255.255.255.0” matches the user only if the
address is on the 10.100.1.0/24 network.

By using group names, you can define rules based on entire
classes of users, such as students, teachers, managers, engineers, and so
forth.

To add an ACE for user or group matching, use the following
command:

**access-list***access\_list\_name* [**line**
*line\_number*]
**extended** {**deny** |
**permit**}
*protocol\_argument*[*user\_argument*]
*source\_address\_argument*[*port\_argument*]
*dest\_address\_argument* [*port\_argument*] [**log**
[[*level*] [**interval**
*secs*] |
**disable** |
**default**]] [**time-range***time\_range\_name*] [**inactive**]

Example:

```

hostname(config)# access-list v1 extended permit ip user LOCAL\idfw
any 10.0.0.0 255.255.255.0

```

The
*user\_argument*option specifies the user or group for which to match traffic in
addition to the source address. Available arguments include the following:

* **object-group-user**
  *user\_obj\_grp\_id*—Specifies a user object group created using
  the
  **object-group user** command.
* **user** {[*domain\_nickname***\**]*name* |
  **any** |
  **none**}—Specifies a username. Specify
  **any** to match all users with user credentials, or
  **none** to match addresses that are not mapped to usernames.
  These options are especially useful for combining **access-group**and
  **aaa authentication match**policies.
* **user-group**[*domain\_nickname***\\**]*user\_group\_name*—Specifies a user group name. Note the double
  \\ separating the domain and group name.

For an explanation of the other keywords, see
[Add an Extended ACE for IP Address or Fully-Qualified Domain Name-Based Matching](#ID-2069-00000206).

| **Tip** | ---   You can include both user and Cisco Trustsec security groups in a given ACE.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Add an Extended ACE for Security Group-Based Matching (Cisco TrustSec)

The security group (Cisco TrustSec) extended ACE is just the
basic address-matching ACE where you include security groups or tags to the
source or destination matching criteria. By creating rules based on security
groups, you can avoid tying rules to static host or network addresses. Because
you must still supply source and destination addresses, broaden the addresses
to include the likely addresses that will be assigned to users (normally
through DHCP).

| **Tip** | ---   Before adding this type of ACE, configure Cisco TrustSec.   --- |
| --- | --- |

To add an ACE for security group matching, use the following
command:

**access-list***access\_list\_name* [**line**
*line\_number*]
**extended** {**deny** |
**permit**}
*protocol\_argument* [*security\_group\_argument*]
*source\_address\_argument*[*port\_argument*] [*security\_group\_argument*]
*dest\_address\_argument* [*port\_argument*] [**log**
[[*level*] [**interval**
*secs*] |
**disable** |
**default**]] [**inactive** |
**time-range***time\_range\_name*]

Example:

```

hostname(config)# access-list INSIDE_IN extended permit ip
security-group name my-group any any

```

The
*security\_group\_argument* option specifies the security group
for which to match traffic in addition to the source or destination address.
Available arguments include the following:

* **object-group-security**
  *security\_obj\_grp\_id*—Specifies a security object group
  created using the
  **object-group security** command.
* **security-group** {**name**
  *security\_grp\_id*|
  **tag**
  *security\_grp\_tag*}—Specifies a security group name or tag.

For an explanation of the other keywords, see
[Add an Extended ACE for IP Address or Fully-Qualified Domain Name-Based Matching](#ID-2069-00000206).

| **Tip** | ---   You can include both user and Cisco Trustsec security groups in a given ACE.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Examples for Extended ACLs

The following ACL allows all hosts (on the
interface to which you apply the ACL) to go through the ASA:

```

hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended permit ip any any

```

The following ACL prevents hosts on 192.168.1.0/24
from accessing the 209.165.201.0/27 network for TCP-based traffic. All other
addresses are permitted.

```

hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
209.165.201.0 255.255.255.224
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended permit ip any any

```

If you want to restrict access to selected hosts
only, then enter a limited permit ACE. By default, all other traffic is denied
unless explicitly permitted.

```

hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended permit ip 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
209.165.201.0 255.255.255.224

```

The following ACL restricts all hosts (on the
interface to which you apply the ACL) from accessing a website at address
209.165.201.29. All other traffic is allowed.

```

hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp any host 209.165.201.29 eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended permit ip any any

```

The following ACL that uses object groups
restricts several hosts on the inside network from accessing several web
servers. All other traffic is allowed.

```

hostname(config-network)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp object-group denied
object-group web eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended permit ip any any
hostname(config)# access-group ACL_IN in interface inside

```

The following example temporarily disables an ACL
that permits traffic from one group of network objects (A) to another group of
network objects (B):

```

hostname(config)# access-list 104 permit ip host object-group A object-group B inactive

```

To implement a time-based ACE, use the
time-range  command to
define specific times of the day and week. Then use the
access-list extended
command to bind the time range to an ACE. The following example binds an ACE in
the “Sales” ACL to a time range named “New\_York\_Minute.”

```

hostname(config)# access-list Sales line 1 extended deny tcp host 209.165.200.225 host
209.165.201.1 time-range New_York_Minute

```

The following example shows a mixed IPv4/IPv6 ACL:

```

hostname(config)# access-list demoacl extended permit ip 2001:DB8:1::/64 10.2.2.0 255.255.255.0
hostname(config)# access-list demoacl extended permit ip 2001:DB8:1::/64 2001:DB8:2::/64
hostname(config)# access-list demoacl extended permit ip host 10.3.3.3 host 10.4.4.4

```

#### Example of Converting Addresses to Objects for Extended ACLs

The following normal ACL that does not use object groups
restricts several hosts on the inside network from accessing several web
servers. All other traffic is allowed.

```

hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp host 10.1.1.4 host 209.165.201.29 eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp host 10.1.1.78 host 209.165.201.29 eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp host 10.1.1.89 host 209.165.201.29 eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp host 10.1.1.4 host 209.165.201.16 eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp host 10.1.1.78 host 209.165.201.16 eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp host 10.1.1.89 host 209.165.201.16 eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp host 10.1.1.4 host 209.165.201.78 eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp host 10.1.1.78 host 209.165.201.78 eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp host 10.1.1.89 host 209.165.201.78 eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended permit ip any any
hostname(config)# access-group ACL_IN in interface inside

```

If you make two network object groups, one for the inside hosts,
and one for the web servers, then the configuration can be simplified and can
be easily modified to add more hosts:

```

hostname(config)# object-group network denied
hostname(config-network)# network-object host 10.1.1.4
hostname(config-network)# network-object host 10.1.1.78
hostname(config-network)# network-object host 10.1.1.89

hostname(config-network)# object-group network web
hostname(config-network)# network-object host 209.165.201.29
hostname(config-network)# network-object host 209.165.201.16
hostname(config-network)# network-object host 209.165.201.78

hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended deny tcp object-group denied object-group
web eq www
hostname(config)# access-list ACL_IN extended permit ip any any
hostname(config)# access-group ACL_IN in interface inside

```

### Configure Standard ACLs

A standard ACL is composed of all ACEs with the
same ACL ID or name. Standard ACLs are used for a limited number of features,
such as route maps or VPN filters. A standard ACL uses IPv4 addresses only, and
defines destination addresses only.

To add a standard access list entry, use the
following command:

 **access-list**access\_list\_name
 **standard**{**deny**| **permit**} {**any4**| **host***ip\_address* |
ip\_address mask }

Example:

```

hostname(config)# access-list OSPF standard permit 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0

```

The options are:

* Name—The
  access\_list\_name
   argument specifies the name of number of an ACL.
  Traditional numbers for standard ACLs are 1-99 or 1300-1999, but you can use
  any name or number. You create a new ACL if the ACL does not already exist,
  otherwise, you are adding the entry to the end of the ACL.
* Permit or Deny—The
  deny  keyword denies
  or exempts a packet if the conditions are matched. The
  permit  keyword
  permits or includes a packet if the conditions are matched.
* Destination Address—The
  any4  keyword matches
  all IPv4 addresses. The
  host
  ip\_address  argument
  matches a host IPv4 address. The
  ip\_address ip\_mask
   argument matches an IPv4 subnet, for example,
  10.1.1.0 255.255.255.0.

### Configure Webtype ACLs

Webtype ACLs are used for filtering clientless SSL
VPN traffic, constraining user access to specific networks, subnets, hosts, and
Web servers. If you do not define a filter, all connections are allowed. A
webtype ACL is composed of all ACEs with the same ACL ID or name.

With webtype ACLs, you can match traffic based on
URLs or destination addresses. A single ACE cannot mix these specifications.
The following sections explain each type of ACE.

* [Add a Webtype ACE for URL Matching](#ID-2069-000004bd)
* [Add a Webtype ACE for IP Address Matching](#ID-2069-00000511)
* [Examples for Webtype ACLs](#ID-2069-00000564)

#### Add a Webtype ACE for URL Matching

To match traffic based on the URL the user is
trying to access, use the following command;

access-list

access\_list\_name

webtype {deny |
permit}
url {url\_string |
any} [log [[level]
[interval
secs] |
disable |
default]] [time\_range

time\_range\_name] [inactive]

Example:

```

hostname(config)# access-list acl_company webtype deny url http://*.example.com

```

The options are:

* *access\_list\_name*—The name of the new or existing ACL.
  If the ACL already exists, you are adding the ACE to the end of the ACL.
* Permit or Deny—The
  deny  keyword denies
  or exempts a packet if the conditions are matched. The
  permit  keyword
  permits or includes a packet if the conditions are matched.
* URL—The
  **url** keyword specifies the URL to match.
  Use
  **url any** to match all URL-based traffic.
  Otherwise, enter a URL string, which can include wildcards. Following are some
  tips and limitations on specifying URLs:

  + Specify
    **any** to match all URLs.
  + ‘Permit url any' will allow all the URLs
    that have the format protocol://server-ip/path and will block traffic that does
    not match this pattern, such as port-forwarding. There should be an ACE to
    allow connections to the required port (port 1494 in the case of Citrix) so
    that an implicit deny does not occur.
  + Smart tunnel and ica plug-ins are not
    affected by an ACL with ‘permit url any’ because they match smart-tunnel:// and
    ica:// types only.
  + You can use these protocols: cifs://,
    citrix://, citrixs://, ftp://, http://, https://, imap4://, nfs://, pop3://,
    smart-tunnel://, and smtp://. You can also use wildcards in the protocol; for
    example, htt\* matches http and https, and an asterisk \* matches all protocols.
    For example, \*://\*.example.com matches any type URL-based traffic to the
    example.com network.
  + If you specify a smart-tunnel:// URL, you
    can include the server name only. The URL cannot contain a path. For example,
    smart-tunnel://www.example.com is acceptable, but
    smart-tunnel://www.example.com/index.html is not.
  + An asterisk \* matches none or any number
    of characters. To match any http URL, enter http://\*/\*.
  + A question mark ? matches any one
    character exactly.
  + Square brackets [] are range operators,
    matching any character in the range. For example, to match both
    http://www.cisco.com:80/ and http://www.cisco.com:81/, enter
    **http://www.cisco.com:8[01]/**.
* Logging—**log**
  arguments set logging options when an ACE matches a packet. If you enter the
  **log** option without any arguments, you
  enable syslog message 106102 at the default level (6) and for the default
  interval (300 seconds). Log options are:

  + *level*—A
    severity level between 0 and 7. The default is 6.
  + **interval***secs*—The time interval in
    seconds between syslog messages, from 1 to 600. The default is 300.
  + **disable**—Disables all ACL logging.
  + **default**—Enables logging to message 106103. This
    setting is the same as not including the
    **log** option.
* Time Range—The
  **time-range**
  *time\_range\_name* option specifies a time
  range object, which determines the times of day and days of the week in which
  the ACE is active. If you do not include a time range, the ACE is always
  active.
* Activation—Use the
  **inactive** option to disable the ACE
  without deleting it. To reenable it, enter the entire ACE without the inactive
  keyword.

#### Add a Webtype ACE for IP Address Matching

You can match traffic based on the destination address the user
is trying to access. The webtype ACL can include a mix of IPv4 and IPv6
addresses in addition to URL specifications.

To add a webtype ACE for IP address matching, use the following
command:

**access-list**access\_list\_name
webtype  {deny  |
permit }
tcp
*dest\_address\_argument* [*operator port*] [**log**
[[*level*] [**interval**
*secs*] |
**disable** |
**default**]] [time\_range
 *time\_range\_name*]] [**inactive**]]

Example:

```

hostname(config)# access-list acl_company webtype permit tcp any

```

For an explanation of keywords not explained here, see
[Add a Webtype ACE for URL Matching](#ID-2069-000004bd).
Keywords and arguments specific to this type of ACE include the following:

* **tcp**—The TCP protocol. Webtype ACLs match TCP traffic only.
* Destination Address—The
  *dest\_address\_argument*specifies the IP address to which the packet is being sent:

  + **host** *ip\_address*—Specifies an
    IPv4 host address.
  + *dest\_ip\_address mask*—Specifies an IPv4 network address and
    subnet mask, such as 10.100.10.0 255.255.255.0.
  + *ipv6-address***/***prefix-length*—Specifies
    an IPv6 host or network address and prefix.
  + **any**,
    **any4**, and
    **any6**—**any** specifies both IPv4
    and IPv6 traffic;
    **any4** specifies IPv4 traffic only; and
    **any6** specifies IPv6 traffic only.
* *operator port*—The destination port. If you do not specify
  ports, all ports are matched. The
  *port* can be the integer or name of a TCP port. The
  *operator* can be one of the following:

  + **lt**—less than
  + **gt**—greater than
  + **eq**—equal to
  + **neq**—not equal to
  + **range**—an inclusive range of values. When you use this
    operator, specify two port numbers, for example,
    **range 100
    200**.

#### Examples for Webtype ACLs

The following example shows how to
deny access to a specific company URL:

```

hostname(config)# access-list acl_company webtype deny url http://*.example.com

```

The following example shows how to
deny access to a specific web page:

```

hostname(config)# access-list acl_file webtype deny url https://www.example.com/dir/file.html

```

The following example shows how to
deny HTTP access to any URL on a specific server through port 8080:

```

hostname(config)# access-list acl_company webtype deny url http://my-server:8080/*

```

The following examples show how to
use wildcards in webtype ACLs.

* The following example matches URLs such as
  http://www.example.com/layouts/1033:

  ```

  access-list VPN-Group webtype permit url http://www.example.com/*

  ```
* The following example matches URLs such as
  http://www.example.com/ and http://www.example.net/:

  ```

  access-list test webtype permit url http://www.example.*

  ```
* The following example matches URLs such as
  http://www.example.com and ftp://wwz.example.com:

  ```

  access-list test webtype permit url *://ww?.e*co*/

  ```
* The following example matches URLs such as
  http://www.cisco.com:80 and https://www.cisco.com:81:

  ```

  access-list test webtype permit url *://ww?.c*co*:8[01]/

  ```

  The range operator “[]” in the preceding
  example specifies that either character
  **0** or
  **1** can occur at that location.
* The following example matches URLs such as
  http://www.example.com and http://www.example.net:

  ```

  access-list test webtype permit url http://www.[a-z]xample?*/

  ```

  The range operator “[]” in the preceding
  example specifies that any character in the range from
  **a** to
  **z** can occur.
* The following example matches http or https
  URLs that include “cgi” somewhere in the file name or path.

  ```

  access-list test webtype permit url htt*://*/*cgi?*

  ```

| **Note** | ---   To match any http URL, you must enter **http://\*/\*** instead of http://\*.   --- |
| --- | --- |

The following example shows how to
enforce a webtype ACL to disable access to specific CIFS shares.

In this scenario we have a root
folder named “shares” that contains two sub-folders named “Marketing\_Reports”
and “Sales\_Reports.” We want to specifically deny access to the
“shares/Marketing\_Reports” folder.

```

access-list CIFS_Avoid webtype deny url cifs://172.16.10.40/shares/Marketing_Reports.

```

However, due to the implicit “deny
all” at the end of the ACL, the above ACL makes all of the sub-folders
inaccessible (“shares/Sales\_Reports” and “shares/Marketing\_Reports”), including
the root folder (“shares”).

To fix the problem, add a new ACL to
allow access to the root folder and the remaining sub-folders:

```

access-list CIFS_Allow webtype permit url cifs://172.16.10.40/shares*

```

### Configure EtherType ACLs

EtherType ACLs apply to non-IP layer-2 traffic on bridge group
member interfaces in transparent firewall
mode. You can use these rules to permit or drop traffic based on the
EtherType value in the layer-2 packet. With EtherType ACLs, you can control the
flow of non-IP traffic across the bridge group. Note that 802.3-formatted
frames are not handled by the ACL because they use a length field as opposed to
a type field.

To add an EtherType ACE, use the following command:

access-list

access\_list\_name
ethertype
{deny |
permit}
{any |
bpdu |
dsap
hex\_address |
ipx |
isis |
mpls-multicast |
mpls-unicast |
hex\_number}

Example:

```

hostname(config)# access-list ETHER ethertype deny mpls-multicast

```

The options are:

* access\_list\_name —The name of the new
  or existing ACL. If the ACL already exists, you are adding the ACE to the end
  of the ACL.
* Permit or Deny—The
  deny  keyword
  denies a packet if the conditions are matched. The
  permit  keyword
  permits a packet if the conditions are matched.
* Traffic Matching Criteria—You can match traffic using the
  following options:

  + any —Matches all layer 2 traffic.
  + bpdu —bridge protocol data units (dsap 0x42), which
    are allowed by default.
    This keyword no longer matches
    the intended traffic. To control BPDUs, instead use
    dsap 0x42.
  + dsap
    hex\_address —The IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control
    packet's Destination Service Access Point address. Include the address you want
    to permit or deny in hexadecimal, from 0x01 to 0xff.
  + ipx —Internet Packet Exchange (IPX).
  + isis —Intermediate System to
    Intermediate System (IS-IS).
  + mpls-multicast — MPLS multicast.
  + mpls-unicast —MPLS unicast.
  + hex\_number —Any EtherType that can be identified by
    a 16-bit hexadecimal number 0x600 to 0xffff. See RFC 1700, “Assigned Numbers,”
    at http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc1700.txt for a list of EtherTypes.

* [Examples for EtherType ACLs](#ID-2069-00000616)

#### Examples for EtherType ACLs

The following examples shows how to configure EtherType ACLs,
including how to apply them to an interface.

For example, the following sample ACL allows common EtherTypes
originating on the inside interface:

```

hostname(config)# access-list ETHER ethertype permit ipx
hostname(config)# access-list ETHER ethertype permit mpls-unicast
hostname(config)# access-group ETHER in interface inside

```

The following example allows some EtherTypes through the ASA,
but it denies all others:

```

hostname(config)# access-list ETHER ethertype permit 0x1234
hostname(config)# access-list ETHER ethertype permit mpls-unicast
hostname(config)# access-group ETHER in interface inside
hostname(config)# access-group ETHER in interface outside

```

The following example denies traffic with EtherType 0x1256 but
allows all others on both interfaces:

```

hostname(config)# access-list nonIP ethertype deny 1256
hostname(config)# access-list nonIP ethertype permit any
hostname(config)# access-group nonIP in interface inside
hostname(config)# access-group nonIP in interface outside

```

## Edit ACLs in an Isolated Configuration Session

When you edit an ACL used for access rules or
any other purpose, the change is immediately implemented and impacts traffic.
With access rules, you can enable the transactional commit model to ensure that
new rules become active only after rule compilation is complete, but the
compilation happens after each ACE you edit.

If you want to further isolate the impact of
editing ACLs, you can make your changes in a “configuration session,” which is
an isolated mode that allows you to edit several ACEs and objects before
explicitly committing your changes. Thus, you can ensure that all of your
intended changes are complete before you change device behavior.

### Before you begin

* You can edit ACLs that are referenced by an
  access-group command, but you cannot edit ACLs that are referenced by any other
  command. You can also edit unreferenced ACLs or create new ones.
* You can create or edit objects and object
  groups, but if you create one in a session, you cannot edit it in the same
  session. If the object is not defined as desired, you must commit your changes
  and then edit the object, or discard the entire session and start over.
* When you edit an ACL that is referenced by
  an access-group command (access rules), the transactional commit model is used
  when you commit the session. Thus, the ACL is completely compiled before the
  new ACL replaces the old version.
* If you enable forward referencing of ACL and
  object names (the
  **forward-reference enable** command), you
  can delete an ACL that is referenced by an access-group command (access rules),
  and then recreate the ACL. When you commit changes, the new version of the ACL
  will be used after compilation is complete. You can also create rules that
  refer to objects that do not exist, or delete objects that are in use by access
  rules. However, you will get a commit error if you delete an object used by
  other rules, such as NAT.

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Start the session.  ```  hostname#configure session session_name hostname(config-s)#   ```  If the *session\_name* already exists, you open that session. Otherwise, you are creating a new session.  Use the **show configuration session** command to view the existing sessions. You can have at most 3 sessions active at a time. If you need to delete an old unused session, use the **clear configuration session** *session\_name* command.  If you cannot open an existing session because someone else is editing it, you can clear the flag that indicates the session is being edited. Do this only if you are certain the session is not actually being edited. Use the **clear session** *session\_name* **access** command to reset the flag. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Uncommitted sessions only.) Make your changes. You can use the following basic commands with any of their parameters:   * **access-list** * **object** * **object-group** |
| **Step 3** | Decide what to do with the session. The commands available depend on whether you have previously committed the session. Possible commands are:   * **exit**—To   simply exit the session without committing or discarding changes, so that you   can return later. * **commit**[**noconfirm** [**revert-save** |   **config-save**]]—(Uncommitted   sessions only.) To commit your changes. You are asked if you want to save the   session. You can save the revert session (**revert-save**), which lets you undo your changes using   the   **revert** command, or the   configuration session (**config-save**), which   includes all of the changes made in the session (allowing you to commit the   same changes again if you would like to). If you save the revert or   configuration session, the changes are committed, but the session remains   active. You can open the session and revert or recommit the changes. You can   avoid the prompt by including the   **noconfirm** option and optionally,   the desired save option. * **abort**—(Uncommitted sessions only.) To abandon your   changes and delete the session. If you want to keep the session, exit the   session and use the   **clear session**   *session\_name*   **configuration** command, which   empties the session without deleting it. * **revert**—(Committed sessions only.) To undo your   changes, returning the configuration back to what it was before you committed   the session, and delete the session. * **show   configuration session** [*session\_name*]—To show   the changes made in the session. |

---

## Monitoring ACLs

To monitor ACLs, enter one of the following commands:

* **show access-list** [*name*]—Displays the access
  lists, including the line number for each ACE and hit counts. Include an ACL
  name or you will see all access lists.
* **show running-config
  access-list** [*name*]—Displays the current running access-list
  configuration. Include an ACL name or you will see all access lists.

## History for ACLs

| Feature Name | Releases | Description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Extended, standard, webtype ACLs | 7.0(1) | ACLs are used to control network access or to specify traffic for many features to act upon. An extended access control list is used for through-the-box access control and several other features. Standard ACLs are used in route maps and VPN filters. Webtype ACLs are used in clientless SSL VPN filtering. EtherType ACLs control non-IP layer 2 traffic.  We introduced the following commands: access-list extended, access-list standard, access-list webtype, access-list ethertype. |
| Real IP addresses in extended ACLs | 8.3(1) | When using NAT or PAT, mapped addresses and ports are no longer used in an ACL for several features. You must use the real, untranslated addresses and ports for these features. Using the real address and port means that if the NAT configuration changes, you do not need to change the ACLs. |
| Support for Identity Firewall in extended ACLs | 8.4(2) | You can now use identity firewall users and groups for the source and destination. You can use an identity firewall ACL with access rules, AAA rules, and for VPN authentication.  We modified the following commands: access-list extended . |
| EtherType ACL support for IS-IS traffic | 8.4(5), 9.1(2) | In transparent firewall mode, the ASA can now control IS-IS traffic using an EtherType ACL.  We modified the following command: access-list ethertype {permit | deny} isis. |
| Support for Cisco TrustSec in extended ACLs | 9.0(1) | You can now use Cisco TrustSec security groups for the source and destination. You can use an identity firewall ACL with access rules.  We modified the following commands: access-list extended . |
| Unified extended and webtype ACLs for IPv4 and IPv6 | 9.0(1) | Extended and webtype ACLs now support IPv4 and IPv6 addresses. You can even specify a mix of IPv4 and IPv6 addresses for the source and destination. The any keyword was changed to represent IPv4 and IPv6 traffic. The any4 and any6 keywords were added to represent IPv4-only and IPv6-only traffic, respectively. The IPv6-specific ACLs are deprecated. Existing IPv6 ACLs are migrated to extended ACLs. See the release notes for more information about migration.  We modified the following commands: access-list extended , access-list webtype .  We removed the following commands: ipv6 access-list, ipv6 access-list webtype, ipv6-vpn-filter. |
| Extended ACL and object enhancement to filter ICMP traffic by ICMP code | 9.0(1) | ICMP traffic can now be permitted/denied based on ICMP code.  We introduced or modified the following commands: access-list extended ,  service-object, service. |
| Configuration session for editing ACLs and objects.  Forward referencing of objects and ACLs in access rules. | 9.3(2) | You can now edit ACLs and objects in an isolated configuration session. You can also forward reference objects and ACLs, that is, configure rules and access groups for objects or ACLs that do not yet exist.  We introduced the clear configuration session, clear session, configure session, forward-reference, and show configuration session commands. |
| ACL support for Stream Control Transmission Protocol (SCTP) | 9.5(2) | You can now create ACL rules using the sctp  protocol, including port specifications.  We modified the following command: access-list extended . |
| Ethertype rule support for the IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control packet's Destination Service Access Point address. | 9.6(2) | You can now write Ethertype access control rules for the IEEE 802.2 Logical Link Control packet's Destination Service Access Point address. Because of this addition, the bpdu  keyword no longer matches the intended traffic. Rewrite bpdu  rules for dsap 0x42 .  We modified the following commands: access-list ethertype |

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco Adaptive Security Appliance Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense Software SIP Denial of Service Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-asa-ftd-sipdos-GGwmMerC  First Published: 2021 April 28 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvw26544](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvw26544)     CVE-2021-1501     CWE-613       CVSS Score: [Base 8.6](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:N/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2021-1501     CWE-613       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-sipdos-GGwmMerC/csaf/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-sipdos-GGwmMerC.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the SIP inspection engine of Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a crash and reload of an affected device, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition.The vulnerability is due to a crash that occurs during a hash lookup for a SIP pinhole connection. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash and reload of the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-sipdos-GGwmMerC>  This advisory is part of the April 2021 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: April 2021 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74594).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software and have SIP inspection configured.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. **Determine the Device Configuration** To determine if SIP inspection is configured on Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software, use the **show service-policy | include sip** command at the CLI. The device is considered vulnerable if the output includes **Inspect: sip**, as shown in this example:  ```   device# show service-policy | include sipInspect: sip , packet 2, lock fail 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0, 5-min-pkt-rate 0 pkts/sec, v6-fail-close 0 sctp-drop-override 0    ```  **Note:** SIP inspection is enabled by default on Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software. For detailed information about the default settings for application inspection policies, see the [Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/configuration/firewall/asa-99-firewall-config/inspect-service-policy.html#ID-2094-0000026e). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there are mitigation options that apply to both physical and virtual appliances. Option 1: Disable SIP Inspection Disabling SIP inspection will completely close the attack vector for this vulnerability. However, this mitigation may not be suitable for all customers. In particular, disabling SIP inspection would break SIP connections if either Network Address Translation (NAT) is applied to SIP traffic or if any ports that are required for SIP communication are not opened through ACL.  To disable SIP inspection in Cisco ASA Software, use the following command:  ```   policy-map  class inspection_default  no inspect sip   ```  To disable SIP inspection in Cisco FTD Software, use the following command in the CLI:  ```   configure inspection sip disable   ``` Option 2: Allow Only Trusted SIP Hosts Using ACLs Use ACLs to limit SIP connection through the device to known, trusted SIP hosts. For information on Cisco ASA and FTD ACL configuration, see [Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide: Access Control Lists](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa96/configuration/firewall/asa-96-firewall-config/access-acls.html).  While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Fixed Releases In the following table(s), the left column lists Cisco software releases. The center column indicates whether a release is affected by the vulnerability described in this advisory and the first release that includes the fix for this vulnerability. The right column indicates whether a release is affected by any of the vulnerabilities described in this bundle and which release includes fixes for those vulnerabilities.  **ASA Software**       | Cisco ASA Software Release | First Fixed Release for This Vulnerability | First Fixed Release for All the Vulnerabilities Described in the Bundle of Advisories |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Earlier than 9.81 | Not vulnerable. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.8 | 9.8.4.34 | 9.8.4.35 |   | 9.9 | 9.9.2.85 | 9.9.2.85 |   | 9.101 | Migrate to a fixed release. | Migrate to a fixed release. |   | 9.12 | 9.12.4.18 | 9.12.4.18 |   | 9.13 | 9.13.1.21 | 9.13.1.21 |   | 9.14 | 9.14.2.13 | 9.14.2.13 |   | 9.15 | 9.15.1.15 | 9.15.1.15 |       1.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

# Service Policy

Service policies
using Modular Policy
Framework provide a consistent and flexible way to configure ASA features.
For example, you can use a service policy to create a timeout configuration
that is specific to a particular TCP application, as opposed to one that
applies to all TCP applications. A service policy consists of multiple actions
or rules applied to an interface or applied globally.

## About Service Policies

The following topics describe how service policies work.

* [The Components of a Service Policy](#ID-2094-0000000b)
* [Features Configured with Service Policies](#ID-2094-0000007b)
* [Feature Directionality](#ID-2094-0000011d)

* [Feature Matching for Multiple Service Policies](#ID-2094-0000022d)

### The Components of a Service Policy

The point of service policies is to apply advanced
services to the traffic you are allowing. Any traffic permitted by access rules
can have service policies applied, and thus receive special processing, such as
being redirected to a service module or having application inspection applied.

You can have these types of service policy:

* One global policy that gets applied to all
  interfaces.
* One service policy applied per interface. The
  policy can be a mix of classes for traffic going through the device and
  management traffic directed at the ASA interface rather than going through it,

Each service policy is composed of the following
elements:

1. Service policy map, which is the ordered set
   of rules, and is named on the
   service-policy command.
   In ASDM, the policy map is represented as a folder on the Service Policy Rules
   page.
2. Rules, each rule being a
   class command within the
   service policy map and the commands associated with the
   class command. In ASDM,
   each rule is shown on a separate row, and the name of the rule is the class
   name.

   The
   **class** command defines the traffic
   matching criteria for the rule.

   The commands associated with class, such as
   **inspect**,
   **set connection timeout**, and so forth,
   define the services and constraints to apply to matching traffic. Note that
   inspect commands can point to inspection policy maps, which define actions to
   apply to inspected traffic. Keep in mind that inspection policy maps are not
   the same as service policy maps.

The following example compares how service
policies appear in the CLI with how they appear in ASDM. Note that there is not
a one-to-one mapping between the figure call-outs and lines in the CLI.

The following CLI is generated by the rules shown
in the figure above.

### Features Configured with Service Policies

The following table lists the features you configure using
service policies.

Table 1. Features Configured with Service Policies

| Feature | For Through Traffic? | For Management Traffic? | See: |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Application inspection (multiple types) | **All** except RADIUS accounting | **RADIUS accounting** only | * [Getting Started with Application Layer Protocol Inspection](inspect-overview.html#ID-2093-00000004). * [Inspection of Basic Internet Protocols](inspect-basic.html#ID-2092-00000004). * [Inspection for Voice and Video Protocols](inspect-voicevideo.html#ID-2096-00000004). * [Inspection for Mobile Networks](inspect-mobile.html#ID-2095-00000004). |
| ASA FirePOWER (ASA SFR) | **Yes** | No | [ASA FirePOWER Module](access-sfr.html#ID-2123-00000004). |
| NetFlow Secure Event Logging filtering | **Yes** | **Yes** | See the NetFlow implementation guide. |
| QoS input and output policing | **Yes** | No | [Quality of Service](conns-qos.html#ID-2133-00000004). |
| QoS standard priority queue | **Yes** | No | [Quality of Service](conns-qos.html#ID-2133-00000004). |
| TCP and UDP connection limits and timeouts, and TCP sequence number randomization | **Yes** | **Yes** | [Connection Settings](conns-connlimits.html#ID-2068-00000004). |
| TCP normalization | **Yes** | No | [Connection Settings](conns-connlimits.html#ID-2068-00000004). |
| TCP state bypass | **Yes** | No | [Connection Settings](conns-connlimits.html#ID-2068-00000004). |
| User statistics for Identity Firewall | **Yes** | **Yes** | See the **user-statistics** command in the command reference. |

### Feature Directionality

Actions are applied to traffic bidirectionally or
unidirectionally depending on the feature. For features that are applied
bidirectionally, all traffic that enters or exits the interface to which you
apply the policy map is affected if the traffic matches the class map for both
directions.

| **Note** | ---   When you use a global policy, all features are unidirectional; features that are normally bidirectional when applied to a single interface only apply to the ingress of each interface when applied globally. Because the policy is applied to all interfaces, the policy will be applied in both directions so bidirectionality in this case is redundant.   --- |
| --- | --- |

For features that are applied unidirectionally,
for example QoS priority queue, only traffic that enters (or exits, depending
on the feature) the interface to which you apply the policy map is affected.
See the following table for the directionality of each feature.

Table 2. Feature Directionality

| Feature | Single Interface Direction | Global Direction |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Application inspection (multiple types) | Bidirectional | Ingress |
| ASA FirePOWER (ASA SFR) | Bidirectional | Ingress |
| NetFlow Secure Event Logging filtering | N/A | Ingress |
| QoS input policing | Ingress | Ingress |
| QoS output policing | Egress | Egress |
| QoS standard priority queue | Egress | Egress |
| TCP and UDP connection limits and timeouts, and TCP sequence number randomization | Bidirectional | Ingress |
| TCP normalization | Bidirectional | Ingress |
| TCP state bypass | Bidirectional | Ingress |
| User statistics for Identity Firewall | Bidirectional | Ingress |

### Feature Matching Within a Service Policy

A packet matches class maps in a policy map for a given
interface according to the following rules:

1. A packet can match only one class
   map in the policy map
   for each feature type.
2. When the packet matches a class map for a feature
   type, the ASA does not attempt to match it to any subsequent class
   maps for that feature
   type.
3. If the packet matches a subsequent class
   map for a different
   feature type, however, then the ASA also applies the actions for the
   subsequent class map, if supported. See
   [Incompatibility of Certain Feature Actions](#ID-2094-000001f7)
   for more information about unsupported combinations.

   | **Note** | ---   Application inspection includes multiple inspection types, and most are mutually exclusive. For inspections that can be combined, each inspection is considered to be a separate feature.   --- |
   | --- | --- |

#### Examples of Packet Matching

For example:

* If a packet matches a class map for connection
  limits, and also matches a class map for an application
  inspection, then both actions are applied.
* If a packet matches a class map for HTTP
  inspection, but also matches another class map that includes HTTP
  inspection, then the second class map actions are not
  applied.
* If a packet matches a class map for HTTP
  inspection, but also matches another class map that includes FTP
  inspection, then the second class map actions are not
  applied because HTTP and FTP inspections cannot be combined.
* If a packet matches a class map for HTTP
  inspection, but also matches another class map that includes IPv6
  inspection, then both actions are applied because the IPv6 inspection can be
  combined with any other type of inspection.

### Order in Which Multiple Feature Actions are Applied

The order in which different types of actions in a policy map are
performed is independent of the order in which the actions appear in the policy map.

Actions are performed in the following order:

1. QoS input policing
2. TCP normalization, TCP and UDP connection limits and timeouts,
   TCP sequence number randomization, and TCP state bypass.

   | **Note** | ---   When a the ASA performs a proxy service (such as AAA) or it modifies the TCP payload (such as FTP inspection), the TCP normalizer acts in dual mode, where it is applied before and after the proxy or payload modifying service.   --- |
   | --- | --- |
3. Application inspections that can be combined with other
   inspections:

   1. IPv6
   2. IP options
   3. WAAS
4. Application inspections that cannot be combined with other
   inspections. See
   [Incompatibility of Certain Feature Actions](#ID-2094-000001f7)
   for more information.
5. ASA FirePOWER (ASA SFR)
6. QoS output policing
7. QoS standard priority queue

| **Note** | ---   NetFlow Secure Event Logging filtering and User statistics for Identity Firewall are order-independent.   --- |
| --- | --- |

### Incompatibility of Certain Feature Actions

Some features are not compatible with each other for the same
traffic. The following list might not include all incompatibilities; for
information about compatibility of each feature, see the chapter or section for
the feature:

* You cannot configure QoS priority queuing and QoS policing for
  the same set of traffic.
* Most inspections should not be combined with another inspection, so the
  ASA only applies one inspection if you configure multiple inspections for the
  same traffic.
  Exceptions
  are listed in [Order in Which Multiple Feature Actions are Applied](#ID-2094-000001cf).
* You cannot configure traffic to be sent to multiple
  modules.
* HTTP inspection is not compatible with ASA FirePOWER.

| **Note** | ---   The **match default-inspection-traffic** command, which is used in the default global policy, is a special CLI shortcut to match the default ports for all inspections. When used in a policy map, this class map ensures that the correct inspection is applied to each packet, based on the destination port of the traffic. For example, when UDP traffic for port 69 reaches the ASA, then the ASA applies the TFTP inspection; when TCP traffic for port 21 arrives, then the ASA applies the FTP inspection. So in this case only, you can configure multiple inspections for the same class map. Normally, the ASA does not use the port number to determine which inspection to apply, thus giving you the flexibility to apply inspections to non-standard ports, for example.   --- |
| --- | --- |

An example of a misconfiguration is if you configure multiple
inspections in the same policy map and do not use the
default-inspection-traffic shortcut. In the first example, traffic destined to
port 21 is mistakenly configured for both FTP and HTTP inspection. In the
second example, traffic destined to port 80 is mistakenly configured for both
FTP and HTTP inspection. In both cases of misconfiguration examples, only the
FTP inspection is applied, because FTP comes before HTTP in the order of
inspections applied.

#### Example 1: Misconfiguration for FTP packets: HTTP Inspection Also Configured

```

class-map ftp
   match port tcp eq 21
class-map http
   match port tcp eq 21 [it should be 80]
policy-map test
   class ftp
     inspect ftp
   class http
     inspect http

```

#### Example 2: Misconfiguration for HTTP packets: FTP Inspection Also Configured

```

class-map ftp
   match port tcp eq 80 [it should be 21]
class-map http
   match port tcp eq 80
policy-map test
   class ftp
     inspect ftp
   class http
     inspect http

```

### Feature Matching for Multiple Service Policies

For TCP and UDP traffic (and ICMP when you enable stateful ICMP inspection), service policies operate on traffic flows, and
not just individual packets. If traffic is part of an existing connection that matches a feature in a policy on one interface,
that traffic flow cannot also match the same feature in a policy on another interface; only the first policy is used.

For example, if HTTP traffic matches a policy on the inside interface to inspect HTTP traffic, and you have a separate policy
on the outside interface for HTTP inspection, then that traffic is not also inspected on the egress of the outside interface.
Similarly, the return traffic for that connection will not be inspected by the ingress policy of the outside interface, nor
by the egress policy of the inside interface.

For traffic that is not treated as a flow, for example ICMP when you do not
enable stateful ICMP inspection, returning traffic can match a different policy map on
the returning interface.

## Guidelines for Service Policies

### Inspection Guidelines

There is a separate topic that provides detailed guidelines for
application inspection service policies. See
[Guidelines for Application Inspection](inspect-overview.html#ID-2093-000000ce).

### IPv6 Guidelines

Supports IPv6 for the following features:

* Application inspection for several, but not all, protocols. For
  details, see
  [Guidelines for Application Inspection](inspect-overview.html#ID-2093-000000ce).
* ASA FirePOWER
* NetFlow Secure Event Logging filtering
* SCTP state bypass
* TCP and UDP connection limits and timeouts, TCP sequence number
  randomization
* TCP normalization
* TCP state bypass
* User statistics for Identity Firewall

### Class Map (Traffic Class) Guidelines

The maximum number of class maps (traffic classes) of all types
is 255 in single mode or per context in multiple mode. Class maps include the
following types:

* Layer 3/4 class maps (for through traffic and management
  traffic).
* Inspection class maps
* Regular expression class maps
* match  commands used directly underneath an
  inspection policy map

This limit also includes default class maps of all types,
limiting user-configured class maps to approximately 235.

### Policy Map Guidelines

See the following guidelines for using policy maps:

* You can only assign one policy map per interface. However you
  can create up to 64 policy maps in the configuration.
* You can apply the same policy map to multiple interfaces.
* You can identify up to 63 Layer 3/4 class maps in a Layer 3/4
  policy map.
* For each class map, you can assign multiple actions from one or
  more feature types, if supported. See
  [Incompatibility of Certain Feature Actions](#ID-2094-000001f7).

### Service Policy Guidelines

* Interface service policies on ingress interfaces take precedence
  over the global service policy for a given feature. For example, if you have a
  global policy with FTP inspection, and an interface policy with TCP
  normalization, then both FTP inspection and TCP normalization are applied to
  the interface. However, if you have a global policy with FTP inspection, and an
  ingress interface policy with FTP inspection, then only the ingress interface
  policy FTP inspection is applied to that interface. If no ingress or global
  policy implements a feature, then an interface service policy on the egress
  interface that specifies the feature is applied.
* You can only apply one global policy. For example, you cannot
  create a global policy that includes feature set 1, and a separate global
  policy that includes feature set 2. All features must be included in a single
  policy.
* When you make service policy changes to the configuration, all
  *new* connections use the new service policy. Existing
  connections continue to use the policy that was configured at the time of the
  connection establishment. Output for the
  **show** command will not include data about the old
  connections.

  For example, if you remove a QoS service policy from an
  interface, then add a modified version, then the
  show service-policy  command only displays QoS
  counters associated with new connections that match the new service policy;
  existing connections on the old policy no longer show in the command output.

  To ensure that all connections use the new policy, you need to
  disconnect the current connections so they can reconnect using the new policy.
  Use the
  clear conn  or
  clear local-host  commands.

## Defaults for Service Policies

The following topics describe the default settings
for service policies and the Modular Policy Framework.

* [Default Service Policy Configuration](#ID-2094-00000270)
* [Default Class Maps (Traffic Classes)](#ID-2094-000002b1)

### Default Service Policy Configuration

By default, the configuration includes a policy
that matches all default application inspection traffic and applies certain
inspections to the traffic on all interfaces (a global policy). Not all
inspections are enabled by default. You can only apply one global policy, so if
you want to alter the global policy, you need to either edit the default policy
or disable it and apply a new one. (An interface policy overrides the global
policy for a particular feature.)

The default policy includes the following
application inspections:

* DNS
* FTP
* H323 (H225)
* H323 (RAS)
* RSH
* RTSP
* ESMTP
* SQLnet
* Skinny (SCCP)
* SunRPC
* SIP
* NetBios
* TFTP
* IP Options

The default policy configuration
includes the following commands:

```

class-map inspection_default
 match default-inspection-traffic
policy-map type inspect dns preset_dns_map
 parameters
message-length maximum client auto
message-length maximum 512
dns-guard
protocol-enforcement
nat-rewrite
policy-map global_policy
 class inspection_default
  inspect dns preset_dns_map
  inspect ftp
  inspect h323 h225 _default_h323_map
  inspect h323 ras _default_h323_map
  inspect ip-options _default_ip_options_map
  inspect netbios
  inspect rsh
  inspect rtsp
  inspect skinny
  inspect esmtp _default_esmtp_map
  inspect sqlnet
  inspect sunrpc
  inspect tftp
  inspect sip
  service-policy global_policy global

```

### Default Class Maps (Traffic Classes)

The configuration includes a default Layer 3/4
class map (traffic class) that the ASA uses in the default global policy
called
default-inspection-traffic; it matches the default inspection traffic. This class,
which is used in the default global policy, is a special shortcut to match the
default ports for all inspections.

When used in a policy, this class ensures that the
correct inspection is applied to each packet, based on the destination port of
the traffic. For example, when UDP traffic for port 69 reaches the ASA, then
the ASA applies the TFTP inspection; when TCP traffic for port 21 arrives, then
the ASA applies the FTP inspection. So in this case only, you can configure
multiple inspections for the same class map. Normally, the ASA does not use the
port number to determine which inspection to apply, thus giving you the
flexibility to apply inspections to non-standard ports, for example.

```

class-map inspection_default
 match default-inspection-traffic

```

Another class map that exists in the default
configuration is called class-default, and it matches all traffic.
This class map appears at the end of all Layer 3/4
policy maps and essentially tells the ASA to not perform any actions on all
other traffic.
You can use the class-default class if desired, rather than making your own
**match any** class map. In fact,
some features are only available for class-default.

```

class-map class-default
 match any

```

## Configure Service Policies

To configure service policies using the Modular Policy
Framework, perform the following steps:

### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Identify the traffic on which you want to act by creating Layer 3/4 class maps, as described in [Identify Traffic (Layer 3/4 Class Maps)](#ID-2094-000002ec).  For example, you might want to perform actions on all traffic that passes through the ASA; or you might only want to perform certain actions on traffic from 10.1.1.0/24 to any destination address. |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Optionally, perform additional actions on some inspection traffic.  If one of the actions you want to perform is application inspection, and you want to perform additional actions on some inspection traffic, then create an inspection policy map. The inspection policy map identifies the traffic and specifies what to do with it.  For example, you might want to drop all HTTP requests with a body length greater than 1000 bytes.  You can create a self-contained inspection policy map that identifies the traffic directly with **match** commands, or you can create an inspection class map for reuse or for more complicated matching. For example, you could match text within a inspected packets using a regular expression or a group of regular expressions (a regular expression class map), and target actions based on narrower criteria. For example, you might want to drop all HTTP requests with a URL including the text “example.com.”  See [Configure Application Layer Protocol Inspection](inspect-overview.html#ID-2093-000002d8). |
| **Step 3** | Define the actions you want to perform on each Layer 3/4 class map by creating a Layer 3/4 policy map, as described in [Define Actions (Layer 3/4 Policy Map)](#ID-2094-000003d0). |
| **Step 4** | Determine on which interfaces you want to apply the policy map, or apply it globally, as described in [Apply Actions to an Interface (Service Policy)](#ID-2094-00000475). |

* [Define Actions (Layer 3/4 Policy Map)](#ID-2094-000003d0)
* [Apply Actions to an Interface (Service Policy)](#ID-2094-00000475)

### Identify Traffic (Layer 3/4 Class Maps)

A Layer 3/4 class map identifies Layer 3 and 4 traffic to which you want to apply actions. You can create multiple Layer 3/4
class maps for each Layer 3/4 policy map.

* [Create a Layer 3/4 Class Map for Through Traffic](#ID-2094-000002ee)
* [Create a Layer 3/4 Class Map for Management Traffic](#ID-2094-0000039c)

#### Create a Layer 3/4 Class Map for Through Traffic

A Layer 3/4 class map matches traffic based on protocols, ports,
IP addresses and other Layer 3 or 4 attributes.

| **Tip** | ---   We suggest that you only inspect traffic on ports on which you expect application traffic; if you inspect all traffic, for example using **match any**, the ASA performance can be impacted.   --- |
| --- | --- |

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Create a Layer 3/4 class map: class-map class\_map\_name  Where *class\_map\_name* is a string up to 40 characters in length.  The name “class-default” is reserved. All types of class maps use the same name space, so you cannot reuse a name already used by another type of class map. The CLI enters class-map configuration mode.  Example: ```  hostname(config)# class-map all_udp   ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) Add a description to the class map.  **description** *string*  Example: ```  hostname(config-cmap)# description All UDP traffic   ``` |
| **Step 3** | Match traffic using one of the following commands. Unless otherwise specified, you can include only one match command in the class map.   * **match any**—Matches all traffic.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match any         ``` * **match**   **access-list**   *access\_list\_name*—Matches traffic specified by an extended   ACL.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list udp         ``` * match port {tcp |   udp |   sctp} {eq   port\_num |   range   port\_num   port\_num} —Matches destination ports,   either a single port or a contiguous range of ports, for the indicated   protocol. For applications that use multiple, non-contiguous ports, use the   **match access-list** command and define an ACE to match each   port.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match tcp eq 80         ``` * **match**   **default-inspection-traffic**—Matches default traffic for   inspection: the default TCP and UDP ports used by all applications that the ASA   can inspect.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match default-inspection-traffic         ```    This command, which is used in the default global policy, is a   special CLI shortcut that when used in a policy map, ensures that the correct   inspection is applied to each packet, based on the destination port of the   traffic. For example, when UDP traffic for port 69 reaches the ASA, then the   ASA applies the TFTP inspection; when TCP traffic for port 21 arrives, then the   ASA applies the FTP inspection. So in this case only, you can configure   multiple inspections for the same class map (with the exception of WAAS   inspection, which can be configured with other inspections. See   [Incompatibility of Certain Feature Actions](#ID-2094-000001f7)   for more information about combining actions). Normally, the ASA does not use   the port number to determine the inspection applied, thus giving you the   flexibility to apply inspections to non-standard ports, for example.  See   [Default Inspections and NAT Limitations](inspect-overview.html#ID-2093-000000fe)   for a list of default ports. Not all applications whose ports are included in   the   **match default-inspection-traffic** command are enabled by   default in the policy map.  You can specify a   **match access-list**command along with the   **match default-inspection-traffic** command to narrow the   matched traffic. Because the   **match default-inspection-traffic**command specifies the ports and protocols to match, any   ports and protocols in the ACL are ignored. * **match**   **dscp***value1* [*value2*] [...] [*value8*]—Matches the DSCP value in an IP header, up to eight   DSCP values.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match dscp af43 cs1 ef         ``` * **match precedence***value1* [*value2*] [*value3*] [*value4*]—Matches up to   four precedence values, represented by the TOS byte in the IP header, where the   precedence values can be 0 to 7.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match precedence 1 4         ``` * **match rtp***starting\_port range*—Matches RTP traffic, where the   *starting\_port* specifies an even-numbered UDP destination   port between 2000 and 65534. The   *range* specifies the number of additional UDP ports to match   above the   *starting\_port*, between 0 and 16383.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match rtp 4004 100         ``` * **match tunnel-group***name—*Matches VPN tunnel   group traffic to which you want to apply QoS.  You can also specify one other   **match** command to refine the traffic match. You can specify   any of the preceding commands, except for the   **match any**,   **match access-list**, or   **match default-inspection-traffic** commands. Or you can also   enter the   **match flow ip destination-address** command to match flows in   the tunnel group going to each IP address.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match tunnel-group group1   hostname(config-cmap)# match flow ip destination-address         ``` |

class-map
command:

#### Create a Layer 3/4 Class Map for Management Traffic

For management traffic to the ASA, you might want to perform
actions specific to this kind of traffic. You can specify a management class
map that can match an ACL or TCP or UDP ports. The types of actions available
for a management class map in the policy map are specialized for management
traffic.

##### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Create a management class map: class-map type management class\_map\_name  Where *class\_map\_name* is a string up to 40 characters in length.  The name “class-default” is reserved. All types of class maps use the same name space, so you cannot reuse a name already used by another type of class map. The CLI enters class-map configuration mode.  Example: ```  hostname(config)# class-map management all_udp   ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | (Optional) Add a description to the class map.  **description** *string*  Example: ```  hostname(config-cmap)# description All UDP traffic   ``` |
| **Step 3** | Match traffic using one of the following commands.   * **match**   **access-list**   *access\_list\_name*—Matches traffic specified by an extended   ACL.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list udp         ``` * match port {tcp |   udp |   sctp} {eq   port\_num |   range   port\_num   port\_num} —Matches destination ports,   either a single port or a contiguous range of ports, for the indicated   protocol. For applications that use multiple, non-contiguous ports, use the   **match access-list** command and define an ACE to match each   port.    ```      hostname(config-cmap)# match tcp eq 80         ``` |

---

### Define Actions (Layer 3/4 Policy Map)

After you configure Layer 3/4 class maps to identify traffic,
use a Layer 3/4 policy map to associate actions to those classes.

| **Tip** | ---   The maximum number of policy maps is 64, but you can only apply one policy map per interface.   --- |
| --- | --- |

#### Procedure

---

| **Step 1** | Add the policy map: policy-map policy\_map\_name  Where policy\_map\_name  is the name of the policy map, up to 40 characters in length. All types of policy maps use the same name space, so you cannot reuse a name already used by another type of policy map. The CLI enters policy-map configuration mode.  Example: ```  hostname(config)# policy-map global_policy   ``` |
| --- | --- |
| **Step 2** | Specify a previously configured Layer 3/4 class map: class class\_map\_name  Where the class\_map\_name  is the name of the class map.  See [Identify Traffic (Layer 3/4 Class Maps)](#ID-2094-000002ec) to add a class map.  Example: ```  hostname(config-pmap)# class all_http   ``` |
| **Step 3** | Specify one or more actions for this class map.  See [Features Configured with Service Policies](#ID-2094-0000007b).   | **Note** | If there is no match default-inspection-traffic  command in a class map, then at most one **inspect** command is allowed to be configured under the class. | | --- | --- | |
| **Step 4** | Repeat the process for each class map you want to include in this policy map. |

---

#### Examples

The following is an example of a
policy-map
command for a connection policy. It limits the number of connections allowed to
the web server 10.1.1.1:

```

hostname(config)# access-list http-server permit tcp any host 10.1.1.1
hostname(config)# class-map http-server
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list http-server

hostname(config)# policy-map global-policy
hostname(config-pmap)# description This policy map defines a policy concerning
connection to http server.
hostname(config-pmap)# class http-server
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection conn-max 256

```

The following example shows how multi-match works in a policy
map:

```

hostname(config)# class-map inspection_default
hostname(config-cmap)# match default-inspection-traffic
hostname(config)# class-map http_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 80

hostname(config)# policy-map outside_policy
hostname(config-pmap)# class inspection_default
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http http_map
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect sip
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection timeout idle 0:10:0

```

The following example shows how traffic matches the first
available class map, and will not match any subsequent class maps that specify
actions in the same feature domain:

```

hostname(config)# class-map telnet_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 23
hostname(config)# class-map ftp_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 21
hostname(config)# class-map tcp_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp range 1 65535
hostname(config)# class-map udp_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port udp range 0 65535
hostname(config)# policy-map global_policy
hostname(config-pmap)# class telnet_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection timeout idle 0:0:0
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection conn-max 100
hostname(config-pmap)# class ftp_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection timeout idle 0:5:0
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection conn-max 50
hostname(config-pmap)# class tcp_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection timeout idle 2:0:0
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection conn-max 2000

```

When a Telnet connection is initiated, it matches
**class telnet\_traffic**. Similarly, if an FTP connection is
initiated, it matches
**class ftp\_traffic**. For any TCP connection other than Telnet
and FTP, it will match
**class tcp\_traffic**. Even though a Telnet or FTP connection
can match
**class tcp\_traffic**, the ASA does not make this match because
they previously matched other classes.

### Apply Actions to an Interface (Service Policy)

To activate the Layer 3/4 policy map, create a
service policy that applies it to one or more interfaces or that applies it
globally to all interfaces. Use the following command:

service-policy
policy\_map\_name {global |
interface
interface\_name} [fail-close]

Where:

* *policy\_map\_name*
  is the name of the policy map.
* **global** creates a
  service policy that applies to all interfaces that do not have a specific
  policy.

  You can only apply one global policy, so if
  you want to alter the global policy, you need to either edit the default policy
  or disable it and apply a new one. By default, the configuration includes a
  global policy that matches all default application inspection traffic and
  applies inspection to the traffic globally. The default service policy includes
  the following command:
  **service-policy global\_policy global**.
* **interface**
  *interface\_name* creates a service policy
  by associating a policy map with an interface.
* **fail-close**
  generates a syslog (767001) for IPv6 traffic that is dropped by application
  inspections that do not support IPv6 traffic. By default, syslogs are not
  generated.

#### Examples

For example, the following command enables the
inbound\_policy policy map on the outside interface:

```

hostname(config)# service-policy inbound_policy interface outside

```

The following commands disable the default
global policy, and enables a new one called new\_global\_policy.

```

hostname(config)# no service-policy global_policy global
hostname(config)# service-policy new_global_policy global

```

## Monitoring Service Policies

To monitor service policies, enter the following command:

* **show service-policy**

  Displays the service policy statistics.

## Examples for Service Policies (Modular Policy Framework)

This section includes several Modular Policy Framework examples.

* [Applying Inspection and QoS Policing to HTTP Traffic](#ID-2094-00000597)
* [Applying Inspection to HTTP Traffic Globally](#ID-2094-000005ba)
* [Applying Inspection and Connection Limits to HTTP Traffic to Specific Servers](#ID-2094-000005d7)
* [Applying Inspection to HTTP Traffic with NAT](#ID-2094-00000625)

### Applying Inspection and QoS Policing to HTTP Traffic

In this example, any HTTP connection (TCP traffic
on port 80) that enters or exits the ASA through the outside interface is
classified for HTTP inspection. Any HTTP traffic that exits the outside
interface is classified for policing.

Figure 1. HTTP Inspection and QoS Policing

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/140001-150000/143001-144000/143356.ps/_jcr_content/renditions/143356.jpg)

See the following commands for this example:

```

hostname(config)# class-map http_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 80

hostname(config)# policy-map http_traffic_policy
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http
hostname(config-pmap-c)# police output 250000
hostname(config)# service-policy http_traffic_policy interface outside

```

### Applying Inspection to HTTP Traffic Globally

In this example, any HTTP connection (TCP traffic
on port 80) that enters the ASA through any interface is classified for HTTP
inspection. Because the policy is a global policy, inspection occurs only as
the traffic enters each interface.

Figure 2. Global HTTP Inspection

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/140001-150000/143001-144000/143414.ps/_jcr_content/renditions/143414.jpg)

See the following commands for this example:

```

hostname(config)# class-map http_traffic
hostname(config-cmap)# match port tcp eq 80

hostname(config)# policy-map http_traffic_policy
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_traffic
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http
hostname(config)# service-policy http_traffic_policy global

```

### Applying Inspection and Connection Limits to HTTP Traffic to Specific Servers

In this example, any HTTP connection destined for
Server A (TCP traffic on port 80) that enters the ASA through the outside
interface is classified for HTTP inspection and maximum connection limits.
Connections initiated from Server A to Host A do not match the ACL in the class
map, so they are not affected.

Any HTTP connection destined for Server B that
enters the ASA through the inside interface is classified for HTTP inspection.
Connections initiated from Server B to Host B do not match the ACL in the class
map, so they are not affected.

Figure 3. HTTP Inspection and Connection Limits to
Specific Servers

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/140001-150000/143001-144000/143357.ps/_jcr_content/renditions/143357.jpg)

See the following commands for this example:

```

hostname(config)# object network obj-192.168.1.2
hostname(config-network-object)# host 192.168.1.2
hostname(config-network-object)# nat (inside,outside) static 209.165.201.1
hostname(config)# object network obj-192.168.1.0
hostname(config-network-object)# subnet 192.168.1.0 255.255.255.0
hostname(config-network-object)# nat (inside,outside) dynamic 209.165.201.2
hostname(config)# access-list serverA extended permit tcp any host 209.165.201.1 eq 80
hostname(config)# access-list ServerB extended permit tcp any host 209.165.200.227 eq 80

hostname(config)# class-map http_serverA
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list serverA
hostname(config)# class-map http_serverB
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list serverB

hostname(config)# policy-map policy_serverA
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_serverA
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http
hostname(config-pmap-c)# set connection conn-max 100
hostname(config)# policy-map policy_serverB
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_serverB
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http

hostname(config)# service-policy policy_serverB interface inside
hostname(config)# service-policy policy_serverA interface outside

```

### Applying Inspection to HTTP Traffic with NAT

In this example, the Host on the inside network
has two addresses: one is the real IP address 192.168.1.1, and the other is a
mapped IP address used on the outside network, 209.165.200.225. You must use
the real IP address in the ACL in the class map. If you applied it to the
outside interface, you would also use the real address.

Figure 4. HTTP Inspection with NAT

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/100001-200000/140001-150000/143001-144000/143416.ps/_jcr_content/renditions/143416.jpg)

See the following commands for this example:

```

hostname(config)# object network obj-192.168.1.1
hostname(config-network-object)# host 192.168.1.1
hostname(config-network-object)# nat (VM1,outside) static 209.165.200.225

hostname(config)# access-list http_client extended permit tcp host 192.168.1.1 any eq 80

hostname(config)# class-map http_client
hostname(config-cmap)# match access-list http_client

hostname(config)# policy-map http_client
hostname(config-pmap)# class http_client
hostname(config-pmap-c)# inspect http

hostname(config)# service-policy http_client interface inside

```

| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 8.6 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 8.6 |

An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending crafted SIP traffic through an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause a crash and reload of the affected device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-asa-ftd-sipdos-GGwmMerC>  This advisory is part of the April 2021 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: April 2021 Cisco ASA, FMC, and FTD Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74594).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco products if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software and have SIP inspection configured.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. **Determine the Device Configuration** To determine if SIP inspection is configured on Cisco ASA Software or FTD Software, use the **show service-policy | include sip** command at the CLI. The device is considered vulnerable if the output includes **Inspect: sip**, as shown in this example:  ```   device# show service-policy | include sipInspect: sip , packet 2, lock fail 0, drop 0, reset-drop 0, 5-min-pkt-rate 0 pkts/sec, v6-fail-close 0 sctp-drop-override 0    ```  **Note:** SIP inspection is enabled by default on Cisco ASA Software and FTD Software. For detailed information about the default settings for application inspection policies, see the [Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa99/configuration/firewall/asa-99-firewall-config/inspect-service-policy.html#ID-2094-0000026e). Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software.  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, there are mitigation options that apply to both physical and virtual appliances. Option 1: Disable SIP Inspection Disabling SIP inspection will completely close the attack vector for this vulnerability. However, this mitigation may not be suitable for all customers. In particular, disabling SIP inspection would break SIP connections if either Network Address Translation (NAT) is applied to SIP traffic or if any ports that are required for SIP communication are not opened through ACL.  To disable SIP inspection in Cisco ASA Software, use the following command:  ```   policy-map  class inspection_default  no inspect sip   ```  To disable SIP inspection in Cisco FTD Software, use the following command in the CLI:  ```   configure inspection sip disable   ``` Option 2: Allow Only Trusted SIP Hosts Using ACLs Use ACLs to limit SIP connection through the device to known, trusted SIP hosts. For information on Cisco ASA and FTD ACL configuration, see [Cisco ASA Series Firewall CLI Configuration Guide: Access Control Lists](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/security/asa/asa96/configuration/firewall/asa-96-firewall-config/access-acls.html).  While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade.
