Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1582:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from **improper input validation** within the web UI of Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) and Cisco Cloud APIC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper input validation allows an attacker to inject malicious script code into the web UI which is then stored. This allows for the execution of arbitrary script code in the context of the web-based interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit enables the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the user's browser session.
*   **Access to Sensitive Information:** The attacker can potentially access sensitive browser-based information, such as cookies and session tokens.
*   **Content Modification:** The malicious script could potentially modify the content of the HTML page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web UI:** The vulnerability is exploited through the web UI of the Cisco APIC or Cloud APIC.
*  **Malicious Input:** An authenticated attacker can send malicious input to the web UI to inject the XSS payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid authentication credentials to access the web UI of the affected Cisco APIC or Cloud APIC.
*   **Remote Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Cisco APIC and Cisco Cloud APIC.
*   **No Workarounds:** There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability.
*   **Fixed Software:** Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability, with specific fixed releases depending on the software version.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 5.4, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, indicating medium severity.
*   **No Public Exploitation:**  At the time of the advisory, there was no known public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
*   **Acknowledgement**: Cisco thanked Adrien Peter, Pierre Milioni, and Cl√©ment Amic of Synacktiv for reporting this vulnerability.
