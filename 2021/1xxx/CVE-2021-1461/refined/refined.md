Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1461:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the improper verification of digital signatures for patch images in Cisco SD-WAN software. Specifically, the software fails to adequately validate the digital signatures of software patch images before installation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Improper Signature Verification:** The core weakness lies in the flawed implementation of the signature verification process. This allows for the possibility of bypassing the checks meant to ensure the authenticity and integrity of the software patches.
- **Bypassable Signature Checks:** The vulnerability allows attackers to circumvent the signature checks entirely, enabling them to load unverified and potentially malicious software.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Malicious Software Installation:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to install arbitrary and malicious software patches onto an affected device.
- **Device Compromise:** By loading a malicious patch, the attacker gains the ability to execute code, potentially leading to complete control over the affected device. This may include the possibility of modifying the functionality, stealing data, or disrupting operations.
- **Booting Malicious Images:** The ability to install malicious software patches could also enable an attacker to boot from a tampered image, resulting in a device running completely under the attacker's control.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Network Access:**  The vulnerability can be exploited over a network connection.
- **Software Upload:**  The attack vector involves uploading a crafted, unsigned software patch to the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker must have valid administrator-level credentials on the target Cisco SD-WAN device or system.
- **Remote Access:**  The attacker must be able to connect to the affected device remotely, usually over a network connection.
- **Software Upload Capability:** The attacker must have the ability to upload software patches to the target device.
