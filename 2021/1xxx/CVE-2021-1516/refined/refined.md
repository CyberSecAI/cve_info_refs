Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1516:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the inclusion of confidential information within HTTP requests exchanged between users and the affected Cisco devices' web-based management interface.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: Sensitive data, specifically passwords, are transmitted within HTTP requests.
- Insecure Handling of Credentials: Passwords, which should be treated with utmost confidentiality, are exposed in HTTP requests.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exposure of Sensitive Information: An attacker could potentially obtain passwords configured within the management interface.
- Unauthorized Access: Gaining access to passwords could allow an attacker to further compromise the affected device and potentially the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Network Sniffing/Interception: Attackers can capture the HTTP requests sent to the management interface, likely via network sniffing or similar methods.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated Access: The attacker requires valid credentials to access the web-based management interface.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to be able to intercept HTTP requests sent to the vulnerable device.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA)
- Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA)
- Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA)
- Devices running Cisco AsyncOS Software releases earlier than 14.0 are affected.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Cisco AsyncOS Software release 14.0 or later.
- There are no workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability, so a software update is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing by Rakshith Rajanna of Cisco.
- There are no reports of public announcements or malicious exploitation of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3, which is considered Medium severity.
- The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) for this vulnerability is CWE-540 which is "Inclusion of Sensitive Information in Source Code."

This vulnerability highlights the importance of proper handling of sensitive information in web applications and the need to protect user credentials. It also emphasizes the importance of using up-to-date software and security practices.
