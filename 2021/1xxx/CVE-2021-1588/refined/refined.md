      "Source": "Multiple",
      "Source_URL": "https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/security/advisories.html",

    },
    "Vulnerability_Description": "A vulnerability in the MPLS Operation, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) feature of Cisco NX-OS Software could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause a denial of service (DoS) condition on an affected device. This vulnerability is due to improper input validation when an affected device is processing an MPLS echo-request or echo-reply packet. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending malicious MPLS echo-request or echo-reply packets to an interface that is enabled for MPLS forwarding on the affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the MPLS OAM process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.",
    "Root_Cause": "Improper input validation when an affected device is processing an MPLS echo-request or echo-reply packet.",
    "Vulnerabilities": [
      "Improper Input Validation"
    ],
    "Impact": "A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the MPLS OAM process to crash and restart multiple times, causing the affected device to reload and resulting in a DoS condition.",
    "Attack_Vector": "The attacker must have access to the same MPLS domain as the affected device or be able to get these types of UDP packets forwarded through the MPLS network under specific network conditions. The attacker sends malicious MPLS echo-request or echo-reply packets to an interface that is enabled for MPLS forwarding on the affected device.",
    "Attacker_Capabilities": "Unauthenticated, remote attacker with the ability to send network traffic. Access to the same MPLS domain as the affected device, or ability to forward UDP packets through the MPLS network. Specifically crafted malicious MPLS echo-request/reply packets targeting port 3503.",
    "Affected_Products": [
      "Nexus 3000 Series Switches",
      "Nexus 7000 Series Switches",
       "Nexus 9000 Series Switches in standalone NX-OS mode"
    ],
        "Remediation": "Disable the MPLS OAM feature using the Cisco NX-OS CLI global configuration mode command no feature mpls oam on Nexus 3000 Series Switches and Nexus 9000 Series Switches, or by using no mpls oam on Cisco Nexus 7000 Series Switches.  Upgrade to a fixed software release."
