      "weaknesses": [
        "The vulnerability exists because ICMP and UDP responder-to-initiator flows are not inspected when the Zone-Based Policy Firewall has either Unified Threat Defense (UTD) or Application Quality of Experience (AppQoE) configured."

      "impact": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by attempting to send UDP or ICMP flows through the network. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to inject traffic through the Zone-Based Policy Firewall, resulting in traffic being dropped because it is incorrectly classified or in incorrect reporting figures being produced by high-speed logging (HSL).",

            "When the device has Zone-Based Policy Firewall configured with UTD or AppQoE and with an application layer gateway (ALG)/Alarm Interface Controller (AIC), the ALG/AIC state could be incorrectly tracked, causing the ICMP or UDP flows to break.",
            "When the device has Zone-Based Policy Firewall configured with UTD or AppQoE, a window can open in which the Zone-Based Policy Firewall idle times for the flow expire, causing the Zone-Based Policy Firewall session to be torn down while still existing in UTD. As a result, UDP flows from the responder could still be injected into the network.",
            "When the device has Zone-Based Policy Firewall configured with UTD or AppQoE and with HSL, the HSL responder data for the UDP and ICMP flows will show 0."
