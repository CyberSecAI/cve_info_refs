Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- Insufficient server-side validation of user input when sharing views in Tableau Server. Specifically, the "Share view" function doesn't properly validate the shared view's URL.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **URL Redirection to Untrusted Site (CWE-601):** The primary vulnerability is that an attacker can manipulate the URL associated with a shared view.
- The server sends an email containing a link to the attacker-controlled URL, which bypasses the typical open redirect issue (browser redirect from the Tableau server). The vulnerability manifests in the email client/webmail application rather than the Tableau server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Phishing:** The most significant impact is the potential for phishing attacks. By replacing the legitimate view URL with a link to a fake login page, an attacker can steal user credentials.
- **Loss of User Data:** Once the user enters their credentials into the fake login page, their information is sent to the attacker.
- **Trust Exploitation:** The email sent to the victim appears legitimate, originating from the Tableau server with its logo, increasing the likelihood the victim will trust the content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Interception:** The attacker needs to intercept a "Share view" POST request.
- **Request Manipulation:**  The attacker modifies the "url" parameter within the JSON payload of the POST request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker must have a valid user account on the Tableau Server site, with the capability of sharing views.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept and modify network traffic. This implies the attacker needs to be positioned on the network path of the request or have the ability to conduct a MitM attack.
- No higher privileges are required.
- The attacker must be a user on the same Tableau site as the victim.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in the "Share view" function of Tableau Server.
- The issue was initially discovered and reported by Dr. Vladimir Bostanov of SySS GmbH.
- The fix involves upgrading Tableau Server to specific versions (2019.4.18, 2020.1.14, 2020.2.11, 2020.3.7, 2020.4.3, or 2021.1).
- The vulnerability affects Tableau Server versions 2019.4-2019.4.17, 2020.1-2020.1.13, 2020.2-2020.2.10, 2020.3-2020.3.6, 2020.4-2020.4.2
- The vulnerability does not involve a direct open redirect vulnerability in the Tableau Server itself. Instead it exists in the mechanism the email client uses to render the email sent by the server.
