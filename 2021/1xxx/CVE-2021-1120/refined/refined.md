Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-1120:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA vGPU software's Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin).
- A string provided by the guest operating system (OS) is not properly null-terminated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper null termination of a string received from the guest OS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The missing null termination could lead to out-of-bounds reads, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Data Tampering:**  Improper string handling could potentially allow for modification of data in memory.
- **Unauthorized Code Execution:**  A crafted string with missing null termination could be used to overwrite memory, which could lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Denial of Service:** Memory corruption or uncontrolled execution could cause the system to become unstable and crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local.
- The guest OS sends a string to the vGPU plugin which lacks a null terminator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have local access to the guest OS running on the virtualized environment.
-  Attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable plugin by providing a specifically crafted string.
- The attacker is not able to push content to the plugin but could cause the problem by providing string with missing null terminator.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is in the Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin) component of the NVIDIA vGPU software.
- Although the guest OS supplies the faulty string, it does not have direct control over where or how the string is used within the vGPU plugin, which means the guest has no direct way to insert specific data for exploit.
- The CVSS v3.1 score is 7.0, with a vector of AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating high impacts.
