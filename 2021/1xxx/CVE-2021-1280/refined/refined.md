Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-1280:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect handling of directory search paths during the runtime of specific DLLs in Cisco Advanced Malware Protection (AMP) for Endpoints for Windows and Immunet for Windows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **DLL Hijacking:** The core vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue, where the application incorrectly searches for and loads DLL files, allowing an attacker to insert a malicious DLL.
- **Incorrect Directory Search Paths:** The applications do not properly validate or restrict the locations from where DLLs are loaded.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the targeted system.
- **SYSTEM Privileges:** The attacker gains code execution with *SYSTEM* privileges, the highest level of privilege on Windows systems. This allows the attacker to take complete control of the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Local Attack:** The attack is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the targeted Windows system.
- **Malicious DLL Placement:**  The attacker exploits this vulnerability by placing a malicious DLL file on the targeted system in a location where the vulnerable application will search for it during launch.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid Credentials:**  The attacker must have valid credentials on the Windows system to place the malicious DLL.
- **Local System Access:** The attacker requires local access to the vulnerable Windows system.

**Affected Products:**

- Cisco AMP for Endpoints for Windows releases prior to 7.3.3
- Immunet for Windows releases prior to 7.3.12

**Non-Affected Products:**
- AMP for Endpoints for Linux
- AMP for Endpoints for Mac

**Mitigation:**
- There are no workarounds, users must upgrade to the fixed versions.

**Additional Notes:**

- Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any malicious exploitation of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability was reported by multiple sources (Hou JingYi of Qihoo 360 CERT, Kyriakos Economou and Tom Wilson of ZeroPeril Ltd.).
