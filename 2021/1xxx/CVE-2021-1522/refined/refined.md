Based on the provided documents, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1522:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incomplete password policy check within the change password API of Cisco Connected Mobile Experiences (CMX). Specifically, the password policy is not fully enforced when a password is changed via the API at the server side.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Input Validation:** The core issue is a lack of proper validation of the new password against the configured strong authentication policies when processed through the API.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** This incomplete check effectively allows an authenticated user to bypass the configured strong authentication requirements by submitting a specially crafted API request.
*   **CWE-255**: Storing Credentials in a Recoverable Format. This CWE is referenced in the documents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Compromised Password Security:** A successful exploit allows a remote, authenticated attacker to set their own password to a value that does not meet the device's strong password policies.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Although not directly stated, this could potentially facilitate further attacks by making accounts easier to compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely.
*   **API Request:** The attack is carried out by sending a specifically crafted API request to the affected Cisco CMX device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be a valid, authenticated user of the Cisco CMX system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the CMX device to send the API request.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker needs knowledge of the API to craft the malicious request, although this could be reverse-engineered from public APIs.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco CMX releases 10.6.0, 10.6.1, 10.6.2, and 10.6.3 are vulnerable.
*   Cisco CMX releases 10.6.3MR1 and later contain the fix for this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*   Cisco assigned the bug ID CSCvw72659 to this vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS base score of 4.3 (Medium Severity).
*   There are no known workarounds available.
*   There is no indication of public exploitation or public announcements.
*   Cisco Security Advisory ID: cisco-sa-cmx-GkCvfd4 is related to this CVE
