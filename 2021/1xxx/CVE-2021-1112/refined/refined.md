- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability lies within the `nvmap` component of NVIDIA Linux kernel distributions. Specifically, a null pointer dereference can occur within this component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The primary vulnerability is a null pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a complete denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring local access to the system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the system, with low privileges, and no user interaction is needed to trigger the vulnerability.
