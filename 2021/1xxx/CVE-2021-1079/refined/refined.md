- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability exists in GameStream plugins of NVIDIA GeForce Experience. Log files are created using NT/System level permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure file permissions leading to potential overwrite of log files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Potential code execution, denial of service, or local privilege escalation. The attacker cannot control the consequence of the modification, nor can they leak information as a direct result of the overwrite.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
