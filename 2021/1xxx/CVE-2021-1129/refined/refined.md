Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1129:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of secure authentication token enforcement when accessing the general purpose APIs of Cisco Email Security Appliance (ESA), Cisco Content Security Management Appliance (SMA), and Cisco Web Security Appliance (WSA).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The primary weakness is the absence of a required authentication mechanism for the general-purpose API. This allows unauthorized access to the API.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The lack of authentication leads to an information disclosure vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Information Disclosure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to obtain sensitive system information and certain configuration data from the affected device. This can be further used for reconnaissance or other malicious activities.
*   **Confidentiality Impact:** The primary impact is on confidentiality, as an attacker can access information that should be protected. There is no impact on Integrity or Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote, Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over a network.
*   **Crafted API Requests:** An attacker exploits this vulnerability by sending specially crafted requests to the vulnerable general-purpose API endpoint on the affected appliance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker does not need prior authentication and can be located anywhere on the network that has access to the vulnerable appliance.
*   **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to reach the API endpoint on the vulnerable appliance.

**Additional Notes**

*   The affected products are Cisco ESA, SMA, and WSA if they support the general-purpose API and have a software release earlier than the first fixed release.
*   The general purpose API was first supported in ESA release 13.0, SMA release 12.5, and WSA release 11.8
*   There are no workarounds to mitigate the vulnerability.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address this issue.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability has a base CVSS score of 5.3 (Medium).
