Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1091:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the NVIDIA GPU Display driver for Windows allowing an unprivileged user to create a hard link to a file. This hard link then allows the driver to overwrite a file that requires elevated privileges for modification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper file handling and permission checks within the NVIDIA GPU Display driver.
- The ability for an unprivileged user to manipulate file system hard links to gain elevated access and modify protected files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Data Loss:** Overwriting a critical system file could lead to loss of data.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Overwriting necessary files can cause system instability or prevent the OS from booting properly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required, and an attacker needs to be able to create a file hard link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be a local, unprivileged user on the Windows system.
- The attacker needs to be able to create file hard links, which is a capability that exists for a local user.
