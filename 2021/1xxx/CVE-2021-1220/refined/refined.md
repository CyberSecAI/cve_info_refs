Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1220:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerabilities are due to insufficient error handling in the web UI of Cisco IOS XE Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- Insufficient error handling in the web UI.
- Vulnerable web UI software in Cisco IOS XE.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Denial of Service (DoS) condition: The web UI software becomes unresponsive.
- Consumption of all available vty lines, preventing new session establishment.
- Manual intervention is required to restore web UI and vty session functionality.
- While the console connection is not affected, the web UI and vty sessions will be unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- Remote attack.
- Sending crafted HTTP packets to an affected device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Authenticated attacker with read-only privileges.
- Remote network access to the affected device with the HTTP server feature enabled.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted HTTP packets, which indicates a lack of input sanitization or validation within the web UI.
- The consumption of vty lines and unresponsiveness of the web UI suggest a resource exhaustion vulnerability is present.
- Disabling the HTTP server feature is listed as a mitigation, which will eliminate the attack vector, but also disables the web UI completely.
- The vulnerability is specific to Cisco IOS XE Software and does not affect other Cisco products.
- Cisco has released software updates to address these vulnerabilities.
- Unexpected idle vty sessions are an indicator of compromise. The "show user" command can be used to identify these sessions, which will be listed with the host(s) as HTTP CP if the attack has persisted.
