- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the vGPU plugin allowing guests to allocate resources for which they are not authorized.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**  Improper authorization, leading to unauthorized resource allocation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation can lead to integrity and confidentiality loss, denial of service, or information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access from a guest operating system within a virtualized environment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  The attacker needs to be a local user within a guest operating system that has access to the vulnerable vGPU plugin.
