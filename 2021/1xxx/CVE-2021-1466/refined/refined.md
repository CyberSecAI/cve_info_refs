Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1466:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from incomplete bounds checks on data provided to the `vDaemon` service within Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Overflow:** The lack of proper bounds checking allows an attacker to send specially crafted, oversized data to the `vDaemon` service, leading to a buffer overflow.
*   **Improper Input Validation:** The system fails to adequately validate the size or structure of the input data before processing it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  A successful exploit results in a buffer overflow, which can cause the `vDaemon` service to crash and reload, leading to a denial of service condition on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The attacker sends malicious data to the `vDaemon` service over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Local Attacker:** The attacker needs to be authenticated and have local access to send the malicious data to the `vDaemon` service. This suggests the attacker would have to already have access to the network/system in some way.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Cisco has released software updates to address this vulnerability.
*   There are no known workarounds to mitigate the issue apart from updating to a fixed software version.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
*   The advisory is classified as having a **Medium** severity.

**Affected Products:**

*   Cisco SD-WAN vManage Software releases prior to versions 18.4.5, 19.2.3, 20.1.12, 20.3.1, and 20.4.1.

**CVSS Score:**

*   **Base Score:** 5.4
*   **Vector String:** CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:L
