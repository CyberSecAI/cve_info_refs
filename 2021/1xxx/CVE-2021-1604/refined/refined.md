Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1604:

**1. Verification:**

*   The provided content includes a Cisco Security Advisory that explicitly mentions CVE-2021-1604, along with other related CVEs (CVE-2021-1603, CVE-2021-1605, CVE-2021-1606, CVE-2021-1607).
*   The advisory indicates that these vulnerabilities are related to stored cross-site scripting (XSS) in the Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). This aligns with the vulnerability described in the text.

**2. Root Cause:**

*   The root cause is insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE. This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject malicious code into the interface.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the presence of stored XSS flaws in the Cisco ISE web management interface.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to:
    *   Execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected web interface.
    *   Access sensitive, browser-based information (e.g., cookies, session tokens).
    *   Potentially take over the user's session.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based. The attacker injects the malicious code through the web interface.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Remote Attacker:** The attacker must have valid administrative credentials for the Cisco ISE system to exploit this vulnerability. This highlights a privilege escalation scenario, where a lower-privileged account could be exploited after a more privileged account makes an injection.

**Additional Notes:**

*   **Affected Products:**  Cisco ISE releases earlier than 2.6 Patch 9, 2.7 Patch 4, and 3.0 Patch 3 are vulnerable.
*   **Fix:** Cisco has released software updates to address these vulnerabilities (2.6 Patch 9 and later, 2.7 Patch 4 and later, 3.0 Patch 3 and later).
*   **Workaround:**  There are no workarounds available.
*   **CVSS Score:** The advisory lists a CVSS base score of 4.8 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N). The CVSS vector provides additional detail, showing network attack vector, low attack complexity, high privileges required, user interaction is required, and the scope is changed.
*   **CWE:** The Common Weakness Enumeration (CWE) associated with this vulnerability is CWE-79 (Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation)
*   **Reporting:** Cisco acknowledges Alexander Polce Leary of AIG for reporting CVE-2021-1603, while the other vulnerabilities were found during a Cisco TAC support case.

**Summary of CVE-2021-1604:**

The vulnerability is a stored XSS issue in the Cisco ISE web interface, stemming from a failure to validate user-supplied input. It can allow a remote, authenticated attacker to inject malicious scripts, leading to arbitrary code execution in the context of the browser, potentially compromising sensitive information. The vulnerability requires administrative privileges for exploitation.
