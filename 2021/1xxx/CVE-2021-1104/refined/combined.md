# Video: Glitching RISC-V chips: MTVEC corruption for hardening ISA | Adam Zabrocki and Alex Matrosov, DEF CON 29

By [RISC-V Community News](https://riscv.org/author/inthenews/ "Posts by RISC-V Community News")August 9, 2021[No Comments](https://riscv.org/ecosystem-news/2021/08/video-glitching-risc-v-chips-mtvec-corruption-for-hardening-isa-adam-zabrocki-and-alex-matrosov-def-con-29/#respond)

Presentation Summary: RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) provided under open-source licenses that do not require fees to use. ISA is based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. RISC-V has features to increase computer speed, while reducing cost and power use.

Many industry players like Google, IBM, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Samsung are members of the RISC-V Foundation and have long supported RISC-V development. In 2016, NVIDIA unveiled plans to replace the internal microcontrollers of their graphic cards with next-gen RISC-V-based controllers built for upcoming NVIDIA GPUs.

NVIDIA’s Product Security undertook a detailed architectural analysis and research of the RISC-V IP, discovering a potential risk with the ambiguous specification of the Machine Trap Base Address (MTVEC) register. This ambiguity leads to potential fault injection vulnerabilities under physical attack models.
