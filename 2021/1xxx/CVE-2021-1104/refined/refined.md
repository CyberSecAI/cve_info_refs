The provided content discusses a potential vulnerability related to the RISC-V architecture, specifically concerning the Machine Trap Base Address (MTVEC) register. This aligns with the general area of potential hardware vulnerabilities that CVE-2021-1104 might cover. Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the ambiguous specification of the Machine Trap Base Address (MTVEC) register in the RISC-V Instruction Set Architecture (ISA). This ambiguity can be exploited using fault injection techniques, a type of physical attack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a fault injection vulnerability. The ambiguity in the MTVEC register specification can be exploited to cause unintended behavior in the system by manipulating the register's value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to control-flow hijacking by corrupting the MTVEC, which determines the address of the exception handler. This can lead to arbitrary code execution and other potential impacts depending on the specific system's design and what is accessible to the attacker.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is physical fault injection. This means that an attacker needs physical access to the device and the capability to inject faults/glitches into the chip's operation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires physical access to the device and the capability to perform fault injection attacks. This would necessitate specialized hardware and a deep understanding of the chip's architecture and potential fault injection points.
