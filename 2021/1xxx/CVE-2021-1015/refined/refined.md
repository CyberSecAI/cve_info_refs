  "CVE-2021-1015": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability arises from insufficient permission checks in `getDeviceIdWithFeature`, `getMeidForSlot`, and `getNetworkTypeForSubscriber` methods within `PhoneInterfaceManager`. These methods allow an app to query information about installed applications on a device without requiring the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
      "Improper access control",
      "Information disclosure"
    ],
    "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to query which applications are installed on a device without having the necessary permissions. This could lead to the attacker gathering sensitive information about the device and its users.",
    "Attack vectors": "An app can call the affected methods within `PhoneInterfaceManager` without holding the `QUERY_ALL_PACKAGES` permission.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have a malicious application installed on the device."
