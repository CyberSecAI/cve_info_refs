**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions applied during the execution of a specific command in the Cisco IOS XR Software CLI parser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The CLI parser does not properly enforce privilege levels when executing a certain command, allowing authenticated users to potentially access more information than intended.
*   **Information Disclosure:** The specific command, when exploited, can reveal sensitive configuration information that should not be accessible to the user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker who has successfully authenticated and has local access can gain unauthorized access to sensitive configuration data.
*   The information disclosed may include details that could potentially be used for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device to execute the vulnerable command on the command line.
*   **Specific Command:** The vulnerability is triggered by using a specific command at the command line.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the system.
*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have local access to the device or system to use the command line interface.
