| **CVE IDs** | **Description** | **Base Score** | **Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| CVE‑2021‑1074 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver installer contains a vulnerability where an attacker with local unprivileged system access may be able to replace an application resource with malicious files. This attack requires a user with system administration rights to execute the installer and requires the attacker to replace the files in a very short time window between file integrity validation and execution. Such an attack may lead to code execution, escalation of privileges, denial of service, and information disclosure. | 7.3 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| CVE‑2021‑1075 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver for Windows contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) handler for DxgkDdiEscape where the program dereferences a pointer that contains a location for memory that is no longer valid, which may lead to code execution, denial of service, or escalation of privileges. An attacker does not have any control over the information and may conduct only limited data modification. | 7.3 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:C/C:N/I:L/A:H) |
| CVE‑2021‑1076 | NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys` or `nvidia.ko`) where improper access control may lead to denial of service, information disclosure, or data corruption. | 6.6 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H) |
| CVE‑2021‑1077 | NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux contains a vulnerability where the software uses a reference count to manage a resource that is incorrectly updated, which may lead to denial of service. | 6.6 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H) |
| CVE‑2021‑1078 | NVIDIA Windows GPU Display Driver for Windows contains a vulnerability in the kernel driver (`nvlddmkm.sys`) where a NULL pointer dereference may lead to system crash. | 5.5 | [AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln-metrics/cvss/v3-calculator?vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) |
