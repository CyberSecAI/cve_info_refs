Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1603:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of this vulnerability is insufficient validation of user-supplied input within the web-based management interface of Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE). This lack of validation allows an attacker to inject malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS flaw, which means the malicious code can be persistently stored within the application and executed when other users access the affected area. The injected script is stored within the web-based management interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary script code within the context of the affected interface.
*   **Sensitive Information Access:** The attacker could potentially access sensitive, browser-based information, including cookies or session tokens.
*   **Potential Account Compromise:** By stealing session information, an attacker could hijack a user's session and potentially take over their account.
*   **HTML page manipulation**: Attackers may be able to rewrite the content of the HTML page.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The attack is conducted remotely.
*   **Web-Based Interface:** The vulnerability exists within the web-based management interface of Cisco ISE.
*   **Malicious Code Injection:** The attacker injects malicious code into specific pages of the interface, exploiting the lack of input validation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to possess valid administrative credentials to exploit the vulnerability. This means they need to be an authenticated user with administrative privileges.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Cisco ISE releases earlier than: 2.6 Patch 9, 2.7 Patch 4, and 3.0 Patch 3.
*   There are no known workarounds.
*   The issue was reported by Alexander Polce Leary of AIG. Other related vulnerabilities in the advisory (CVE-2021-1604, CVE-2021-1605, CVE-2021-1606, CVE-2021-1607) were found during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
*   Cisco has released software updates to address these vulnerabilities.

The information provided is consistent with the typical understanding of a stored XSS vulnerability, offering details on how the attack is carried out, its impact and the necessary preconditions for exploitation, exceeding the description from a typical CVE.
