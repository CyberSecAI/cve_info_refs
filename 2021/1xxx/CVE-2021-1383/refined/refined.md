    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided documents contain information about CVE-2021-1383, a vulnerability affecting Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN software. The vulnerability stems from insufficient input validation, allowing parameter injection into CLI commands, leading to local privilege escalation. An authenticated, local attacker can exploit this vulnerability.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation of certain CLI commands, allowing parameter injection.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "CWE-20: Improper Input Validation",
        "Parameter injection vulnerability"
      ],
      "impact": "An authenticated, local attacker can gain root privileges on the underlying operating system.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Local access to the Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN software CLI.",
        "Parameter injection within SD-WAN wrapping commands."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must have valid credentials for an administrative user account on the affected Cisco IOS XE SD-WAN software. Local access to the device's CLI is required.",
      "additional_details": "By injecting parameters within the sdwan wrapping commands on IOS-XE CLI, the attacker gains access to a confd CLI in 'show mode'. The attacker can then leverage the 'vshell' command to obtain a shell as binos, leading to local privilege escalation via trivial methods such as `telnet 127.0.0.1`. The Cisco Security Advisory also mentions that a related vulnerability was discovered by Cisco during internal testing (CVE-2021-1454). The advisory provides affected versions, fixed software, and notes about no workarounds."
