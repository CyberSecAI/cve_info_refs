The provided content is related to CVE-2021-1083.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the NVIDIA vGPU software, specifically in the guest kernel mode driver and Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin). It arises from a lack of validation of input length.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Input length is not validated in the guest kernel mode driver and Virtual GPU Manager (vGPU plugin).
- This lack of validation can be exploited to trigger other issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to:
- Information disclosure
- Tampering of data
- Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is local, with the attacker needing only low privileges.
Attack vector is local (AV:L), with low complexity (AC:L), low privileges are required (PR:L), no user interaction is required (UI:N) and the scope is unchanged (S:U).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system.
- Low privileges.
