Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1236:

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-1236 describes a vulnerability in the Snort application detection engine that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to bypass configured security policies. This vulnerability stems from a flaw in Snort's detection algorithm.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a flaw in the Snort application detection engine's algorithm. This flaw allows specially crafted packets to bypass the configured policies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Policy Bypass:** The core weakness is the ability of an attacker to bypass security policies defined in Snort.
- **Flawed Detection Algorithm:** The underlying issue is within the detection algorithm of the Snort engine.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Policy Bypass:** Successful exploitation allows attackers to bypass security policies, potentially leading to unauthorized access or malicious activity within a network.
- **Malicious Payload Delivery:** An attacker can deliver malicious payloads to a protected network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending specially crafted packets over the network.
- **Remote:** An unauthenticated remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send crafted packets to a vulnerable system.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication to exploit the vulnerability.
