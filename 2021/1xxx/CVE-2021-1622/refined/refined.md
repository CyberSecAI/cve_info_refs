  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-1622",
    "description": "A vulnerability in the Common Open Policy Service (COPS) of Cisco IOS XE Software for Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to cause resource exhaustion, resulting in a denial of service (DoS) condition. This vulnerability is due to a deadlock condition in the code when processing COPS packets under certain conditions. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by sending COPS packets with high burst rates to an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to cause the CPU to consume excessive resources, which prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources and results in a DoS.",
    "affected_products": "Cisco cBR-8 Converged Broadband Routers running Cisco IOS XE Software earlier than Release 16.12.1z1 or Release 17.3.1x with COPS enabled.",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A deadlock condition occurs in the code when processing COPS packets under specific conditions.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Deadlock condition when processing COPS packets.",
         "Lack of proper resource management when handling COPS packets."
       ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation leads to resource exhaustion, specifically excessive CPU consumption, causing a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. This prevents other control plane processes from obtaining resources.",
      "attack_vectors": "Remote, unauthenticated attacker can send COPS packets with high burst rates to trigger the deadlock.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send network traffic to the vulnerable device on the COPS port (TCP 2126 or 3918). The attacker does not need to be authenticated."
    },
    "remediation": "Upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Software Release 16.12.1z1 or 17.3.1x, or later. While there are no workarounds, mitigations exist: configure the device to only process packets from trusted COPS servers, or to drop all COPS packets. Lowering COPS server keep-alive setting may minimize the impact, but not remove the vulnerability."
