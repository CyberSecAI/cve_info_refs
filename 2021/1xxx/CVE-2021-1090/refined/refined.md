Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1090:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the kernel mode layer (`nvlddmkm.sys`) of the NVIDIA GPU Display Driver for Windows and Linux.
- Specifically, the issue occurs in the handler for control calls.
- The software reads or writes to a buffer by using an index or pointer that references a memory location after the end of the buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write or read, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Data tampering (modification of data).
- Denial of Service (system instability or crash).

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access to the system.
- The attacker needs to have low privileges.
- No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided Gentoo security advisory (GLSA 202310-02) confirms that this CVE affects the NVIDIA drivers and includes it in a list of multiple vulnerabilities.
- The Gentoo advisory also states that the vulnerability could lead to root privilege escalation, which is a more severe impact than just data tampering or denial of service. However, the specific vector for this escalation is not given and might be related to other vulnerabilities.
- The affected driver component is `nvlddmkm.sys`.
- The vulnerability affects both Windows and Linux systems.
