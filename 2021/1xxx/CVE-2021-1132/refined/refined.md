Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper input validation in the web-management interface and certain HTTP-based APIs of Cisco Network Services Orchestrator (NSO). Specifically, the system fails to adequately sanitize user-supplied input containing directory traversal character sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal flaw, where an attacker can manipulate input to access files and directories outside of the intended web server root.
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The web interface and HTTP-based APIs lack proper validation of user-supplied input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to access sensitive files on the affected system. This may include configuration files, logs, or other data that could aid in further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted HTTP Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted HTTP request.
- **Directory Traversal Sequences:** The crafted requests contain directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) that the vulnerable software processes improperly, allowing the attacker to navigate the filesystem.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote, Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability remotely without requiring prior authentication to the system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected Cisco NSO system.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco NSO releases 5.3 and 5.4 are vulnerable. Specifically:
   - NSO Release 5.3 is vulnerable before 5.3.3
   - NSO Release 5.4 is vulnerable before 5.4.1
- NSO releases 5.2 and earlier are not vulnerable.

**Mitigation:**
- Cisco has released software updates to address the vulnerability.
    - Upgrade to NSO release 5.3.3 or later if running 5.3.
    - Upgrade to NSO release 5.4.1 or later if running 5.4.
- There are no known workarounds to mitigate this vulnerability other than upgrading.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was found during internal security testing.
- The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of the vulnerability that is described in this advisory.
- The vulnerability has a base CVSS v3.1 score of 5.3 (Medium severity) with the vector: `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N`
