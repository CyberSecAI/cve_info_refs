Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-1369

**Description:**
A vulnerability exists in the REST API of Cisco Firepower Device Manager (FDM) On-Box Software. This vulnerability could allow an authenticated, remote attacker to gain read and write access to information that is stored on an affected device.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is due to the improper handling of XML External Entity (XXE) entries when parsing certain XML files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **XML External Entity (XXE) Injection:** The software improperly processes XML input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious XML entities. This allows the attacker to make the server read local files or internal resources which are not intended to be exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could retrieve files from the local system, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Partial Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploitation could lead to a partial denial-of-service condition on the affected device.
- **Read/Write Access:** An attacker can gain read and write access to data on the vulnerable device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.
- **Malicious Requests:** The attacker sends malicious requests containing specially crafted XML entities.
- **REST API:** The vulnerability is present in the REST API of Cisco FDM On-Box Software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the affected device.

**Affected Products:**
- Cisco FDM On-Box Software releases earlier than 6.5.0.5, 6.6.3, and 6.7.0 are vulnerable.
- Cisco Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA) Software and Cisco Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software are not affected.

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Cisco FDM On-Box Software releases 6.5.0.5, 6.6.4, 6.7.0, or later which contain the fix for this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was discovered during internal security testing.
- There are no workarounds available to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is rated as medium severity, with a base CVSS score of 5.4.
