Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-1315:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Improper validation of user-supplied input in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV series routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The vulnerability allows an authenticated, remote attacker to inject arbitrary commands that are executed with root privileges on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code as the root user on the affected device. This could result in complete compromise of the device, including but not limited to data exfiltration, malware deployment, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attacker sends crafted HTTP requests to the targeted device's web-based management interface.
*   Exploitation can be done remotely if the "remote management" feature is enabled on the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials on the targeted Cisco Small Business RV router.
*   The web management interface must be accessible to the attacker, either locally or remotely. The remote management feature is disabled by default.

**Additional details:**

*   The advisory mentions that no workarounds address these command injection vulnerabilities.
*   The vulnerable products include: Cisco Small Business RV016, RV042, RV042G, RV082, RV320, and RV325 Routers with specific vulnerable firmware versions.
*   Cisco has released software updates for RV320 and RV325 routers to address this, but it's also noted that Cisco will not be releasing firmware updates for  RV016, RV042, RV042G, and RV082 due to the end-of-life status of those devices. It's suggested those users migrate to Cisco Small Business RV340 Dual WAN Gigabit VPN Router.
*   The vulnerability is tracked using Cisco Bug ID `CSCvv97022` .
*   The CVSS base score is 7.2 with High Severity.
