Based on the provided documents, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-1620:

**Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a failure in the Internet Key Exchange Version 2 (IKEv2) AutoReconnect feature within Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software. Specifically, the code doesn't properly release allocated IP addresses from the local pool under certain error conditions during connection attempts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Resource Exhaustion:** The core issue is the improper management of IP addresses within the IKEv2 AutoReconnect feature. The failure to release these addresses upon certain failed connection attempts leads to their exhaustion over time.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):**  An attacker who successfully exploits this vulnerability can consume all available IP addresses from the local pool. This exhaustion will prevent legitimate users from establishing new connections, leading to a DoS condition.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Exploitation:** A remote, authenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Non-AnyConnect Clients:** Exploitation is possible by trying to connect using a non-AnyConnect client.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user to trigger the vulnerability by attempting connections with non-AnyConnect clients.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable Cisco device with the IKEv2 AutoReconnect feature enabled.

**Additional Details:**
*   The IKEv2 AutoReconnect feature is not enabled by default. It has to be manually configured.
*   There are no workarounds that fully address this vulnerability. Cisco recommends removing the “reconnect timeout” command and reloading the device until an upgrade is performed to mitigate the risk.
* The only way to recover an exhausted IP address pool is to reload the device.
*   Cisco is not aware of any public announcements or active exploitation of the vulnerability.
*   This vulnerability was discovered during the resolution of a Cisco TAC support case.
