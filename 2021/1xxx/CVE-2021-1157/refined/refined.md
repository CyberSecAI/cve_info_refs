Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-1157:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance:**

The content from `sec.cloudapps.cisco.com_9c14fe5d_20250115_113009.html` and `tools.cisco.com_042426ee_20250114_184119.html` explicitly mentions CVE-2021-1157 as one of multiple vulnerabilities present in the web-based management interface of Cisco Small Business RV110W, RV130, RV130W, and RV215W Routers. The CSAF document also confirms the presence of CVE-2021-1157. Therefore, the content is related to this CVE.

**2. Root cause of vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is insufficient input validation by the web-based management interface of the affected Cisco Small Business routers.

**3. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
   - Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability is present.
   - The web management interface does not properly sanitize user-provided input.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**
   - A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary script code in the context of the affected interface.
   - Attackers may gain access to sensitive, browser-based information, such as cookies or session tokens.

**5. Attack vectors:**
   - The attacker can exploit the vulnerability by sending crafted HTTP requests to the affected device's web-based management interface.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to have valid administrator credentials on the affected device to exploit this vulnerability.
   - The attacker can be remote if the "remote management" feature on the router is enabled.
   - The web-based management interface can be accessed via LAN or WAN depending on the configuration.
   - The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting HTTP requests, which does not require direct access to the device.

**Additional Notes:**

*   Cisco has stated that they will not be releasing software updates for this vulnerability due to the affected products having reached their end-of-life. Users are advised to migrate to other models.
*   The provided CVSS score for this vulnerability is 4.8 (Medium severity).
*   The advisory mentions multiple other CVEs that affect the same products, indicating a series of similar vulnerabilities.
* The OWASP content provides detailed information about XSS vulnerabilities in general, including reflected and stored XSS attacks, which is relevant for understanding the nature of the vulnerability.

In summary, the vulnerability is a stored XSS in the web management interface that can be exploited by authenticated remote administrators by crafting HTTP requests that inject malicious scripts into the interface.
