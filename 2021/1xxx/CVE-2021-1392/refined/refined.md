# Relevant Content for CVE-2021-1392

Based on the provided documents, here's the extracted information relevant to CVE-2021-1392:

**1. CVE Description (from cisco advisory)**

*   **Vulnerability:** Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Common Industrial Protocol Privilege Escalation Vulnerability.
*  **Root Cause:** Incorrect permissions are associated with the `show cip security` CLI command.
*  **Weakness:**  An authenticated, local attacker can retrieve the password for Common Industrial Protocol (CIP).
*   **Impact:** An attacker can remotely configure the device as an administrative user by exploiting this vulnerability after retrieving the CIP password.
*   **Attack Vector:** Local access to the affected device CLI is required.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires valid credentials to authenticate to the CLI.

**2. Additional Details (from cisco advisory)**

*   **Affected Products:** Cisco devices running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software with CIP enabled. CIP is not enabled by default.
*   **Determining if CIP is Enabled:** Use the `show cip status` command. If output shows `State : Enabled`, the device is vulnerable.
*  **Workarounds:** Disabling CIP with `no cip enable` command on the interface configuration mode for the VLAN that CIP is currently enabled on. Also by using TACACS+ authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) command authorization for only admin users
* **Fix:** Apply software updates provided by Cisco. The advisory notes the vulnerability was addressed in the March 2021 bundled publication.
*   **Exploitation:**  Cisco PSIRT is not aware of any public announcements or malicious use of this vulnerability.

**3. Technical Details (from cisco advisory)**

*   **Affected Command:** The `show cip security` CLI command is vulnerable
*   **Vulnerability:** By issuing the command, an attacker can retrieve the password for CIP

**4.  Mitigation (from cisco advisory)**

*   Disabling the CIP feature eliminates the attack vector.
*   Using TACACS+ AAA with command authorization to restrict access to the `show cip security` command.

**5.  Additional Information (from release notes)**
* Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.0SG introduced new software features including the ability to create 2-way Community Private VLANs
* Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.0SG also included the ability to propagate Location Info over CDP and to support 32k mroutes.

**6. Related Bugs (from release notes):**

*   CSCti26172 - message displays "The policymap <policy-map name> is already attached to control-plane and cannot be shared with other targets" - define a policy-map with a different name and reattach.
*   CSCtl06706 - When either the RADIUS-server test feature or RADIUS-erver dead-criteria is configured and either RADIUS-server deadtime is not configured or is set to 0, the RADIUS-server status is not properly relayed to AAA. Configure both dead-criteria and deadtime.

**7. Software Checker information (from cisco website)**

* Cisco has provided the Cisco Software Checker to allow users to enter the output of show version, a list of specific releases or select from a list of releases and narrow the search by impact (critical, high, medium, low or informational) or by a Cisco Security Advisory. The software checker provides the earliest fix, the first fixed, and the combined first fixed versions.
