> ## **Cisco IOS Software Packaging for IOS 3.2.xSG**
>
> The Enterprise Services image supports all Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series software features based on Cisco IOS Software, including enhanced routing.
>
> The IP Base image supports Open Shortest Path First (OSPF) for Routed Access and Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol (EIGRP) "limited" Stub Routing, and RIPv1/v2. The IP Base image does not support enhanced routing features such as Nonstop Forwarding/Stateful Switchover (NSF/SSO), BGP, Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS), Internetwork Packet Exchange (IPX), AppleTalk, Virtual Routing Forwarding (VRF-lite), GLBP, and policy-based routing (PBR).
>
> LAN Base image is primarily focused on customer access and Layer 2 requirements and therefore many of the IP Base features are not required. The IP upgrade image is available if at a later date you require some of those features.
>
> Starting with Cisco IOS XE 3.2.0SG, support for HSRP v2 IPV6 has been extended from Enterprise Services to IP Base.

## Cisco IOS XE to Cisco IOS Version Number Mapping

As [Table 8](/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#47795) shows, each version of Cisco IOS XE has an associated Cisco IOS version:

Table 8 Cisco IOS XE to Cisco IOS Version Number Mapping

| Cisco IOS XE Version | Cisco IOS Version |
| --- | --- |
| 03.1.0SG | 15.0(1)XO |
| 03.1.1SG | 15.0(1)XO1 |
| 03.2.0SG | 15.0(2)SG |

## Upgrading the System Software

If you are upgrading to 3.2.0SG, you must upgrade your ROMMON to 15.0(1r)SG2.

You can upgrade a ROMMON image either through a console or telnet.

If they have dual supervisors, first upgrade your software to 3.2.0SG, then upgrade your ROMMON to 15.0(1r)SG2 to avoid the resets uplinks issue (CSCtj54375).

### Identifying an +E Chassis and ROMMON

An +E chassis is identified by a FRU minor value in the chassis' idprom.

When supervisor engine 1 (sup1) is in ROMMON and supervisor engine 2 (sup2) is in IOS, only sup2 can read the idprom contents of chassis’ idprom. Chassis type is displayed as “+E” in the output of the show version command. Conversely, sup1 can only display the chassis type as “E.”

When both sup1 and sup2 are in ROMMON, both engines can read the chassis’ idprom. Chassis type is displayed correctly as “+E” in the output of the show version command.

When both sup1 and sup2 are in IOS, both engines can read the chassis’ idprom. Chassis type is displayed correctly as “+E” in the output of the show version command.

## Limitations and Restrictions

These sections list the limitations and restrictions for the current release of Cisco IOS software on the Catalyst 4500E series switch.

* The supervisor engine front-panel management port (FastEthernet1 interface) is not supported.
* The WS-X4712-SFP+E module is not supported in the WS-C4507R-E or WS-C4510R-E chassis and does not boot. This module is supported in the WS-C4503-E, WS-C4506-E, WS-C4507R+E, and WS-C4510R+E chassis.
* 802.1q tunneling and related features are not supported.
* More than 16K QoS policies can be configured in software. Only the first 16K are installed in hardware.
* Adjacency learning (through ARP response frames) is restricted to roughly 1000 new adjacencies per second, depending on CPU utilization. This should only impact large networks on the first bootup. After adjacencies are learned they are installed in hardware.
* Multicast fastdrop entries are not created when RPF failure occurs with IPv6 multicast traffic. In a topology where reverse path check failure occurs with IPv6 multicast, this may cause high CPU utilization on the switch.
* The SNMP ceImageFeature object returns a similar feature list for all the three license levels (LAN Base, IP Base, and EntServices). Although the activated feature set for a universal image varies based on the installed feature license, the value displayed by this object is fixed and is not based on the feature license level.
* Standard TFTP implementation limits the maximum size of a file that can be transferred to 32 MB. If ROMMON is used to boot an IOS image that is larger than 32 MB, the TFTP transfer fails at the 65,xxx datagram.

TFTP numbers its datagrams with a 16 bit field, resulting in a maximum of 65,536 datagrams. Because each TFTP datagram is 512 bytes long, the maximum transferable file is 65536 x 512 = 32 MB. If both the TFTP client (ROMMON) and the TFTP server support block number wraparound, no size limitation exists.

Cisco has modified the TFTP client to support block number wraparound. So, if you encounter a transfer failure, use a TFTP server that supports TFTP block number wraparound. Because most implementations of TFTP support block number wraparound, updating the TFTP daemon should fix the issue.

* A XML-PI specification file entry does not return the desired CLI output.

The outputs of certain commands, such as show ip route and show access-lists, contain non-deterministic text. While the output is easily understood, the output text does not contain strings that are consistently output. A general purpose specification file entry is unable to parse all possible output.

Workaround (1):

While a general purpose specification file entry may not be possible, a specification file entry might be created that returns the desired text by searching for text that is guaranteed to be in the output. If a string is guaranteed to be in the output, it can be used for parsing.

For example, the output of the show ip access-lists SecWiz\_Gi3\_17\_out\_ip command is this:

 Extended IP access list SecWiz\_Gi3\_17\_out\_ip 10 deny ip 76.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 host 65.65.66.67 20 deny ip 76.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 host 44.45.46.47 30 permit ip 76.0.0.0 0.255.255.255 host 55.56.57.57

The first line is easily parsed because access list is guaranteed to be in the output:

 <Property name="access list" alias="Name" distance="1.0" length="-1" type="String" />

The remaining lines all contain the term host. As a result, the specification file may report the desired values by specifying that string. For example, this line

<Property name="host" alias="rule" distance="s.1" length="1" type="String" />

will produce the following for the first and second rules

 <rule> deny </rule>

and the following for the third statement

 <rule> permit <rule>

Workaround (2):

Request the output of the show running-config command using NETCONF and parse that output for the desired strings. This is useful when the desired lines contain nothing in common. For example, the rules in this access list do not contain a common string and the order (three permits, then a deny, then another permit), prevent the spec file entry from using permit as a search string, as in the following example:

 Extended MAC access list MACCOY  permit 0000.0000.ffef ffff.ffff.0000 0000.00af.bcef ffff.ff00.0000 appletalk permit any host 65de.edfe.fefe xns-idp permit any any protocol-family rarp-non-ipv4 deny host 005e.1e5d.9f7d host 3399.e3e1.ff2c dec-spanning permit any any

The XML output of show running-config command includes the following, which can then be parsed programmatically, as desired:

 <mac><access-list><extended><ACLName>MACCOY</ACLName></extended></access-list></mac> <X-Interface> permit 0000.0000.ffef ffff.ffff.0000 0000.00af.bcef ffff.ff00.0000 appletalk</X-Interface> <X-Interface> permit any host 65de.edfe.fefe xns-idp</X-Interface> <X-Interface> permit any any protocol-family rarp-non-ipv4</X-Interface> <X-Interface> deny host 005e.1e5d.9f7d host 3399.e3e1.ff2c dec-spanning</X-Interface> <X-Interface> permit any any</X-Interface>

* When attaching a existing policy-map (that is already applied to a control-port) to another front-panel port, the following message displays:

The policymap <policy-map name> is already attached to control-plane and cannot be shared with other targets.

Workaround: Define a policy-map with a different name and then reattach. CSCti26172

* If the number of unique FNF monitors attached to target exceeds 2048 (one per target), a switch responds slowly:

Workarounds:

 – Decrease the number of monitors.

 – Attach the same monitor to multiple targets. CSCti43798

* ciscoFlashPartitionFileCount object returns an incorrect file count for bootflash:, usb0:, slot0:, slaveslot0:, slavebootflash:, and slaveusb0:.

Workaround: Use the dir device command (for example, dir bootflash:) to obtain the correct file count. CSCti74130

* If multicast is configured and you make changes to the configuration, Traceback and CPUHOG messages are displayed if the following conditions exist:

 – At least 10K groups and roughly 20K mroutes exist.

 – IGMP joins with source traffic transit to all the multicast groups.

This is caused by the large number of updates generating SPI messages that must be processed by the CPU to ensure that the platform is updated with the changes in all the entries.

Workaround: None. CSCti20312

* When attaching a existing policy-map (that is already applied to a control-port) to another front-panel port, following message displays:

The policymap <policy-map name> is already attached to control-plane and cannot be shared with other targets.

Workaround: Define a policy-map with a different name and then reattach. CSCti26172

* With traffic running, entering clear ip mroute \* with larger number of mroutes and over 6 OIFs will cause Malloc Fail messages to display.

You cannot clear a large number of mroutes at one time when traffic is still running.

Workaround: Do not clear all mroutes at once.

CSCtn06753

* Although you can configure subsecond PIM query intervals on Catalyst 4500 platforms, such an action represents a compromise between convergence (reaction time) and a number of other factors (number of mroutes, base line of CPU utilization, CPU speed, processing overhead per 1 m-route, etc.). You must account for those factors when configuring subsecond PIM timers. We recommend that you set the PIM query interval to a minimum of 2 seconds. By adjusting the available parameters, you can achieve flawless operation; that is, a top number of multicast routes per given convergence time on a specific setup.
* With Cisco IOS Release XE 3.2.1SG, memory configuration is enabled:

Switch(config)# memory ? chunk chunk related configuration free free memory low water mark record configure memory event/traceback recording options reserve reserve memory sanity Enable memory sanity

This configuration had been removed erroneously in a prior release.

* A switch crashes after displaying the message:

%AUTHMGR-7-RESULT: Authentication result 'success' from 'dot1x' for client (Unknown MAC) on Interface Gi5/39 AuditSessionID AC156241000000670001BC9.

provided the following conditions apply:

 – A switchport is configured with the following:

authentication event server dead action authorize...

authenticaton event server alive action reinitalize

 – The RADIUS server was down previously, and a port without traffic (for example, a hub with no devices attached) was authorized into the inaccessible authentication bypass (IAB) VLAN without an associated MAC address.

The RADIUS server becomes available again, and the IAB-authorized port transitions to another state.

Workaround: None. CSCtx61557

### Open Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.10SG

This section lists the open caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.9SG:

* The Cisco IOS XE software for the Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series switches includes a version of Bash that is affected by the vulnerabilities identified by the following Common Vulnerability and Exposures (CVE) IDs:

CVE-2014-6271

CVE-2014-6277

CVE-2014-6278

CVE-2014-7169

CVE-2014-7186

CVE-2014-7187

Cisco has analyzed this vulnerability and concluded that while the previously listed products may run a vulnerable version of Bash, there are no exploitation vectors present - therefore, those products are not impacted.

Additional details about those vulnerabilities can be found at
http://cve.mitre.org/cve/cve.html

Workaround: None. CSCur03368

* The show ipv6 access-list command displays incorrect match counts when multicast traffic is matched to an IPv6 access-list attached to an SVI.

This problem affects the Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Supervisor 7E.

Workaround: None. CSCth65129

* When either the RADIUS-server test feature or RADIUS-erver dead-criteria is configured and either RADIUS-server deadtime is not configured or is set to 0, the RADIUS-server status is not properly relayed to AAA.

Workaround: Configure both dead-criteria and deadtime.

radius-server dead-criteriaradius-server deadtime

CSCtl06706

* When spanning tree is changed from PVST to Rapid PVST and you enter the show spanning-tree vlan command, the ports configured as promiscuous trunks are not listed as part of the spanning tree.

Workaround: Enter shut, then no shut on the ports. CSCtn88228

* If you enter the clear ip mroute ? command, only the vrf option is displayed. The Hostname and ' \* ' options are not displayed, although they are accepted by the system, and the clear ip mroute command functions as expected.

Workaround: None. CSCto59368

* On Supervisor Engine 7-E, DBL might not funciton at queue limits less than or equal to 128.

Workaround: Increase the queue limit to at least 256. CSCto57602

* If you use the quick option in the issu changeversion command, the following might occur:

 – Links flap for various Layer 3 protocols.

 – A traffic loss of several seconds occurs during the upgrade process.

Workaround: Do not use the quick option with the issu changeversion command.

CSCto51562

* A device in a Guest VLAN that is connected behind a phone capable of 2nd-port-TLV, experiences packet loss following a SSO failover. The device experiences an authentication restart after the first CDP frame arrives from the phone.

Workaround: None. CSCto46018

* If you perform an OIR on a linecard, several %C4K\_RKNOVA-4-INVALIDTOKENEXPIRED messages appear in the logs.

Workaround: None. CSCtu37959

* On a redundant system consisting of supervisor engines 6-E and 7-E, when the system consumes considerable memory (for example, with heavy multicast traffic), a crash may occur. This event is due to a memory mismatch between the two supervisor engines.

Workaround: Upgrade the memory of Supervisor Engine 6-E to match that of Supervisor Engine 7-E.

* Configuring an interface as uni-directional with the unidirectional send-only | receive-only command still allows the interface to send (configured as “Send-only Unidirection Ethernet mode”) or receive (configured as "Receive-only Unidirection Ethernet mode") packets in a bi-directional mode.

Workaround: None. CSCtx95359

### Resolved Caveats in Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.10SG

* Certain modules X4748 modules for the 4500 switching system unexpectedly drop traffic, considering them giants (*any Ethernet packet that is greater than 1518 bytes is considered a giant*
  ). Affected modules include:

 – WS-X4748-UPOE+E

 – WS-X4748-RJ45V+E

The problem is seen only on modules running Cisco IOS Release IOS-XE 03.02.n.SG.

Certain revisions of the X4748 module display this behavior when running on IOS-XE version 03.02.n.SG. Not all X4748 modules will present this behavior, and it will not show up on newer versions of IOS-XE like 03.04.n.SG or 03.06.n.E.

**Workaround**
: Increasing the MTU on an affected interface to 1518 or higher will allow the traffic through. Upgrading to an IOS-XE version where this issue is not present will resolve the issue. CSCus15382

### Resolved Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.9SG

This section lists the resolved caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.9SG:

* The Cisco IOS Software network address translation (NAT) feature contains multiple denial of service (DoS) vulnerabilities in the translation of the following protocols:

 – NetMeeting Directory (Lightweight Directory Access Protocol, LDAP)

 – Session Initiation Protocol (Multiple vulnerabilities)

 – H.323 protocol

All the vulnerabilities described in this document are caused by packets in transit on the affected devices when those packets require application layer translation. Cisco has released free software updates that address these vulnerabilities.

This advisory is posted at:

* Minor or major temperature alarms are reported in the syslog along with the following DATACORRUPTION logs:

Aug 5 15:54:30.972 Buc: DATACORRUPTION-SP-1-DATAINCONSISTENCY copy error, -PC= 0x414DEED4z-Traceback= 4027C4F4 419551C0 414DEED4 414E5BC4 414E0CA0 414E0F00Aug 5 15:54:30.972 Buc: C6KENV-SP-4-MINORTEMPALARM interface 10/0 outlet temperature crossed threshold #1(=60C). It has exceeded normal operating temperature range.

The symptom is observed on ES+ series linecards of Cisco 7600 Series Routers.

Workaround: None CSCui65914

* When you enter the **wr mem**
  command, the following error message is displayed:

private-config file open failed (File table overflow)

This happens when you continuously reload the standby switch. The client, that is, the active side cannot reach the standby side, and while returning an error, the FD is not released and exhausts FDs. The maximum number of allowed FDs is 128. When this limit is reached, additional files cannot be opened.

Workaround: Reload the switch. CSCug77784

* One or more interfaces on WS-X4748-RJ45V+E stop receiving traffic, making the interface unusable even after entering the **shutdown**
  and **no shutdown**
  interface configuration commands. The **show interface**
  privileged EXEC command indicates that the interface still sends data, but traffic is only unidirectional.

Workarounds:

 – Reseat the line card (or hardware mod reset)

 – Reload the switch.

Both are only temporary workarounds; the failure continues to resurface. CSCui36462

* A PoE device connected to an interface on module WS-X4748-UPOE+E will not power up. The interface will stay down or disconnected. entering the **shutdown**
  and **no shutdown**
  interface configuration commands has no effect.

Any release prior to Cisco IOS Release 3.2.9SG, 3.4.4SG, and 3.6.0E (3.5.0E and 3.5.1E also have the issue.

Workaround: Enter the **test cable-diagnostics tdr**
**interface int**
interface configuration command, to run TDR on the port. CSCui45222

* The Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Switch crashes occasionally when multiple, simultaneous web authentication sessions affect the switch.

Workaround: Avoid custom pages. CSCui71349

* TDR tests results for a port on a WS-X4748-UPOE+E linecard displays Unsupported in the Status field - which is incorrect. Sample output:

Switch # **show cable-diagnostics tdr interface gigabitEthernet 1/1** Interface Speed Local pair Cable length Remote channel StatusGi1/1 0Mbps 1-2 6553 +/-1m Unknown Unsupported  3-6 6553 +/-1m Unknown Unsupported  4-5 6553 +/-1m Unknown Unsupported  7-8 0 m Unknown Unsupported

Workaround: Run TDR twice. CSCuj58332

* MAB does not trigger for devices if they are connected to a port before authentication is configured, provided the port is configured in authentication open mode.

Workaround: Issue clear mac address dynamic to clear the MAC addresses on the switch and cause MAB to trigger when the MAC address is re-learned. CSCul32730

* The FFM process takes up progressively more memory and the free memory depletes by roughly the same amount - if the following conditions exist:

 – A consistent rapid flapping of mroutes.

 – Constant traffic toward a group on a VLAN where the SVI has PIM sparse mode configured, but an RP is not permitted for the group.

Workarounds:

 – For flapping mroutes, track down the flapping mroute and prevent it.

 – For a missing RP scenario, either turn off PIM on the VLAN or allow the multicast group to associate with an RP. CSCul44174

* After upgrading to Cisco IOS Release 3.2.7SG and given more than 1024 active groups, both supervisor engines experience multicast packet loss and the number of S, Gs drops continuously.

Workaround: None. CSCuo18934

* Upon one billion updates after booting, the switch crashes several times with the following log message:

Apr 6 18:58:54.486: %IOSXE-2-PLATFORM: process ng\_dumper: Process ffm: terminated abnormally.

Workaround: Reboot the system at a minimally inconvenient time before 1 billion updates have occurred. CSCuo26294

* When an open-ring REP segment is configured with preemption, it fails to revert to a well-known topology after link state change between a pair of transit neighbors.

Workaround: None. CSCuo51767

* Problem with adding new ports to a channel group. When you configure the **switchport private-vlan mapping trunk <vlan#1> <vlan#2>**
  command on a port and try to add that port to a channel group where the **switchport private-vlan mapping trunk**
  command is not configured, the following error message is displayed:

Apr 23 00:36:33.772 JST: %EC-5-CANNOT\_BUNDLE2: Gi6/1 is not compatible with Gi6/3 and will be suspended (mismatch on Secondary VLAN list on trunk)

Workaround: None. CSCuo89407

* Software returns incorrect permanent license type (MIB value) from day 1. The license MIB value should be 4, but the software returns zero. The enum value cannot be changed because it leads to an ISSU breakage (a new TDL version is introduced).

**Workaround**
: None. The license MIB value for the permanent license type is 4 for all Cisco Catalyst 4000 series products. CSCuo90172

* Removing a VLAN Mapping statement causes all traffic to be consistently dropped for other VLAN mapping statements.

Workarounds:

 – If you want to remove VLAN mapping on 12, but you need mapping on 13 to work, perform these steps:

 a. Enter the **interface gigabitethernet 2/1**
interface configuration command

 b. Enter the **no switchport vlan mapping 12 dot1q-tunnel 200**
interface configuration command

 c. Enter the **no switchport vlan mapping 13 dot1q-tunnel 200**
interface configuration command

 d. Enter the **switchport vlan mapping 13 dot1q-tunnel 200**
interface configuration command

 – If you want to restore the original VLAN mapping statement, perform these steps

 a. Enter the **interface gigabitethernet 2/1**
interface configuration command

 b. Enter the **no switchport vlan mapping 12 dot1q-tunnel 200**
interface configuration command

 c. Enter the **switchport vlan mapping 12 dot1q-tunnel 200**
interface configuration command

 – Enter the **shutdown**
interface configuration command to shut down the port, remove configuration, and then enter the **no shutdown**
interface configuration command. CSCum12826

* When you configure the **ip igmp mroute-proxy**
  interface configuration command and you reload the switch, the switch removes the command. The following example illustrates this problem:

interface Vlan14ip address 10.1.1.1 255.255.255.252ip pim sparse-modeip igmp mroute-proxy Vlan2137end48 Gigabit Ethernet interface2 Ten Gigabit Ethernet interfaces511K bytes of non-volatile configuration memory. ip igmp mroute-proxy Vlan2137 ^% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.

Workaround: Reapply the configuration when the switch reboots. CSCum71764

### Resolved Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.8SG

This section lists the resolved caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.8SG:

* If you configure Open Authentication and perform SSO, the spanning tree state and MAC address are not synchronized to the new standby supervisor engine. The issue interrupts traffic only after the second switchover, because after the initial switchover the new standby supervisor engine possesses the wrong state, and the second switchover will start the port in the blocking state.

Workaround: Enter shut, and then no shut on the port to synchronize the STP state. CSCtf52437

* If REP is configured on a dot1q trunk and the native VLAN is administratively set to a non-default value, REP packets are not sent on the native VLAN.

Workaround: Retain the trunk native V LAN as 1. CSCud05521

* If a dACL name is too long (about 24 characters, depending on the interface where it is applied), the ACL is incorrectly shared over multiple ports.

Workaround: Shorten the dACL name. CSCug78653

* redirect-url and redirect-acl are not cleared after a successful CoA, causing the final step of Central Web Authentication to fail.

Workaround: Return a dACL in the authorization profile with successful guest authentication.

CSCue62019

* If URL redirect is installed as part of authorization and either of the following occurs, memory will leak:

 – A fast stream of traffic matches the URL redirect ACL as IPDT clears an address.

 – A traffic stream matches the URL redirect ACL and no URL redirect policy is installed for that IP address.

If memory leak occurs repeatedly, IPDT and other control packet processing ultimately ceases.

Workaround: If this behavior completely fills the CPU buffer, the switch must be reloaded. However, the frequency of encountering a stuck queue can be reduced to nearly zero by modifying the URL redirect ACL to permit only 80/443 traffic. CSCug56646

* If a device is authenticating while the RADIUS server goes down, the port connected to the device may enter the err-disabled state.

Workaround: Configure RADIUS test and dead criteria.

Example:

radius-server dead-criteria time 10 tries 2radius-server host <ip> test username test key <key>radius-server deadtime 10

CSCtn92693

* An SNMP walk of the LLDP MIB (OID 1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.5.4795) times out and produces a message similar to the following:

Jun 19 10:48:51.835 UTC: %SYS-3-CPUHOG: Task is running for (2016)msecs, more than (2000)msecs (5/5),process = SNMP ENGINE.

Workaround: Exclude the mib "lldpXMedMIB" with the snmp-server view restrict lldpXMedMIB excluded command. CSCuh88726

### Open Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.7SG

This section lists the open caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.7SG:

* When collecting data from the cpmCPUProcessHistoryTable, the data takes a long time to provide and the CPU utilization of the os\_info\_p process (OS Info provider) increases substantially. The time it takes to do a full walk of an almost fully populated table takes 68 minutes.

Workaround: None. CSCth42248

* The show ipv6 access-list command displays incorrect match counts when multicast traffic is matched to an IPv6 access-list attached to an SVI.

This problem affects the Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Supervisor 7E.

Workaround: None. CSCth65129

* When either the RADIUS-server test feature or RADIUS-erver dead-criteria is configured and either RADIUS-server deadtime is not configured or is set to 0, the RADIUS-server status is not properly relayed to AAA.

Workaround: Configure both dead-criteria and deadtime.

radius-server dead-criteriaradius-server deadtime

CSCtl06706

* When spanning tree is changed from PVST to Rapid PVST and you enter the show spanning-tree vlan command, the ports configured as promiscuous trunks are not listed as part of the spanning tree.

Workaround: Enter shut, then no shut on the ports. CSCtn88228

* Unless you enter the show mem detailed process command on a Supervisor Engine 7-E switch, the parser chain is not displayed.

Workaround: Enter the complete command string:

show mem detailed process cli\_agent

CSCtj05663

* If you configure Open Authentication and perform SSO, the spanning tree state and MAC address are not synchronized to the new standby supervisor engine. The issue interrupts traffic only after the second switchover, because after the initial switchover the new standby supervisor engine possesses the wrong state, and the second switchover will start the port in the blocking state.

Workaround: Enter shut, and then no shut on the port to synchronize the STP state. CSCtf52437

* If you reboot a switch, the configured value of interface MTU size on the members of port-channel interface does not function for IPv6 traffic.

Workaround: After the switch reloads, enter shut, then no shut on the port-channel interface.

CSCto27085

* If you enter the clear ip mroute ? command, only the vrf option is displayed. The Hostname and ' \* ' options are not displayed, although they are accepted by the system, and the clear ip mroute command functions as expected.

Workaround: None. CSCto59368

* On Supervisor Engine 7-E, DBL might not funciton at queue limits less than or equal to 128.

Workaround: Increase the queue limit to at least 256. CSCto57602

* If you use the quick option in the issu changeversion command, the following might occur:

 – Links flap for various Layer 3 protocols.

 – A traffic loss of several seconds occurs during the upgrade process.

Workaround: Do not use the quick option with the issu changeversion command.

CSCto51562

* A device in a Guest VLAN that is connected behind a phone capable of 2nd-port-TLV, experiences packet loss following a SSO failover. The device experiences an authentication restart after the first CDP frame arrives from the phone.

Workaround: None. CSCto46018

* Dynamic ACLs do not function correctly if they include advanced operators, including dscp/ipp/tos, log/log-input, fragments and/or tcp flag operators.

Workaround: Remove these operators from any dynamic ACLs. CSCts05302

* If you perform an OIR on a linecard, several %C4K\_RKNOVA-4-INVALIDTOKENEXPIRED messages appear in the logs.

Workaround: None. CSCtu37959

* On a redundant system consisting of supervisor engines 6-E and 7-E, when the system consumes considerable memory (for example, with heavy multicast traffic), a crash may occur. This event is due to a memory mismatch between the two supervisor engines.

Workaround: Upgrade the memory of Supervisor Engine 6-E to match that of Supervisor Engine 7-E.

* Configuring an interface as uni-directional with the unidirectional send-only | receive-only command still allows the interface to send (configured as “Send-only Unidirection Ethernet mode”) or receive (configured as "Receive-only Unidirection Ethernet mode") packets in a bi-directional mode.

Workaround: None. CSCtx95359

* If REP is configured on a dot1q trunk and the native VLAN is administratively set to a non-default value, REP packets are not sent on the native VLAN.

Workaround: Retain the trunk native V LAN as 1. CSCud05521

* If a dACL name is too long (about 24 characters, depending on the interface where it is applied), the ACL is incorrectly shared over multiple ports.

Workaround: Shorten the dACL name. CSCug78653

* redirect-url and redirect-acl are not cleared after a successful CoA, causing the final step of Central Web Authentication to fail.

Workaround: Return a dACL in the authorization profile with successful guest authentication.

CSCue62019

* If URL redirect is installed as part of authorization and either of the following occurs, memory will leak:

 – A fast stream of traffic matches the URL redirect ACL as IPDT clears an address.

 – A traffic stream matches the URL redirect ACL and no URL redirect policy is installed for that IP address.

If memory leak occurs repeatedly, IPDT and other control packet processing ultimately ceases.

Workaround: If this behavior completely fills the CPU buffer, the switch must be reloaded. However, the frequency of encountering a stuck queue can be reduced to nearly zero by modifying the URL redirect ACL to permit only 80/443 traffic. CSCug56646

* If a device is authenticating while the RADIUS server goes down, the port connected to the device may enter the err-disabled state.

Workaround: Configure RADIUS test and dead criteria.

Example:

radius-server dead-criteria time 10 tries 2radius-server host <ip> test username test key <key>radius-server deadtime 10

CSCtn92693

* An SNMP walk of the LLDP MIB (OID 1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.5.4795) times out and produces a message similar to the following:

Jun 19 10:48:51.835 UTC: %SYS-3-CPUHOG: Task is running for (2016)msecs, more than (2000)msecs (5/5),process = SNMP ENGINE.

Workaround: Exclude the mib "lldpXMedMIB" with the snmp-server view restrict lldpXMedMIB excluded command. CSCuh88726

### Resolved Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.7SG

This section lists the resolved caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.7SG:

* SFP modules GLC-SX-MMD and GLC-SH-LMD may not be recognized when used with the WS-X4448-GB-SFP linecard.

Workarounds:

 – Use modules GLC-SX-MM and GLC-LH-SM instead.

 – Use a release other than IOS XE 3.2.0SG (or IOS 15.0(2)SG) through IOS XE 3.2.6SG (or IOS 15.0(2)SG6). CSCub52430

* On a Supervisor Engine 7-E running IOS Release XE 3.2.6SG and using PIM, a packet memory leak occurs when an "S,G entry" is created. When sufficient packets are leaked, IGMP packets are no longer processed and the switch must reload to restore service.

Workaround: None. This issue does not occur in any other release, or in IOS Release XE 3.2.6SG when PIM is disabled. CSCue03401

### Open Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.6SG

This section lists the open caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.6SG:

* When collecting data from the cpmCPUProcessHistoryTable, the data takes a long time to provide and the CPU utilization of the os\_info\_p process (OS Info provider) increases substantially. The time it takes to do a full walk of an almost fully populated table takes 68 minutes.

Workaround: None. CSCth42248

* The show ipv6 access-list command displays incorrect match counts when multicast traffic is matched to an IPv6 access-list attached to an SVI.

This problem affects the Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Supervisor 7E.

Workaround: None. CSCth65129

* When either the RADIUS-server test feature or RADIUS-erver dead-criteria is configured and either RADIUS-server deadtime is not configured or is set to 0, the RADIUS-server status is not properly relayed to AAA.

Workaround: Configure both dead-criteria and deadtime.

radius-server dead-criteriaradius-server deadtime

CSCtl06706

* When spanning tree is changed from PVST to Rapid PVST and you enter the show spanning-tree vlan command, the ports configured as promiscuous trunks are not listed as part of the spanning tree.

Workaround: Enter shut, then no shut on the ports. CSCtn88228

* Unless you enter the show mem detailed process command on a Supervisor Engine 7-E switch, the parser chain is not displayed.

Workaround: Enter the complete command string:

show mem detailed process cli\_agent

CSCtj05663

* If you configure Open Authentication and perform SSO, the spanning tree state and MAC address are not synchronized to the new standby supervisor engine. The issue interrupts traffic only after the second switchover, because after the initial switchover the new standby supervisor engine possesses the wrong state, and the second switchover will start the port in the blocking state.

Workaround: Enter shut, and then no shut on the port to synchronize the STP state. CSCtf52437

* If you reboot a switch, the configured value of interface MTU size on the members of port-channel interface does not function for IPv6 traffic.

Workaround: After the switch reloads, enter shut, then no shut on the port-channel interface.

CSCto27085

* If you enter the clear ip mroute ? command, only the vrf option is displayed. The Hostname and ' \* ' options are not displayed, although they are accepted by the system, and the clear ip mroute command functions as expected.

Workaround: None. CSCto59368

* On Supervisor Engine 7-E, DBL might not funciton at queue limits less than or equal to 128.

Workaround: Increase the queue limit to at least 256. CSCto57602

* If you use the quick option in the issu changeversion command, the following might occur:

 – Links flap for various Layer 3 protocols.

 – A traffic loss of several seconds occurs during the upgrade process.

Workaround: Do not use the quick option with the issu changeversion command.

CSCto51562

* A device in a Guest VLAN that is connected behind a phone capable of 2nd-port-TLV, experiences packet loss following a SSO failover. The device experiences an authentication restart after the first CDP frame arrives from the phone.

Workaround: None. CSCto46018

* Dynamic ACLs do not function correctly if they include advanced operators, including dscp/ipp/tos, log/log-input, fragments and/or tcp flag operators.

Workaround: Remove these operators from any dynamic ACLs. CSCts05302

* If you perform an OIR on a linecard, several %C4K\_RKNOVA-4-INVALIDTOKENEXPIRED messages appear in the logs.

Workaround: None. CSCtu37959

* On a redundant system consisting of supervisor engines 6-E and 7-E, when the system consumes considerable memory (for example, with heavy multicast traffic), a crash may occur. This event is due to a memory mismatch between the two supervisor engines.

Workaround: Upgrade the memory of Supervisor Engine 6-E to match that of Supervisor Engine 7-E.

* Configuring an interface as uni-directional with the unidirectional send-only | receive-only command still allows the interface to send (configured as “Send-only Unidirection Ethernet mode”) or receive (configured as "Receive-only Unidirection Ethernet mode") packets in a bi-directional mode.

Workaround: None. CSCtx95359

* On a Supervisor Engine 7-E running IOS Release XE 3.2.6SG and using PIM, a packet memory leak occurs when an "S,G entry" is created. When sufficient packets are leaked, IGMP packets are no longer processed and the switch must reload to restore service.

Workaround: None. This issue does not occur in any other release, or in IOS Release XE 3.2.6SG when PIM is disabled. CSCue03401

* If REP is configured on a dot1q trunk and the native VLAN is administratively set to a non-default value, REP packets are not sent on the native VLAN.

Workaround: Retain the trunk native V LAN as 1. CSCud05521

* SFP modules GLC-SX-MMD and GLC-SH-LMD may not be recognized when used with the WS-X4448-GB-SFP linecard.

Workarounds:

 – Use modules GLC-SX-MM and GLC-LH-SM instead.

 – Use a release other than IOS XE 3.2.0SG (or IOS 15.0(2)SG) through IOS XE 3.2.6SG (or IOS 15.0(2)SG6). CSCub52430

* If a dACL name is too long (about 24 characters, depending on the interface where it is applied), the ACL is incorrectly shared over multiple ports.

Workaround: Shorten the dACL name. CSCug78653

* redirect-url and redirect-acl are not cleared after a successful CoA, causing the final step of Central Web Authentication to fail.

Workaround: Return a dACL in the authorization profile with successful guest authentication.

CSCue62019

* If URL redirect is installed as part of authorization and either of the following occurs, memory will leak:

 – A fast stream of traffic matches the URL redirect ACL as IPDT clears an address.

 – A traffic stream matches the URL redirect ACL and no URL redirect policy is installed for that IP address.

If memory leak occurs repeatedly, IPDT and other control packet processing ultimately ceases.

Workaround: If this behavior completely fills the CPU buffer, the switch must be reloaded. However, the frequency of encountering a stuck queue can be reduced to nearly zero by modifying the URL redirect ACL to permit only 80/443 traffic. CSCug56646

* If a device is authenticating while the RADIUS server goes down, the port connected to the device may enter the err-disabled state.

Workaround: Configure RADIUS test and dead criteria.

Example:

radius-server dead-criteria time 10 tries 2radius-server host <ip> test username test key <key>radius-server deadtime 10

CSCtn92693

* An SNMP walk of the LLDP MIB (OID 1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.5.4795) times out and produces a message similar to the following:

Jun 19 10:48:51.835 UTC: %SYS-3-CPUHOG: Task is running for (2016)msecs, more than (2000)msecs (5/5),process = SNMP ENGINE.

Workaround: Exclude the mib "lldpXMedMIB" with the snmp-server view restrict lldpXMedMIB excluded command. CSCuh88726

### Resolved Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.6SG

This section lists the resolved caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.6SG:

* A %SYS-2-NOBLOCK or %SYS-2-BLOCKHUNG message may appear on the switch when an interface with a QoS policy changes speed at the same time information about that interface is being collected (most commonly through a CLI like the show policy-map ... command). Although the QoS policy programming might fail for that interface, no operational impact is observed.

Workaround: None. CSCtk52874

* In a square Layer 2 topology (of at least four switches) where the root bridge is outside of the square (a fifth switch), one link in the square that transitions its role from alternate to root will not send topology change notifications. A stale MAC address may exist in the table until age-out.

Workaround: Reduce MAC aging time or modify Layer 2 topology so that the root is within the square. CSCtx86107

* A switch crashes after displaying the message

%AUTHMGR-7-RESULT: Authentication result 'success' from 'dot1x' for client (Unknown MAC) on Interface Gi5/39 AuditSessionID AC156241000000670001BC9

provided the following conditions apply:

 – A switchport is configured with the following:

authentication event server dead action authorize

authenticaton event server alive action reinitalize

 – The RADIUS server was down previously, and a port without traffic (for example, a hub with no devices attached) was authorized into the inaccessible authentication bypass (IAB) VLAN without an associated MAC address.

The RADIUS server becomes available again, and the IAB-authorized port transitions to another state.

Workaround: None. CSCtx61557

* The default SNMP engine ID is the same on Supervisor Engine 7-E switches running releases prior to IOS XE 3.2.6SG.

Workaround: Configure an SNMP engine ID. CSCts87275

* IPSec frames less than 74 bytes are “dropped” on 4748 linecards and Supervisor Engine 7-E uplink ports. (IPsec is supported for management traffic only)

Workaround: None. CSCub00709

### Open Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.5SG

* On a redundant system consisting of supervisor engines 6-E and 7-E, when the system consumes considerable memory (for example, with heavy multicast traffic), a crash may occur. This event is due to a memory mismatch between the two supervisor engines.

Workaround: Upgrade the memory of Supervisor Engine 6-E to match that of Supervisor Engine 7-E.

* If you use Supervisor Engine 7E or Supervisor Engine 7L-E and you enter either the show redundancy or commands beginning with the keyword redundancy, the following error displays:

Failed to find pr\_handlers by uri

.Workaround: None. A reload is required to restore these commands. CSCtw95861

* When you execute the show flow monitor monitor\_name params top number command simultaneously from different terminals to display the top flows, the supervisor engine might crash.

Workaround: Avoid entering fleible netflow show commands from more than one terminal, when you want to display the top flows. CSCtw61872

* After a switch reestablishes a lost connection with AAA servers configured for broadcast accounting, the switch crashes.

Workaround: Do not use the broadcast keyword in the aaa accounting configuration. CSCts56125

* A switch configured with 802.1X might shows considerable CPU usage by the 802.1X switch process and displays the following message:

SYS-2-MALLOCFAIL messages, and - on redundant systems - begins logging EM-4-SENDFAILED messages,

The occurs under the following conditions:

 – Multi-auth (or multi-host) and MAB dot1x are configured on a port.

 – A voice VLAN is not configured on the port.

 – The device authenticates through 802.1X.

 – The connected device sends no traffic, falls over to MAB, and then successfully authenticates through 802.1X.

 – A dynamic VLAN is assigned to the port following 802.1X authorization.

Workarounds:

 – Enter shut then no shut on the port to halt the high CPU and log messages.

 – Enter the switchport voice vlan command on the port. CSCtw73754

* If PoE linecards are present and you enter either the show power inline module x or show power inline module x detail command, very rarely the supervisor engine might crash.

Workaround: None. CSCtx25697

* After a few hours of operation, during which DHCP is enabled and sessions receive DHCP information from a RADIUS server, a Cisco ASR router running as an LNS box crashes with DHCP related errors.

Workaround: None. CSCtj48387

* On a Supervisor Engine 7 running Cisco XE Release 3.2.2SG or 3.2.3SG, SNMP polling of CISCO-PROCESS-MIB data may cause high CPU and SNMP polling timeouts.

Workaround: Use the sample below to restrict SNMP polling from retrieving 1.3.6.1.4.1.9.9.109:

* Configuring an interface as uni-directional with the unidirectional send-only | receive-only command still allows the interface to send (configured as “Send-only Unidirection Ethernet mode”) or receive (configured as "Receive-only Unidirection Ethernet mode") packets in a bi-directional mode.

Workaround: None. CSCtx95359

* If a switch is configured with the aaa accounting send stop-record authentication failure command, and MAB fails on the port and subsequent attempts are made to authorize the device after the restart timer expires, a high level of memory usage due to the "MAB Framework" process is observed.

Workaround: Unconfigure the following from the switch: aaa accounting send stop-record authentication failure. CSCtj69212

* If REP is configured on a dot1q trunk and the native VLAN is administratively set to a non-default value, REP packets are not sent on the native VLAN.

Workaround: Retain the trunk native V LAN as 1. CSCud05521

* SFP modules GLC-SX-MMD and GLC-SH-LMD may not be recognized when used with the WS-X4448-GB-SFP linecard.

Workarounds:

 – Use modules GLC-SX-MM and GLC-LH-SM instead.

 – Use a release other than IOS XE 3.2.0SG (or IOS 15.0(2)SG) through IOS XE 3.2.6SG (or IOS 15.0(2)SG6). CSCub52430

 –

* If a dACL name is too long (about 24 characters, depending on the interface where it is applied), the ACL is incorrectly shared over multiple ports.

Workaround: Shorten the dACL name. CSCug78653

* redirect-url and redirect-acl are not cleared after a successful CoA, causing the final step of Central Web Authentication to fail.

Workaround: Return a dACL in the authorization profile with successful guest authentication.

CSCue62019

* If URL redirect is installed as part of authorization and either of the following occurs, memory will leak:

 – A fast stream of traffic matches the URL redirect ACL as IPDT clears an address.

 – A traffic stream matches the URL redirect ACL and no URL redirect policy is installed for that IP address.

If memory leak occurs repeatedly, IPDT and other control packet processing ultimately ceases.

Workaround: If this behavior completely fills the CPU buffer, the switch must be reloaded. However, the frequency of encountering a stuck queue can be reduced to nearly zero by modifying the URL redirect ACL to permit only 80/443 traffic. CSCug56646

* If a device is authenticating while the RADIUS server goes down, the port connected to the device may enter the err-disabled state.

Workaround: Configure RADIUS test and dead criteria.

Example:

radius-server dead-criteria time 10 tries 2radius-server host <ip> test username test key <key>radius-server deadtime 10

CSCtn92693

* An SNMP walk of the LLDP MIB (OID 1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.5.4795) times out and produces a message similar to the following:

Jun 19 10:48:51.835 UTC: %SYS-3-CPUHOG: Task is running for (2016)msecs, more than (2000)msecs (5/5),process = SNMP ENGINE.

Workaround: Exclude the mib "lldpXMedMIB" with the snmp-server view restrict lldpXMedMIB excluded command. CSCuh88726

### Resolved Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.3SG

This section lists the resolved caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.3SG:

* If a Supervisor Engine 7E is running Cisco IOS Release 3.2.2SG and a considerable quantity of simultaneous ACL, QoS, or Layer 3 programming occurs (usually on switch bootup), ACL, QoS and Layer 3 changes fail to take effect from that point forward.

Workaround: None. The supervisor engine must be reloaded or failed over. CSCtw93728

### Open Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.2SG

This section lists the open caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.3SG:

* When collecting data from the cpmCPUProcessHistoryTable, the data takes a long time to provide and the CPU utilization of the os\_info\_p process (OS Info provider) increases substantially. The time it takes to do a full walk of an almost fully populated table takes 68 minutes.

Workaround: None. CSCth42248

* The show ipv6 access-list command displays incorrect match counts when multicast traffic is matched to an IPv6 access-list attached to an SVI.

This problem affects the Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Supervisor 7E.

Workaround: None. CSCth65129

* When either the RADIUS-server test feature or RADIUS-erver dead-criteria is configured and either RADIUS-server deadtime is not configured or is set to 0, the RADIUS-server status is not properly relayed to AAA.

Workaround: Configure both dead-criteria and deadtime.

CSCtl06706

* When spanning tree is changed from PVST to Rapid PVST and you enter the show spanning-tree vlan command, the ports configured as promiscuous trunks are not listed as part of the spanning tree.

Workaround: Enter shut, then no shut on the ports. CSCtn88228

* Unless you enter the show mem detailed process command on a Supervisor Engine 7-E switch, the parser chain is not displayed.

Workaround: Enter the complete command string:

show mem detailed process cli\_agent

CSCtj05663

* If you configure Open Authentication and perform SSO, the spanning tree state and MAC address are not synchronized to the new standby supervisor engine. The issue interrupts traffic only after the second switchover, because after the initial switchover the new standby supervisor engine possesses the wrong state, and the second switchover will start the port in the blocking state.

Workaround: Enter shut, and then no shut on the port to synchronize the STP state. CSCtf52437

* If you reboot a switch, the configured value of interface MTU size on the members of port-channel interface does not function for IPv6 traffic.

Workaround: After the switch reloads, enter shut, then no shut on the port-channel interface.

CSCto27085

* If you enter the clear ip mroute ? command, only the vrf option is displayed. The Hostname and ' \* ' options are not displayed, although they are accepted by the system, and the clear ip mroute command functions as expected.

Workaround: None. CSCto59368

* On Supervisor Engine 7-E, DBL might not funciton at queue limits less than or equal to 128.

Workaround: Increase the queue limit to at least 256. CSCto57602

* If you use the quick option in the issu changeversion command, the following might occur:

 – Links flap for various Layer 3 protocols.

 – A traffic loss of several seconds occurs during the upgrade process.

Workaround: Do not use the quick option with the issu changeversion command.

CSCto51562

* A device in a Guest VLAN that is connected behind a phone capable of 2nd-port-TLV, experiences packet loss following a SSO failover. The device experiences an authentication restart after the first CDP frame arrives from the phone.

Workaround: None. CSCto46018

* Dynamic ACLs do not function correctly if they include advanced operators, including dscp/ipp/tos, log/log-input, fragments and/or tcp flag operators.

Workaround: Remove these operators from any dynamic ACLs. CSCts05302

* If you perform an OIR on a linecard, several %C4K\_RKNOVA-4-INVALIDTOKENEXPIRED messages appear in the logs.

### Resolved Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.2SG

This section lists the resolved caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.2SG:

* If Flex link load balancing is configured on a PVLAN flex link pair and some VLANs prefer the backup interface in the pair, entering shut and then no shut on the backup flex link interface causes high cpu from SA miss events. This happens because dynamic mac address learning is broken.

The primary flex link interface comes up correctly.

Workaround: Configure static MAC address for the MAC address that must be learned dynamically on the backup flex link interface. CSCtr40070

* After booting a switch with Supervisor Engine 7-E, you observe two versions of incorrect up time when using show version or show redundancy:

Scenario #1: Display 136 years, 10 weeks, 6 hours, 26 minutes

Workaround: None. CSCtr52740

* Configuring and copying a TCL policy may cause a Catalyst 4500 series switch to hang.

Workaround: None. CSCto72927

* Layer 2 multicast is not switched egress with a port-channel interface after a member link or port-channel flaps.

Workaround:

1. Delete, then add the affected VLAN with no vlan vlan\_ID, then lan vlan\_ID.

2. Flap the impacted port-channel with shutdown then no shutdown. CSCtr17251

* When a switch is configured for MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) EAP and the AAA server requests EAP-TLS (as the EAP method) first, MAB fails.

Workarounds:

 – Configure the switch port for mab rather than mab eap.

 – Configure the AAA server to propose EAP-MD5 first rather than EAP-TLS for MAB EAP requests. CSCti78674

* One or more line cards (WS-X46xx and WS-X47xx series) stop responding to interface changes when near-simultaneous link events (if timed correctly) occur on the same linecard.

Only line cards in the WS-X46xx series and the WS-X47xx series are affected. Interfaces that are already linked-up are not affected.

Workaround: Eliminate link flap. If the problem exists, do one of the following:

 – Reload the linecard module with the hw-module module n reset command.

 – For dual supervisor engines, perform a switchover. CSCts67025

* Frequent link flap can trigger a failure that causes control plane latency until the switch is reloaded. After the issue is triggered, normal traffic is forwarded without drops, but pings to or from the switch drop, and new connections to linecards come up slowly or not at all. The following error messages appear:

C4K\_WATCHDOG-3-CHILDFAILURE: C4K\_LINECARD-3-INTERRUPTDELAYED: C4K\_LINECARD-3-INTERRUPTCOMPLETED:

Workaround: Eliminate link flap.

Provide temporary remediation with a forced supervisor engine switchover. CSCtt06131

* Occasionally, when an interface with a QoS policy changes speed or when a QoS policy is being programmed on an interface, a Supervisor Engine 7 might unexpectedly encounter an FFM crash.

Workaround: None. CSCtn81726

* Rarely, an FFM crash may occur when control plane queues are slow to empty.

Workaround: None. CSCtr07852

* A vulnerability in the Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) implementation of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a reload of an affected device. Repeated attempts to exploit this vulnerability could result in a sustained denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available. This advisory is available at the following link:

CSCtr28857

* Rarely, an FFM crash may occur when control plane queues are slow to empty.

Workaround: None. CSCtr07852

* If a Supervisor Engine 7E is running Cisco IOS Release 3.2.2SG and a considerable quantity of simultaneous ACL, QoS, or Layer 3 programming occurs (usually on switch bootup), ACL, QoS and Layer 3 changes fail to take effect from that point forward.

Workaround: None. The supervisor engine must be reloaded or failed over. CSCtw93728

* On a redundant system consisting of supervisor engines 6-E and 7-E, when the system consumes considerable memory (for example, with heavy multicast traffic), a crash may occur. This event is due to a memory mismatch between the two supervisor engines.

Workaround: Upgrade the memory of Supervisor Engine 6-E to match that of Supervisor Engine 7-E.

* If you use Supervisor Engine 7E or Supervisor Engine 7L-E and you enter either the show redundancy or commands beginning with the keyword redundancy, the following error displays:

Failed to find pr\_handlers by uri

.Workaround: None. A reload is required to restore these commands. CSCtw95861

* When you execute the show flow monitor monitor\_name params top number command simultaneously from different terminals to display the top flows, the supervisor engine might crash.

Workaround: Avoid entering flexible netflow show commands from more than one terminal, when you want to display the top flows. CSCtw61872

* After a switch reestablishes a lost connection with AAA servers configured for broadcast accounting, the switch crashes.

Workaround: Do not use the broadcast keyword in the aaa accounting configuration. CSCts56125

* A switch configured with 802.1X might shows considerable CPU usage by the 802.1X switch process and displays the following message:

SYS-2-MALLOCFAIL messages, and - on redundant systems - begins logging EM-4-SENDFAILED messages,

The occurs under the following conditions:

 – Multi-auth (or multi-host) and MAB dot1x are configured on a port.

 – A voice VLAN is not configured on the port.

 – The device authenticates through 802.1X.

 – The connected device sends no traffic, falls over to MAB, and then successfully authenticates through 802.1X.

 – A dynamic VLAN is assigned to the port following 802.1X authorization.

Workarounds:

 – Enter shut then no shut on the port to halt the high CPU and log messages.

 – Enter the switchport voice vlan command on the port. CSCtw73754

* If PoE linecards are present and you enter either the show power inline module x or show power inline module x detail command, very rarely the supervisor engine might crash.

Workaround: None. CSCtx25697

* After a few hours of operation, during which DHCP is enabled and sessions receive DHCP information from a RADIUS server, a Cisco ASR router running as an LNS box crashes with DHCP related errors.

Workaround: None. CSCtj48387

* Configuring an interface as uni-directional with the unidirectional send-only | receive-only command still allows the interface to send (configured as “Send-only Unidirection Ethernet mode”) or receive (configured as "Receive-only Unidirection Ethernet mode") packets in a bi-directional mode.

Workaround: None. CSCtx95359

* If a switch is configured with the aaa accounting send stop-record authentication failure command, and MAB fails on the port and subsequent attempts are made to authorize the device after the restart timer expires, a high level of memory usage due to the "MAB Framework" process is observed.

Workaround: Unconfigure the following from the switch: aaa accounting send stop-record authentication failure. CSCtj69212

* If REP is configured on a dot1q trunk and the native VLAN is administratively set to a non-default value, REP packets are not sent on the native VLAN.

Workaround: Retain the trunk native V LAN as 1. CSCud05521

* SFP modules GLC-SX-MMD and GLC-SH-LMD may not be recognized when used with the WS-X4448-GB-SFP linecard.

Workarounds:

 – Use modules GLC-SX-MM and GLC-LH-SM instead.

 – Use a release other than IOS XE 3.2.0SG (or IOS 15.0(2)SG) through IOS XE 3.2.6SG (or IOS 15.0(2)SG6). CSCub52430

* If a dACL name is too long (about 24 characters, depending on the interface where it is applied), the ACL is incorrectly shared over multiple ports.

Workaround: Shorten the dACL name. CSCug78653

* redirect-url and redirect-acl are not cleared after a successful CoA, causing the final step of Central Web Authentication to fail.

Workaround: Return a dACL in the authorization profile with successful guest authentication.

CSCue62019

* If URL redirect is installed as part of authorization and either of the following occurs, memory will leak:

 – A fast stream of traffic matches the URL redirect ACL as IPDT clears an address.

 – A traffic stream matches the URL redirect ACL and no URL redirect policy is installed for that IP address.

If memory leak occurs repeatedly, IPDT and other control packet processing ultimately ceases.

Workaround: If this behavior completely fills the CPU buffer, the switch must be reloaded. However, the frequency of encountering a stuck queue can be reduced to nearly zero by modifying the URL redirect ACL to permit only 80/443 traffic. CSCug56646

* If a device is authenticating while the RADIUS server goes down, the port connected to the device may enter the err-disabled state.

Workaround: Configure RADIUS test and dead criteria.

Example:

radius-server dead-criteria time 10 tries 2radius-server host <ip> test username test key <key>radius-server deadtime 10

CSCtn92693

* An SNMP walk of the LLDP MIB (OID 1.0.8802.1.1.2.1.5.4795) times out and produces a message similar to the following:

Jun 19 10:48:51.835 UTC: %SYS-3-CPUHOG: Task is running for (2016)msecs, more than (2000)msecs (5/5),process = SNMP ENGINE.

Workaround: Exclude the mib "lldpXMedMIB" with the snmp-server view restrict lldpXMedMIB excluded command. CSCuh88726

### Resolved Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.1SG

This section lists the resolved caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.1SG:

* When you configure EnergyWise power control on PoE ports with a time-based execution schedule, time entry executes without adjusting for daylight savings time.

Workaround: Manually re-enter all entries with new time settings.

CSCsy27389

* Under Cisco IOS Release 15.0.1.XO, Control Plane Policing is missing class system-cgmp-cpp. When adding this class manually and then attaching a policer to this class, the policer matches on any IP packet.

Workaround: Do not use or remove class system-cgmp-cpp. CSCtn46868

* After a session falls back to Web Authentication, and no port ACL or fallback ACL is configured, Auth\_Default\_ACL is programmed infrequently.

Workaround: Configure a port ACL on the interface. CSCtl89389

* When re-connecting to a switch using device tracking, a Windows Vista, 2008, or 2007 device registers a duplicate address message. A Windows Vista, 2008, or 2007 client probes for a tentative IP address while the switch probes for device status. This issue is usually triggered by disconnecting or reconnecting.

Workaround: Disable gratuitous ARPs on the Windows device. CSCtn27420

* If you create a new IPv6 ACL, delete a permit ACE, and then add back the permit ACE, the sh run | b ipv6 access-list command displays unexpected commands on the IPv6 access-list configuration.

sh run | b ipv6 access-listipv6 access-list ipv6acl permit icmp any FF01::/16 permit icmp any FF02::/16 sequence 40 permit icmp any FE80::/10sequence 40 (appears in front of entry)

In the output above, sequence 40 is the unexpected command that appears in front of the entry.

Workaround: Delete the access-list and reconfigure all entries, rather than deleting or reconfiguring the access-list. CSCtn83348

* A switch configured for epm open directive in multi-auth configuration fails when authentication sessions are cleared.

Workaround: Do not configure open directive on the switch.

CSCto48824

* A switch fails when you change the maximum login attempts value for a webauthentication session.

Workaround: Modify max login attempts when webauth is not active. CSCtn17953

* During an SSO/ISSU operation, if an EEE linecard is OIR'd, removed or replaced, and the Ethernet Energy Efficient feature is configured on a given port, the configuration cannot be saved.

Workaround: Deconfigure EEE before running SSO/ISSU or relocating an EE linecard; or reconfigure EEE again after the upgrade or linecard reinsertion.

CSCto97743

* The power reported as delivered to a UPOE (greater than 30 watts) client may drop suddenly when a supervisor engine switchover occurs. The device still functions properly, provided power inline police is not enabled on the device's port.

Workaround: Do not enable power inline police on ports delivering more than 30 watts in a redundant system. CSCtq32785

* A Supervisor Engine 7-E might fail when the output queuing policy is removed and readded through some range of interfaces that undergoes speed change or negotiation and the impacted interface has an attached queuing policy.

Workaround: None. CSCtq57827

* On a Supervisor Engine 7-E, if an output service policy is applied on a port and that port is connected to a PC or other client device, some traffic appears to be dropped in the egress direction after boot up because of misprogrammed port TxQ.

Workaround:Remove and readd the outbound service policy. CSCtq40350

* If you use IGMP reports with groups like 226.0.0.2, 225.0.0.2, or 225.128.0.2, HSRP hello packets drop and HSRP peers are down. This happens because HSRP hello packets are sent to MAC address 224.0.0.2, which overlaps with the IGMP group addresses just mentioed.

Workaround: None. Use a different IGMP group address. CSCtq15982

* The list of VLANs defined by the vlan-range command used for configuring per-VLAN QoS is too long, causing the system to reject the command and display the following log:

Command rejected: Bad VLAN list - character #"X" (EOL) delimits a VLAN number ("Y") end of range not larger than the start of range ("Z").

Workaround: None CSCtr49819

* Switches using ESM logging filter TCL script will fail after some time.

Workaround: Remove the logging filter. CSCto76709

* A Supervisor Engine 7-E will fail when the following applies when an ACL used by the class-map is modified to match new traffic and a control plane policy is currently attache.

Workaround: Configure new class-maps and a policy-map. Replace the control plane policy with the new policy. CSCto45530

* A host IP is not inserted into a URL redirect ACL unless the host IP is already in the device tracking table (DHCP snooping or IPDT).

Workaround: None. CSCtn63638

* A host IP is not inserted into a URL redirect ACL unless the host IP is already in the device tracking table (DHCP snooping or IPDT).

Workaround: None. CSCtn63638

* DACLs, filter-ID, and proxy ACLs do not function correctly.

Workaround: None. CSCto79232

* DACLs, filter-ID, and proxy ACLs do not function correctly.

Workaround: None. CSCto79232

### Open Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.0SG

This section lists the open caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.0SG:

* When you configure EnergyWise power control on PoE ports with a time-based execution schedule, time entry executes without adjusting for daylight savings time.

Workaround: Manually re-enter all entries with new time settings.

CSCsy27389

* When collecting data from the cpmCPUProcessHistoryTable, the data takes a long time to provide and the CPU utilization of the os\_info\_p process (OS Info provider) increases substantially. The time it takes to do a full walk of an almost fully populated table takes 68 minutes.

Workaround: None. CSCth42248

* The show ipv6 access-list command displays incorrect match counts when multicast traffic is matched to an IPv6 access-list attached to an SVI.

This problem affects the Cisco Catalyst 4500 Series Supervisor 7E.

Workaround: None. CSCth65129

* Under Cisco IOS Release 15.0.1.XO, Control Plane Policing is missing class system-cgmp-cpp. When adding this class manually and then attaching a policer to this class, the policer matches on any IP packet.

Workaround: Do not use or remove class system-cgmp-cpp. CSCtn46868

* Supervisor Engine 7-E running Cisco IOS XE 3.1.1(SG) crashes with FFM traceback when applying a qos policy to all the interfaces of a WS-X4748-RJ45V+E module with the interface range command.

Workaround: None. CSCtn81726

* When either the RADIUS-server test feature or RADIUS-erver dead-criteria is configured and either RADIUS-server deadtime is not configured or is set to 0, the RADIUS-server status is not properly relayed to AAA.

Workaround: Configure both dead-criteria and deadtime.

radius-server dead-criteriaradius-server deadtime

CSCtl06706

* After a session falls back to Web Authentication, and no port ACL or fallback ACL is configured, Auth\_Default\_ACL is programmed infrequently.

Workaround: Configure a port ACL on the interface. CSCtl89389

* When spanning tree is changed from PVST to Rapid PVST and you enter the show spanning-tree vlan command, the ports configured as promiscuous trunks are not listed as part of the spanning tree.

Workaround: Enter shut, then no shut on the ports. CSCtn88228

* Unless you enter the show mem detailed process command on a Supervisor Engine 7-E switch, the parser chain is not displayed.

Workaround: Enter the complete command string:

show mem detailed process cli\_agent

CSCtj05663

* When re-connecting to a switch using device tracking, a Windows Vista, 2008, or 2007 device registers a duplicate address message. A Windows Vista, 2008, or 2007 client probes for a tentative IP address while the switch probes for device status. This issue is usually triggered by disconnecting or reconnecting.

Workaround: Disable gratuitous ARPs on the Windows device. CSCtn27420

* If you create a new IPv6 ACL, delete a permit ACE, and then add back the permit ACE, the sh run | b ipv6 access-list command displays unexpected commands on the IPv6 access-list configuration.

sh run | b ipv6 access-listipv6 access-list ipv6acl permit icmp any FF01::/16 permit icmp any FF02::/16 sequence 40 permit icmp any FE80::/10sequence 40 (appears in front of entry)

In the output above, sequence 40 is the unexpected command that appears in front of the entry.

Workaround: Delete the access-list and reconfigure all entries, rather than deleting or reconfiguring the access-list. CSCtn83348

* If you configure Open Authentication and perform SSO, the spanning tree state and MAC address are not synchronized to the new standby supervisor engine. The issue interrupts traffic only after the second switchover, because after the initial switchover the new standby supervisor engine possesses the wrong state, and the second switchover will start the port in the blocking state.

Workaround: Enter shut, and then no shut on the port to synchronize the STP state. CSCtf52437

* If you reboot a switch, the configured value of interface MTU size on the members of port-channel interface does not function for IPv6 traffic.

Workaround: After the switch reloads, enter shut, then no shut on the port-channel interface.

CSCto27085

* A switch configured for epm open directive in multi-auth configuration fails when authentication sessions are cleared.

Workaround: Do not configure open directive on the switch.

CSCto48824

* If you enter the clear ip mroute ? command, only the vrf option is displayed. The Hostname and ' \* ' options are not displayed, although they are accepted by the system, and the clear ip mroute command functions as expected.

Workaround: None. CSCto59368

* On Supervisor Engine 7-E, DBL might not funciton at queue limits less than or equal to 128.

Workaround: Increase the queue limit to at least 256. CSCto57602

* If you use the quick option in the issu changeversion command, the following might occur:

 – Links flap for various Layer 3 protocols.

 – A traffic loss of several seconds occurs during the upgrade process.

Workaround: Do not use the quick option with the issu changeversion command.

CSCto51562

* A switch fails when you change the maximum login attempts value for a webauthentication session.

Workaround: Modify max login attempts when webauth is not active. CSCtn17953

* A device in a Guest VLAN that is connected behind a phone capable of 2nd-port-TLV, experiences packet loss following a SSO failover. The device experiences an authentication restart after the first CDP frame arrives from the phone.

Workaround: None. CSCto46018

* A host IP is not inserted into a URL redirect ACL unless the host IP is already in the device tracking table (DHCP snooping or IPDT).

Workaround: None. CSCtn63638

* DACLs, filter-ID, and proxy ACLs do not function correctly.

Workaround: None. CSCto79232

* If Filter ID or fallback ACLs are currently applied to a port, and you modify them, they will not be programmed correctly in hardware.

Workaround: Modify filter ID or fallback ACLs only when they are not in use. CSCto79274

* During an SSO/ISSU operation, if an EEE linecard is OIR'd, removed or replaced, and the Ethernet Energy Efficient feature is configured on a given port, the configuration cannot be saved.

Workaround: Deconfigure EEE before running SSO/ISSU or relocating an EE linecard; or reconfigure EEE again after the upgrade or linecard reinsertion.

CSCto97743

* The power reported as delivered to a UPOE (greater than 30 watts) client may drop suddenly when a supervisor engine switchover occurs. The device still functions properly, provided power inline police is not enabled on the device's port.

Workaround: Do not enable power inline police on ports delivering more than 30 watts in a redundant system. CSCtq32785

* If you perform an OIR on a linecard, several %C4K\_RKNOVA-4-INVALIDTOKENEXPIRED messages appear in the logs.

Workaround: None. CSCtu37959

* When configuring, removing, and reapplying IP SLA configuration (reapply without the history filter) and querying the rttmonhistory tree, a Catalyst4 948-10GE switch will fail.

Workaround: None. CSCtr52740

* Layer 2 multicast is not switched egress with a port-channel interface after a member link or port-channel flaps.

Workaround:

1. Delete, then add the affected VLAN with no vlan vlan\_ID, then lan vlan\_ID.

2. Flap the impacted port-channel with shutdown, then no shutdown. CSCtr17251

* Configuring and copying a TCL policy may cause a Catalyst 4500 series switch to hang.

Workaround: None. CSCto72927

* If Flex link load balancing is configured on a PVLAN flex link pair and some VLANs prefer the backup interface in the pair, entering shut and then no shut on the backup flex link interface causes high cpu from SA miss events. This happens because dynamic mac address learning is broken.

The primary flex link interface comes up correctly.

Workaround: Configure static MAC address for the MAC address that must be learned dynamically on the backup flex link interface. CSCtr40070

* When a switch is configured for MAC Authentication Bypass (MAB) EAP and the AAA server requests EAP-TLS (as the EAP method) first, MAB fails.

Workarounds:

 – Configure the switch port for mab rather than mab eap.

 – Configure the AAA server to propose EAP-MD5 first rather than EAP-TLS for MAB EAP requests. CSCti78674

* One or more line cards (WS-X46xx and WS-X47xx series) stop responding to interface changes when near-simultaneous link events (if timed correctly) occur on the same linecard.

Only line cards in the WS-X46xx series and the WS-X47xx series are affected. Interfaces that are already linked-up are not affected.

Workaround: Eliminate link flap. If the problem exists, do one of the following:

 – Reload the linecard module with the hw-module module n reset command.

 – For dual supervisor engines, perform a switchover. CSCts67025

* Frequent link flap can trigger a failure that causes control plane latency until the switch is reloaded. After the issue is triggered, normal traffic is forwarded without drops, but pings to or from the switch drop, and new connections to linecards come up slowly or not at all. The following error messages appear:

C4K\_WATCHDOG-3-CHILDFAILURE: C4K\_LINECARD-3-INTERRUPTDELAYED: C4K\_LINECARD-3-INTERRUPTCOMPLETED:

Workaround: Eliminate link flap.

Provide temporary remediation with a forced supervisor engine switchover. CSCtt06131

* After booting a switch with Supervisor Engine 7-E, you observe two versions of incorrect up time when using show version or show redundancy:

Scenario #1: Display 136 years, 10 weeks, 6 hours, 26 minutes

Workaround: None. CSCtr54218

* Occasionally, when an interface with a QoS policy changes speed or when a QoS policy is being programmed on an interface, a Supervisor Engine 7 might unexpectedly encounter an FFM crash.

Workaround: None. CSCtn81726

* A vulnerability in the Multicast Source Discovery Protocol (MSDP) implementation of Cisco IOS Software and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow a remote, unauthenticated attacker to cause a reload of an affected device. Repeated attempts to exploit this vulnerability could result in a sustained denial of service (DoS) condition.

Cisco has released free software updates that address this vulnerability. Workarounds that mitigate this vulnerability are available. This advisory is available at the following link:

Workaround: Exclude the mib "lldpXMedMIB" with the snmp-server view restrict lldpXMedMIB excluded command. CSCuh88726

### Resolved Caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.0SG

This section lists the resolved caveats for Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.0SG:

* On a redundant configuration, if a switchover occurs immediately after a port falls back to Webauth from 802.1X or MAB, you may notice a delay in loading the Webauth login page on the browser.

Workaround: Enter shut, then no-shut on the link, then flush the IP device tracking table.

CSCtc99174

* The ip igmp snooping command is not visible in VLAN range mode.

Workaround: IGMP snooping can still be disabled on VLANs individually. CSCth17903

* When you attempt to copy from slaveusb0: or to slaveusb0:, the following message displays:

Copy in progress...CCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCCC%Error reading slaveusb0:realtest (Error Sending Request)

Workaround: Avoid remote copying to or from a standby usb0:. Copy from a standby bootflash or make a local copy directly at the standby bootflash. CSCti29518

* On all redundant configurations, RF Switchover History time is incorrect when accessed through cRFHistorySwactTime.

Workaround: Use the show redundancy and show redundancy states commands to retrieve the switchover history times. CSCti53834

* On all redundant configurations, SNMP operations to obtain Redundancy Switchover history using cRFHistoryTable fail, displaying the following message:

“NO\_SUCH\_INSTANCE\_EXCEPTION.”

Workaround: Enter the show redundancy switchover history command to obtain redundancy switchover history. CSCti55424

* The ciscoFlashPartitionFileCount object returns an incorrect file count for bootflash:, usb0:, slot0:, slaveslot0:, slavebootflash:, and slaveusb0:.

Workaround: Use the dir device command to obtain the correct file count (for example, dir bootflash:). CSCti74130

* When you try to copy to slaveusb0: from the active bootflash, the following message displays:

%Error writing slaveusb0:/cat4500e-universalk9-lite.SSA.0.DEV-0.0.DEV-0.bin (Error Sending Request) \*Jul 30 11:38:58.890 UTC: %IOSXE-3-PLATFORM: STANDBY:4 kernel: usb 1-2: device descriptor read/64, error -110\*Jul 30 11:39:14.169 UTC: %IOSXE-3-PLATFORM: STANDBY:4 kernel: usb 1-2: device descriptor read/64, error -110  \*Jul 30 11:39:29.625 UTC: %IOSXE-3-PLATFORM: STANDBY:4 kernel: usb 1-2: device descriptor read/64, error -110

Workaround: Remove the slaveusb0, reinsert the slaveusb0:, then recopy. CSCti19321

* Three to five minutes after you create a GRE tunnel between interfaces on two switches (first hop and last hop), you observe that the FHR begins to drop the tunnel traffic. This causes the (S,G) entry, originally created on the LHR when sending IPv6 source traffic, to time out.

Workaround: Enter shut, then no shut on the host port interface of the first hop. CSCti44397

* If you are using a large customized Web Authentication login page on a switch running Cisco IOS Release 12.2(53)SG3 or IOS XE 3.1.0 SG and multiple users attempt to access custom HTML pages, the switch might reload.

Workaround: Unconfigure the customized HTML page to use default internal Webauth pages, change the configuration, then reload the switch. CSCti81874

* The Policy Based Routing (PBR) function fails on a Supervisor Engine 7-E running Cisco IOS Release 3.2.1.SG. Packets are software switched and not sent to the next hop as defined in the PBR route-map. Packets are routed to their destination via the IP routing table lookup rather than the route-map configured on the ingress interface.

The show platform hardware acl in entries vlan command indicates that the ACL action does not point to an adjacency for the affected VLAN(s).

Workaround: Enter the cef table output-chain build favor memory-utilization command globally. CSCtn91576

* When kron initiates a write to the startup-config (that is, execution of the write mem command), it is locked indefinitely.

switch# show runUnable to get configuration. Try again later.

Workaround: Reload the switch to restore access, then use EEM with the timer event to schedule the required task. CSCtk68692

* If a redirect ACL is installed on multiple ports using cisco-av-pair url-redirect-acl=ACLNAME and you modify the ACL, the EPM MAIN process reports elevated CPU usage.

Workaround: None. CSCtn61307

* If host mode multi-domain is configured, after a successful authorization, neither the data device nor the IP phone will pass traffic.

Workaround: None. CSCtj56811

* A non-supplicant PC is connected to an 802.1x port in MDA mode. Upon no response to EAPOL, the PC is placed in a Guest VLAN (correct behavior). If the supplicant is enabled on the PC and the credentials are entered, the switch reports AUTHC success and AUTHZ fail. If client re-attempts 802.1x before the port returns to the Guest VLAN, this process succeeds.

Workaround: None. CSCtl89361

* When a configuration file has VTP mode off and is copied to the running config, the VLANs that are not already in the VLAN database are not created.

Workarounds:

 – Use VTP Mode transparent.

 – Create the VLANs manually. CSCtl94096

* LACP ports between a Catalyst 4500 Switch and a Nexus enter Suspended Mode when the native VLAN is tagged and changed to x on both chassis (native VLAN is not 1).

Workaround: None. CSCtj90471

* LLDP frames are tagged incorrectly when leaving an 802.1q port if the native VLAN has a value other than 1.

Workaround: Use the default native VLAN (VLAN of 1) for the trunks. CSCtn29321

* Some non-powered devices fail to linkup when connected to a 4648-RJ45-E/+E or 4748-RJ45+E line card port with a two-pair/4-wire cable (1,2,3,6).

This behavior is observed when you use IBM Cable Systems Type 1A/2A or any two-pair cable, including Cat5e.

Workaround:

 – Use a four-pair wire.

 – Enter the power inline never command.

 – Enter the speed auto 10 100 command. CSCtn43537

* Following a route flap, a Supervisor Engine 7-E running Cisco IOS XE Release 3.1.0XO or 3.1.1SG crashes and generates an FFM crashinfo file.

Workaround: None. Upgrade to Cisco IOS XE Release 3.2.0SG or higher. CSCtr54723

## Troubleshooting

These sections provide troubleshooting guidelines for the Catalyst 4500 series switches running IOS supervisor engines:

* [Netbooting from ROMMON](/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#57202)
* [Troubleshooting at the System Level](/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#10159)
* [Troubleshooting Modules](/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#16067)
* [Troubleshooting MIBs](/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#66836)

### Netbooting from ROMMON

Netbooting using a boot loader image is not supported. Instead, use one of the following options to boot an image:

 1. Boot from an SD card by entering the following command:

rommon 1> **boot slot0:**<bootable\_image>

 2. Use ROMMON TFTP boot.

The ROMMON TFTP boot is very similar to the BOOTLDR TFTP boot, except that:

 – the BOOTLDR variable should not be set

 – the TFTP server must be accessible from the Ethernet management port on the supervisor engine.

To boot from ROMMON, perform the following tasks while in ROMMON mode:

 a. Ensure that the Ethernet management port on the supervisor engine is physically connected to the network.

 b. Verify that bootloader environment is not set by entering the **unset bootldr**
command.

 c. Set IP address of the Ethernet management port on the supervisor engine by entering the following command: set interface fa1 *ip\_address*
*ip\_mask*

For example, to set the supervisor engine Ethernet port with an IP address 172.16.1.5 and IP mask 255.255.255.0, enter the following command:

rommon 2> **set interface fa1 172.16.1.5 255.255.255.0**

 d. Set default gateway for the Ethernet management port on the supervisor engine by entering the following command: **set ip route default**
*gateway\_ip\_address*
. The default gateway should be directly connected to the supervisor engine Ethernet management port subnet.

 e. Ping the TFTP server to ensure that there is connectivity to the server from the Ethernet management port on the supervisor engine by entering the following command: **ping**
*tftp\_server\_ip\_address*
.

 f. Once the ping is successful, boot the image from the TFTP server by entering the following command: **boot tftp://**
*tftp\_server\_ip\_address*
**/**
*image\_path\_and\_file\_name*

For example, to boot the Cisco IOS XE image cat4500e-universalk9.03.01.00 .SG.150-1.XO.bin located on the TFTP server 172.16.1.8, enter the following command:

rommon 3> **boot tftp://172.16.1.8/tftpboot/cat4500e-universalk9.03.01.00 .SG.150-1.XO.bin**
### Troubleshooting at the System Level

This section contains troubleshooting guidelines for system-level problems:

* When the system is booting and running power-on diagnostics, do not reset the switch.
* Ensure that you do not mix the serial and Ethernet cables plugged into the supervisor engine. The Fast Ethernet port (10/100 MGT) on the supervisor engine is inoperative. An Ethernet cable plugged into the Fast Ethernet port is active only in ROMMON mode.

### Troubleshooting Modules

This section contains troubleshooting guidelines for modules:

* When you hot insert a module into a chassis, always use the ejector levers on the front of the module to seat the backplane pins properly. Inserting a module without using the ejector levers might cause the supervisor engine to display incorrect messages about the module. For module installation instructions, refer to the Catalyst 4500 *Series Module Installation Guide*
  .
* Whenever you connect an interface that has duplex set to autonegotiate to an end station or another networking device, ensure that the other device is configured for autonegotiation as well. If the other device is not set to autonegotiate, the port set to autonegotiate will remain in half-duplex mode, which can cause a duplex mismatch resulting in packet loss, late collisions, and line errors on the link.

### Troubleshooting MIBs

For general information on MIBs, RMON groups, and traps, refer to the Cisco public MIB directory (
<http://www.cisco.com/public/sw-center/netmgmt/cmtk/mibs.shtml>
). For information on the specific MIBs supported by the Catalyst 4500 series switches, refer to the Catalyst 4000 MIB Support List located at ftp://ftp.cisco.com/pub/mibs/supportlists/cat4000/cat4000-supportlist.html.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS and IOS XE Software Common Industrial Protocol Privilege Escalation Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-XE-SAP-OPLbze68  First Published: 2021 March 24 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvu58224](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu58224)     CVE-2021-1392     CWE-522       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2021-1392     CWE-522       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-XE-SAP-OPLbze68/csaf/cisco-sa-XE-SAP-OPLbze68.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the CLI command permissions of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to retrieve the password for Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) and then remotely configure the device as an administrative user.  This vulnerability exists because incorrect permissions are associated with the **show cip security** CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing the command to retrieve the password for CIP on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reconfigure the device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-XE-SAP-OPLbze68>  This advisory is part of the March 2021 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2021 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74408).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software and have CIP enabled.  CIP is not enabled by default.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether CIP Is Enabled To determine whether CIP is enabled on a device, issue the **show cip status** command and check the **State: *value*.** The following example shows that CIP is enabled for VLAN 1:  ```   Router> show cip statusState : EnabledVlan : 1   ```  If the command returns no output or returns an error message, as shown in the following example, the device is not affected by this vulnerability:  ```   Router> show cip status             ^% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS XR Software   + NX-OS Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, mitigations are available:    + Disabling the CIP feature eliminates the attack vector for this vulnerability and may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. To disable the CIP feature, use the **no cip enable** command in the interface configuration mode for the VLAN that CIP is currently enabled on.   + For devices that are configured with TACACS+ authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) command authorization, use this feature to give non-administrative users access to the commands that they require and deny access to all other commands. While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**:     By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.  For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.

| | Cisco Security AdvisoryCisco IOS and IOS XE Software Common Industrial Protocol Privilege Escalation Vulnerability High   Advisory ID:  cisco-sa-XE-SAP-OPLbze68  First Published: 2021 March 24 16:00 GMT  Version 1.0:  [Final](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#final)   Workarounds:  No workarounds available  Cisco Bug IDs: [CSCvu58224](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCvu58224)     CVE-2021-1392     CWE-522       CVSS Score: [Base 7.8](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvssCalculator.x?version=3.1&vector=CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)**Click Icon to Copy Verbose Score** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X       CVE-2021-1392     CWE-522       [Download CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-XE-SAP-OPLbze68/csaf/cisco-sa-XE-SAP-OPLbze68.json)   Email      Summary  * A vulnerability in the CLI command permissions of Cisco IOS and Cisco IOS XE Software could allow an authenticated, local attacker to retrieve the password for Common Industrial Protocol (CIP) and then remotely configure the device as an administrative user.  This vulnerability exists because incorrect permissions are associated with the **show cip security** CLI command. An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by issuing the command to retrieve the password for CIP on an affected device. A successful exploit could allow the attacker to reconfigure the device.  Cisco has released software updates that address this vulnerability. There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-XE-SAP-OPLbze68>  This advisory is part of the March 2021 release of the Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication. For a complete list of the advisories and links to them, see [Cisco Event Response: March 2021 Semiannual Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software Security Advisory Bundled Publication](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/viewErp.x?alertId=ERP-74408).  Affected Products  * Vulnerable Products This vulnerability affects Cisco devices if they are running a vulnerable release of Cisco IOS or Cisco IOS XE Software and have CIP enabled.  CIP is not enabled by default.  For information about which Cisco software releases are vulnerable, see the [Fixed Software](#fs) section of this advisory. Determine Whether CIP Is Enabled To determine whether CIP is enabled on a device, issue the **show cip status** command and check the **State: *value*.** The following example shows that CIP is enabled for VLAN 1:  ```   Router> show cip statusState : EnabledVlan : 1   ```  If the command returns no output or returns an error message, as shown in the following example, the device is not affected by this vulnerability:  ```   Router> show cip status             ^% Invalid input detected at '^' marker.   ```    Products Confirmed Not Vulnerable Only products listed in the [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section of this advisory are known to be affected by this vulnerability.  Cisco has confirmed that this vulnerability does not affect the following Cisco products:    + IOS XR Software   + NX-OS Software  Workarounds  * There are no workarounds that address this vulnerability. However, mitigations are available:    + Disabling the CIP feature eliminates the attack vector for this vulnerability and may be a suitable mitigation until affected devices can be upgraded. To disable the CIP feature, use the **no cip enable** command in the interface configuration mode for the VLAN that CIP is currently enabled on.   + For devices that are configured with TACACS+ authentication, authorization, and accounting (AAA) command authorization, use this feature to give non-administrative users access to the commands that they require and deny access to all other commands. While these mitigations have been deployed and were proven successful in a test environment, customers should determine the applicability and effectiveness in their own environment and under their own use conditions. Customers should be aware that any workaround or mitigation that is implemented may negatively impact the functionality or performance of their network based on intrinsic customer deployment scenarios and limitations. Customers should not deploy any workarounds or mitigations before first evaluating the applicability to their own environment and any impact to such environment.  Fixed Software  * Cisco has released free software updates that address the vulnerability described in this advisory. Customers may only install and expect support for software versions and feature sets for which they have purchased a license. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software upgrades, customers agree to follow the terms of the Cisco software license:<https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/end-user-license-agreement.html>  Additionally, customers may only download software for which they have a valid license, procured from Cisco directly, or through a Cisco authorized reseller or partner. In most cases this will be a maintenance upgrade to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.  When [considering software upgrades](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes), customers are advised to regularly consult the advisories for Cisco products, which are available from the [Cisco Security Advisories page](https://www.cisco.com/go/psirt), to determine exposure and a complete upgrade solution.  In all cases, customers should ensure that the devices to be upgraded contain sufficient memory and confirm that current hardware and software configurations will continue to be supported properly by the new release. If the information is not clear, customers are advised to contact the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) or their contracted maintenance providers. Customers Without Service Contracts Customers who purchase directly from Cisco but do not hold a Cisco service contract and customers who make purchases through third-party vendors but are unsuccessful in obtaining fixed software through their point of sale should obtain upgrades by contacting the Cisco TAC: <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html>  Customers should have the product serial number available and be prepared to provide the URL of this advisory as evidence of entitlement to a free upgrade. Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software To help customers determine their exposure to vulnerabilities in Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco provides the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to identify any Cisco Security Advisories that impact a specific software release and the earliest release that fixes the vulnerabilities described in each advisory (“First Fixed”). If applicable, the tool also returns the earliest release that fixes all the vulnerabilities described in all the advisories identified (“Combined First Fixed”).  Customers can use the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) to search advisories in the following ways:    + Choose the software and one or more releases   + Upload a .txt file that includes a list of specific releases   + Enter the output of the **show version** command After initiating a search, customers can customize the search to include all Cisco Security Advisories, a specific advisory, or all advisories in the most recent bundled publication.  Customers can also use the following form to determine whether a release is affected by any Cisco Security Advisory by entering a Cisco IOS or IOS XE Software release-for example, **15.1(4)M2** or **3.13.8S**:     By default, the [Cisco Software Checker](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/softwarechecker.x) includes results only for vulnerabilities that have a Critical or High Security Impact Rating (SIR). To include results for Medium SIR vulnerabilities, customers can use the Cisco Software Checker on Cisco.com and check the **Medium** check box in the drop-down list under **Impact Rating** when customizing a search.  For a mapping of Cisco IOS XE Software releases to Cisco IOS Software releases, refer to the [Cisco IOS XE 2 Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21/rnasr21_gen.html#wp3000032), [Cisco IOS XE 3S Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/ios/ios_xe/3/release/notes/asr1k_rn_3s_rel_notes/asr1k_rn_3s_sys_req.html#wp3069754), or [Cisco IOS XE 3SG Release Notes](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/td/docs/switches/lan/catalyst4500/release/note/OL_24726.html#pgfId-2570252), depending on the Cisco IOS XE Software release.

## Software Packaging on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers

The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers run Cisco IOS XE 3S Software and use a software packaging model consisting of:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Consolidated packages

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Individual software subpackages within a consolidated package

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Optional software subpackages outside of consolidated packages

Each Cisco IOS XE 3S consolidated package contains a collection of individual software subpackages. Each individual software subpackage is an individual software file that controls a different element or elements of the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router. Some individual subpackages may be installed per element (for example, per SPA).

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The subpackage functionality is intended for both upgrade and field support, and not all combinations of subpackages are supported.

---

Each individual software subpackage can be upgraded individually, or all individual software subpackages for a specific Cisco IOS XE 3S consolidated package can be upgraded as part of a complete Cisco IOS XE 3S consolidated package upgrade.

Importantly, IOS (the RPIOS individual software subpackage) is considered one of the individual software subpackages that makes up the complete Cisco IOS XE 3S consolidated package.

The following are the individual software subpackages within a consolidated package:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Route Processor

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)RPBase: Provides the Route-Processor operating system.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)RPControl: Provides the control-plane processes that interface between Cisco IOS Software and the rest of the platform.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)RPIOS: Provides the Cisco IOS Software kernel, which is where Cisco IOS Software features are stored and run; each consolidated image variant has a different RPIOS subpackage: RPIOS-ipbase, RPIOS-ipbasek9, RPIOS-advipservices, RPIOS-advipservicesk9, RPIOS-adventservices, and RPIOS-adventservicesk9.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The RPIOS-advipservices and RPIOS-adventservices subpackages are only available beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1 and later releases. These two subpackages are not available with Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.2 and earlier releases.

---

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)RPAccess: Provides components to manage enhanced router access functionality.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ESP

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ESPBase: Provides the ESP operating system and control processes, and the Cisco QuantumFlow Processor client, driver, and ucode.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)SIP

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)SIPBase: Provides the SIP operating system and control processes

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)SIPSPA: Provides the SPA drivers and associated field-programmable device (FPD) image (SPA FPGA image)

A Cisco IOS XE 3S consolidated package allows users to upgrade all individual software subpackages on the router with a single Cisco IOS XE 3S image download. The Cisco IOS XE 3S consolidated packages available vary based on the Route Processor (RP1 or RP2) installed in the system and the Cisco IOS XE 3S Release.

The following are the RP1 consolidated packages:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 IP BASE W/O CRYPTO

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 IP BASE

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 ADVANCED IP SERVICES

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 ADVANCED IP SERVICES W/O CRYPTO

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 ADVANCED ENTERPRISE SERVICES

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 ADVANCED ENTERPRISE SERVICES W/O CRYPTO

The following are the RP2 consolidated packages:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP2 ADVANCED ENTERPRISE SERVICES W/O CRYPTO

The individual software subpackages within the consolidated packages cannot be downloaded from Cisco.com; only the Cisco IOS XE S consolidated packages and optional subpackages can be downloaded from Cisco.com. Users who want to run the router using individual software subpackages must first download the consolidated package from Cisco.com and extract the individual software subpackages from the consolidated package.

In addition to the individual software subpackages within a consolidated package, optional software subpackages that are not part of a consolidated package are available. Optional software subpackages are downloaded separately from Cisco.com and their installation is similar to the installation of an individual software subpackage using a provisioning file. The optional subpackage must be located in the same directory with the provisioning file and the other individual subpackage files. The optional software subpackages available vary based on the Route Processor (RP) installed in the system: RP1 or RP2:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For the RP1, the optional software subpackage available is the Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 WebEx Node (asr1000rp1-sipspawmak9.version.pkg)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For the RP2, the optional software subpackage available is the Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP2 WebEx Node (asr1000rp2-sipspawmak9.version.pkg)

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 WebEx Node and Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP2 WebEx Node optional software subpackages are only available beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.0 and later releases and are only supported in conjunction with a related RP-based Cisco ASR 1000 Series RPx IP BASE, Cisco ASR 1000 Series RPx ADVANCED IP SERVICES, or Cisco ASR 1000 Series RPx ADVANCED ENTERPRISE SERVICES consolidated package. These optional software subpackages are not supported with earlier Cisco IOS XE releases or with any of the non-CRYPTO consolidated packages.

## Cisco IOS XE 3S Software Package Compatibility for ISSU

Cisco IOS XE Release 3.1S is an ISSU break release. In Cisco IOS XE Release 3.1S, ISSU upgrade and subpackage software upgrade from Cisco IOS XE Release 2.x to Cisco IOS XE Release 3.xS, including Release 3.1S, is not supported. The ISSU downgrade from Cisco IOS XE Release 3.xS, including Release 3.1S to 2.x, is not supported either.

ISSU upgrade and subpackage software upgrade are restarted from Cisco IOS XE Release 3.1S. Therefore, rebuilds and releases after Cisco IOS XE Release 3.1S will support ISSU and software upgrade and downgrade, based on the ISSU compatibility matrix tables. For example, ISSU upgrade and downgrade between Cisco IOS XE Release 3.1.0S (15.0(1)S) to Cisco IOS XE Release 3.xS are supported.

For information about Cisco IOS XE 3.x releases that supports ISSU and software upgrade and downgrade, based on the ISSU compatibility matrix tables in Cisco IOS XE Release 3 releases, see the "[Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Software Package Compatibility for ISSU"](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_sys_req.html#wp2999236) section in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release Notes.

For information about Cisco IOS XE 2.x releases that supports ISSU and software upgrade and downgrade, based on the ISSU compatibility matrix tables in Cisco IOS XE Release 2 releases, see the ["Cisco IOS XE Release Compatibility Tables"](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21.html#wp2491503) section in Release Notes for Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco IOS XE software compatibility is between "like" images, for example, advipservicesk9 to advipservicesk9, adventerprisek9 to adventerprisek9, and so on. Cross-image-type upgrades or installations are not supported in the ISSU process. For example, you cannot upgrade ipbase to advipservicesk9 or advipservices to advipservicesk9.

### Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers

The Cisco IOS XE 3S images and packages available vary based on the route processor (either RP1 or RP2) installed in the system:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Table 2](#wp3066852) describes the RP1 consolidated package images, their individual software subpackage contents, and their memory recommendations.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Table 3](#wp3067471) describes the RP1 optional subpackage images and their memory recommendations.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Table 5](#wp3068180) describes the RP2 optional subpackage images and their memory recommendations.

Each Cisco IOS XE 3S image also contains two provisioning files: asr1000rpx-packages.image.version.conf and packages.conf. A provisioning file is used for booting only in cases where the individual modules are extracted from the Cisco IOS XE 3.1S image and then used to run the router. Either provisioning file can be used.

For information about recommended and minimum ROMmon version requirements see the ["ROMmon Release Requirements"](http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/release/notes/asr1k_rn_sys_req.html#wp3001284) section in Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers Release Notes.

## Determining the Software Version

This section provides information about determining the software version.

### Determining the Consolidated Package Version

To determine the version of the Cisco IOS XE Software (consolidated package) running on your Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router, log in to the router and enter the show version EXEC command.

The following is sample output of the show version command. The actual output displayed when you run the command will vary depending on the version of the product that you are using.

```
Router# show version

```

```

```

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

## Introduction

The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers are the next generation Cisco midrange router products. The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Routers use an innovative and powerful hardware processor technology known as the Cisco QuantumFlow Processor. The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers consist of three different routers: the Cisco ASR 1002 Router, the Cisco ASR 1004 Router, and the Cisco ASR 1006 Router.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1002 Router is a 3-SPA, 2-rack-unit (RU) chassis with one Embedded Services Processor (ESP) slot that comes with the Route Processor (RP), Cisco ASR 1000 Series Shared Port Adapter Interface Processor (SIP), and four Gigabit Ethernet ports built in.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1004 Router is an 8-SPA, 4-RU chassis with one ESP slot, one RP slot, and two SIP slots.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1006 Router is a 12-SPA, 6-rack-unit (RU), hardware-redundant chassis with two Embedded Services Processor (ESP) slots, two Route Processor (RP) slots, and three SIP slots.

For the single-route-processor Cisco ASR 1000 platforms, the Cisco ASR 1002 and Cisco ASR 1004, the Route Processor has a dual Cisco IOS Software option that allows these routers to use Cisco IOS software redundancy, Cisco high-availability features, Nonstop Forwarding (NSF), and In Service Software Upgrades (ISSUs). This option requires the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Route Processor to have 4 GB of DRAM memory.

The Cisco ASR 1006 Router supports fully redundant Route Processors that allow for full Route-Processor hardware redundancy, NSF, ISSU, and future Route-Processor service upgrades.

The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers run Cisco IOS XE Software and introduce a distributed software architecture that moves many operating system responsibilities out of the IOS process. In this architecture, Cisco IOS, which previously was responsible for almost all of the internal software processes, now runs as one of many Cisco IOS XE processes while allowing other Cisco IOS XE processes to share responsibility for running the router.

One of the key features of the Cisco IOS XE Software is support for dual Cisco IOS software consolidated packages in a single Route Processor for software redundancy in the 2-RU and 4-RU chassis systems. These dual Cisco IOS consolidated packages can consist of the same software consolidated packages for backup or different software consolidated packages for resilient upgrade.

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Software redundancy is not supported on the 6-RU chassis.

---

The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers target both enterprise and service provider applications and provide application-specific features for broadband subscriber aggregation and network application services with improved processing performance and high availability.

For information on new features and Cisco IOS commands supported by Cisco IOS XE Release 2, see the ["New and Changed Information" section](#wp3000153) and the ["Related Documentation" section](#wp3006081).

### Software Packaging on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers

The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers run Cisco IOS XE Software and use a new software packaging model consisting of:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Consolidated packages

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Individual software sub-packages within a consolidated package

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Optional software sub-packages outside of consolidated packages

Each Cisco IOS XE consolidated package contains a collection of individual software sub-packages. Each individual software sub-package is an individual software file that controls a different element or elements of the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router. Some individual sub-packages may be installed per element (for example, per SPA).

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The sub-package functionality is intended for both upgrade and field support, and not all combinations of sub-packages are supported.

---

Each individual software sub-package can be upgraded individually, or all individual software sub-packages for a specific Cisco IOS XE consolidated package can be upgraded as part of a complete Cisco IOS XE consolidated package upgrade.

Importantly, IOS (the RPIOS individual software sub-package) is considered one of the individual software sub-packages that makes up the complete Cisco IOS XE consolidated package.

The following are the individual software sub-packages within a consolidated package:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Route Processor

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)RPBase: Provides the Route-Processor operating system.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)RPControl: Provides the control-plane processes that interface between Cisco IOS Software and the rest of the platform.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)RPIOS: Provides the Cisco IOS Software kernel, which is where Cisco IOS Software features are stored and run; each consolidated image variant has a different RPIOS sub-package: RPIOS-ipbase, RPIOS-ipbasek9, RPIOS-advipservices, RPIOS-advipservicesk9, RPIOS-adventservices, and RPIOS-adventservicesk9.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The RPIOS-advipservices and RPIOS-adventservices sub-packages are only available beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1 and later releases. These two sub-packages are not available with Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.2 and earlier releases.

---

The individual software sub-packages within the consolidated packages cannot be downloaded from Cisco.com; only the Cisco IOS XE consolidated packages and optional sub-packages can be downloaded from Cisco.com. Users who want to run the router using individual software sub-packages must first download the consolidated package from Cisco.com and extract the individual software sub-packages from the consolidated package.

In addition to the individual software sub-packages within a consolidated package, optional software sub-packages that are not part of a consolidated package are available. Optional software sub-packages are downloaded separately from Cisco.com and their installation is similar to the installation of an individual software sub-package using a provisioning file. The optional sub-package must be located in the same directory with the provisioning file and the other individual sub-package files. The optional software sub-packages available vary based on the Route Processor (RP) installed in the system: RP1 or RP2:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For the RP1, the optional software sub-package available is the Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 WebEx Node (asr1000rp1-sipspawmak9.version.pkg)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For the RP2, the optional software sub-package available is the Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP2 WebEx Node (asr1000rp2-sipspawmak9.version.pkg)

### Cisco IOS XE Software Package Compatibility for ISSU

When upgrading the Cisco IOS XE operating system software using the In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) process, it is important to determine the compatibility of the upgraded software to your current software and hardware. The ISSU process allows software to be updated or otherwise modified while packet forwarding continues with minimal interruption.

Cisco IOS XE release compatibility using the ISSU process utilizes the SSO functionality to preserve state while software versions on the router differ, as during an upgrade. Most SSO-capable features in each Cisco IOS XE release are ISSU capable. ISSU is only supported if SSO is enabled in the configuration and the system is in a steady state (SSO ready state has been achieved). ISSU compatibility depends on the set of specific feature clients that are in use and whether they support ISSU. All ISSU upgrades include at least one IOS switchover operation. It is important to understand which features are in use and whether these features are ISSU compatible.

The Cisco ASR1006 Series Router is a hardware-redundant chassis. The hardware-redundant chassis has two ESP linecards and two RPs which exchange state using hardware links. The Cisco ASR1002 and ASR1004 Series Routers are not hardware redundant, but are software-redundancy capable. The non-redundant chassis has a single RP and a single ESP, but allows the operation of up to two IOS processes on the single RP to exchange states locally.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Non-hardware-redundant chassis models (such as the Cisco ASR 1002 Router and Cisco ASR 1004 Router)—Supports ISSU only if the router is running in subpackage mode.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Hardware-redundant chassis models (such as the Cisco ASR 1006 Router)—Supports ISSU when the router is running in sub-package mode or in consolidated package mode.

For a complete discussion about the ISSU upgrade process on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers, including prerequisites and restrictions, see the "[In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU)](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/configuration/guide/chassis/issu.html)" chapter of the [Cisco ASR 1000 Series Aggregation Services Software Configuration Guide.](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/configuration/guide/chassis/asrswcfg.html)

### Compatibility Support Policy

Rebuilds of a specific Cisco IOS XE release are intended to be fully ISSU and SSO capable for supported features between any two image pairings, however compatibility is not guaranteed for all releases. It is expected that rebuilds between release versions are compatible within a reasonable time frame.

### Support for Cisco IOS XE Rebuilds

The support policy for version rebuilds is as follows:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The immediate prior rebuild for the version is expected to be SSO and ISSU compatible with a new released rebuild of that version.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)A newly released rebuild is expected to be SSO and ISSU compatible with the current rebuild for the previous two versions.

As an example, a rebuild Y of version X is version XY. For rebuilds on the two previous versions of X, X-1 and X-2, it is expected that XY will be compatible with those versions.

### Support for Special Cisco IOS XE Releases

Certain special Cisco IOS XE software releases may be made from time to time. These releases are not specified in this document and any supported SSO or ISSU interoperability must be determined on a case by case basis.

### Cisco IOS XE Release Compatibility Tables

The ISSU compatibility tables in this section provide information about release pairs that are compatible and those that are not compatible for Cisco ASR1000 Series Routers. You can use this information to determine the impact of a Route Processor (RP) or Embedded Service Processor (ESP) switchover when the router is running a mixed combination of software as occurs during the whole-node ISSU procedures.

Non-SSO-capable features and non-ISSU-capable features are not included in the ISSU compatibility tables since these features lose state on any Cisco IOS XE switchover—RP switchover in the case of hardware-redundant chassis and software switchover on software-redundant chassis.

### Discussion of Table Fields

In the ISSU compatibility tables, the following information is provided:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)SSO

A Cisco IOS XE release stating :SSO" for all supported SSO-capable features is fully compatible for upgrades using ISSU, even if some of the SSO-capable features are not ISSU capable. Two different versions of the software are denoted as supporting SSO if they are able to reach an SSO state when run simultaneously, regardless of the impact on specific features.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)SSO Tested

A Cisco IOS XE release stating "SSO Tested" indicates that the two releases are fully tested and supported as interoperable and will retain state across a switchover. ISSU upgrades between the releases are supported.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)SSO via <release>

A Cisco IOS XE release stating "SSO via <release>" indicates that the two releases are not interoperable and must not be run simultaneously (must not be run at the same time on the two RPs of a hardware redundant chassis and must not be co-installed as subpackages on any chassis). However, an SSO path exists using the intermediate release that is specified.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Limited

A Cisco IOS XE release stating "Limited" indicates that the two releases have interoperability limitations. On the Cisco ASR1002 and Cisco ASR1004 routers. ISSU upgrade and downgrade are not supported. Instead you can perform a sub-package software upgrade. This process requires a RP reload.

The tables in the following sections list the compatibility of Cisco IOS XE software releases:

To correct this issue, perform an additional redundancy force-switchover after completing all steps of the ISSU procedure and after the device has reached SSO. Alternatively, a chassis reload also addresses the issue.  [3](#wp2997254) For the Cisco ASR 1002 Router and Cisco ASR 1004 Routers, when ISSU is used to upgrade router software, new features available in the new version are configurable as soon as the RP software portion of the update has been completed for both active and standby IOS. New features will be fully reflected in the operation of the router once the linecard images are also updated.

### RP Memory Recommendations

The Cisco IOS XE images and packages available vary based on the Route Processor (RP) installed in the system: RP1 or RP2.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Table 7](#wp2998161) describes the RP1 consolidated package images, their individual software sub-package contents, and their memory recommendations.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Table 9](#wp2998885) describes the RP1 optional sub-package images and their memory recommendations.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Table 9](#wp2998885) describes the RP2 consolidated package images, their individual software sub-package contents, and their memory recommendations.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Table 10](#wp2999494) describes the RP2 optional sub-package images and their memory recommendations.

Each Cisco IOS XE image also contains two provisioning files: asr1000rpx-packages.image.version.conf and packages.conf. A provisioning file is used for booting only in cases where the individual modules are extracted from the Cisco IOS XE image and then used to run the router. Either provisioning file can be used.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)No In Service Software Upgrade (ISSU) is possible between different image types.

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco IOS XE 2.3.0 and Cisco IOS XE 2.3.1 images are no longer downloadable from Cisco.com. Replacement images (Cisco IOS XE 2.3.0t and Cisco IOS XE 2.3.1t) with exactly the same content and bug fixes are available on Cisco.com. If the Cisco IOS XE 2.3.0 and Cisco IOS XE 2.3.1 images are not causing any issues, no action is necessary. Old image MD5 sums will still be available for verification on the download page. For more details, see CSCsz80074.

### Multicast Address Group Range Support

The Multicast Address Group Range Support feature enhances multicast access control by introducing the capability to define a global range of multicast groups and channels to be permitted or denied using the ip multicast group-range command.

For more information, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/2/release/notes/rnasr21.html)

### Multicast MIB VRF Support

The Multicast VRF MIB Support feature is an enhancement to help manage Cisco devices in a multicast VPN environment using SNMP.

This feature enhances the Cisco suite of supported multicast MIBs by making the following multicast MIBs MVRF aware:

CISCO-IPMROUTE-MIB

CISCO-PIM-MIB

IGMP-STD-MIB

IPMROUTE-STD-MIB

MSDP-MIB

PIM-MIB

Multicast VRF (MVRF) awareness enables the MIB objects associated with these Multicast MIBs to be queried and set for the individual MVRFs configured. In addition, MVRF awareness provides the capability to detect conditions for a trap inside of a MVRF and lookup the correct information for that MVRF; the traps would then be sent to the SNMP manager that is configured for that MVRF.

[For detailed information about these MIBs, and to locate and download MIBs for selected platforms, Cisco IOS XE releases, and feature sets, use Cisco MIB Locator found at http://www.cisco.com/go/mibs.](//www.cisco.com/go/mibs)

### 2547oDMVPN - Enabling Traffic Segmentation within DMVPN

Cisco IOS XE Release 2.5 provides an enhancement that allows you to segment VPN traffic within a DMVPN tunnel.

For more information, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/sec\_secure\_connectivity/configuration/guide/sec\_DMVPN\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/sec_secure_connectivity/configuration/guide/sec_DMVPN_xe.html)

### AAA - Improvements for Broadband IPv6

This feature is supported in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.5.

For more information, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/ipv6/configuration/guide/ip6-adsl\_dial\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/ipv6/configuration/guide/ip6-adsl_dial_xe.html)

### ANCP - ATM Support

You can enable ANCP support on an ATM interface by using the enable ancp command. This is one of the optional steps for configuring PVC.

For more information, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/atm/configuration/guide/atm\_cfg\_atm\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/atm/configuration/guide/atm_cfg_atm_xe.html)

### ATM F4 Ping

The F4 Operations, Administration, and Maintenance (OAM) Ping without Virtual Path (VP) Creation feature enables you to determine problems at the virtual path (VP) level using the ping command. Using

this feature, you can create and remove virtual circuit identifiers (VCIs) that correspond to the VP segment and the VP end, in the absence of VP configuration. After creating the VCIs you can use the ping atm command to isolate connection problems.

### ATM Sub-interface Multipoint

ATM supports two types of interfaces: point-to-point and multipoint.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Point-to-point subinterface—With point-to-point subinterfaces, each pair of routers has its own subnet. If you put the PVC on a point-to-point subinterface, the router assumes that there is only one point-to-point PVC configured on the subinterface. Therefore, any IP packets with a destination IP address in the same subnet are forwarded on this virtual circuit (VC). This is the simplest way to configure the mapping and is therefore the recommended method.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)- Multipoint networks—Multipoint networks have three or more routers in the same subnet. If you put the PVC in a point-to-multipoint subinterface or in the main interface (which is multipoint by default), you need to either configure a static mapping or enable inverse Address Resolution Protocol (ARP) for dynamic mapping.

For more information, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/atm/configuration/guide/atm\_cfg\_atm\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/atm/configuration/guide/atm_cfg_atm_xe.html)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[IPv6 IPSec Static Virtual Interface](#wp3002075)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[IPSec QoS Group-Based LLQ QoS](#wp3002081)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[ALG Support for SIP T.38 Fax Relay over IP](#wp3002088)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[ISIS Support for IPv6](#wp3002091)

### IPv6 IPSec Static Virtual Interface

Static Virtual Tunnel Interface (SVTI) configurations can be used for site-to-site connectivity in which a tunnel provides always-on access between two sites. The advantage of using SVTIs as opposed to map configurations is that users can enable dynamic routing protocols on the tunnel interface without the extra 24 bytes required for GRE headers, thus reducing the bandwidth for sending encrypted data.

For more information on SVTIs, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/ipv6/configuration/guide/ip6-ipsec\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/ipv6/configuration/guide/ip6-ipsec_xe.html)

### IPSec QoS Group-Based LLQ QoS

A limitation exists when IPSec and QoS are configured on an interface. IPSec uses the egress QoS policy to determine if a packet is a high priority packet before it enqueues it in a low latency queue (LLQ) of the crypto processor. For tunnel interfaces when the QoS policy is applied to the egress physical interface, Tunnel Protection is applied on the tunnel interface, and IPSec cannot determine if the packet is a high priority packet. In this scenario, high priority packets are queued to the default queue—increasing latency and traffic loss during oversubscription.

Starting with Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.1, QoS group-based LLQ for IPSec provides LLQ functionality before crypto for the limitation described earlier. The idea is to use QoS groups to identify high priority traffic in the IPSec module. Packets are marked with a QoS group at the ingress interface. The user designates certain QoS groups to be used as high priority before crypto.

A new IOS XE command allows the user to configure certain QoS groups as high priority for IPSec:

 [no] platform ipsec llq qos-group group\_num

This command specifies that packets with QoS group group\_num (allowed range 1 to 99) are to be treated as high priority packets before crypto and, therefore, are queued into a LLQ before reaching the crypto processor.

### ALG Support for SIP T.38 Fax Relay over IP

The SIP Application Layer Gateway has been enhanced to provide NAT and Firewall ALG support for T.38 Fax Relay over IP.

### ISIS Support for IPv6

Intermediate System (IS-IS) has been enhanced to provide Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6).

### New Hardware Features in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.0

The following new hardware features are supported by the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.0:

### New Shared Port Adapters

Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.0 introduces support for the following new shared port adapters (SPAs):

POS SPAs

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)8-Port OC-3 POS SPA (SPA-8XOC3-POS)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)2-Port, 4-Port, and 8-Port OC-12 POS SPAs (SPA-2XOC12-POS, SPA-4XOC12-POS, and SPA-8X0C-12-POS)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)1-Port OC-48 POS SPA (SPA-1XOC48POS/RPR)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)1-Port OC-192 POS SPA (SPA-OC192POS-XFP)

Services SPA

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco WebEx Node for ASR 1000 Series (SPA-WMA-K9)

The Cisco WebEx Node for ASR 1000 Series is a full-height SPA designed to run an application which is part of the WebEx MediaTone network management application. The Cisco WebEx Node for ASR 1000 Series improves the functionality of WebEx meeting services by adding the meeting servers into the SPA itself. This technology provides the following advantages:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Improves performance for users inside the company firewall.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Reduces the bandwidth going out of company firewall (to the WebEx MediaTone network).

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Provides better security by reducing traffic outside the company.

By moving the switching components of the WebEx Collaboration Cloud into the Cisco WebEx Node for ASR 1000 Series, the WebEx clients in the enterprise network need only connect to the Cisco WebEx Node for ASR 1000 Series. This reduces the traffic between the enterprise network and the WebEx MediaTone network, greatly reducing the customer's Internet bandwidth requirements.

Each Cisco WebEx Node for ASR 1000 Series can be configured to perform either web conferencing or voice and video conferencing, but not both features at the same time. Each Cisco WebEx Node for ASR 1000 Series uses the same software package that includes both features; the conferencing feature that actually runs on each SPA is determined by the WebEx Service Plan the customer has purchased. The WebEx MediaTone network retains the Cisco WebEx Node for ASR 1000 Series configuration files that the SPA retrieves each time the SPA boots. Multiple Cisco WebEx Nodes for ASR 1000 Series can be installed on the same Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router chassis to increase the conferencing performance or to provide conferencing coverage for both web and voice and video sessions.

For information about the SPAs supported on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers, see the following documents:

### IS-IS Support for IPv6

Intermediate System-to-Intermediate System (IS-IS) has been enhanced to support Internet Protocol version 6 (IPv6). For more information on implementing IS-IS support, see the Cisco IOS XE IPv6 Configuration Guide, Release 2 at the following URL:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/ipv6/configuration/guide/ip6-is-is\_xe\_ps9587\_TSD\_Products\_Configuration\_Guide\_Chapter.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/ipv6/configuration/guide/ip6-is-is_xe_ps9587_TSD_Products_Configuration_Guide_Chapter.html)

### 3 Level Egress QoS Policy

The 3 Level Egress QoS Policy feature allows 3 level hierarchical QoS policies to be applied as an egress service per physical interface or per VLAN (GE) or per subinterface (FR or serial).

At the top level, only class-default with shaping can be configured.

At the medium level, user defined classes can be configured where for each user defined class following can be applied:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Bandwidth Remaining (BR): either as Bandwidth Remaining Ratio (BRR) or Bandwidth Remaining Percentage (BRP) or

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif) shaping or

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)priority (conditional or unconditional policer)

All of the three items listed above can be configured concurrently with WRED.

At the bottom level, user defined classes can be configured where for each user defined class either policing or marking can be applied.

### 802.1P CoS Bit Set for PPP and PPPoE Control Frames

The 802.1P CoS Bit Set for PPP and PPPoE Control Frames feature provides the ability to set user priority bits in the IEEE 802.1Q tagged frame to allow traffic prioritization.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/bbdsl/configuration/guide/bba\_cos\_ppp\_pppoe\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/bbdsl/configuration/guide/bba_cos_ppp_pppoe_xe.html)

### AAA Interim Accounting

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec\_user\_services/configuration/guide/sec\_cfg\_accountg.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_user_services/configuration/guide/sec_cfg_accountg.html)

### ACL—Template ACL/12 Bit ACE

The Template ACL feature groups ACLs with many common access control elements (ACEs) into a single ACL that saves system resources.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec\_data\_plane/configuration/guide/sec\_tmplacl.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_data_plane/configuration/guide/sec_tmplacl.html)

### ANCP (Access Node Control Protocol)

The Access Node Control Protocol feature enhances communication between Digital Subscriber Line Access Multiplexers (DSLAMs) and a broadband remote access server (BRAS), enabling the exchange of events, actions, and information requests between the multiplexer end and the server end. As a result, either end can implement appropriate actions.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/ancp/configuration/guide/ancp\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/ancp/configuration/guide/ancp_xe.html)

### ANCP Phase 2.5

The ANCP Phase 2.5 feature allows multiple services to be activated or deactivated by a single Change of Authorization (CoA) message sent from the policy server.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/ancp/configuration/guide/ancp\_msad\_coa\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/ancp/configuration/guide/ancp_msad_coa_xe.html)

### Any Transport over MPLS (AToM): Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS)

The Any Transport over MPLS (AToM): Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) feature allows you to transport Layer 2 Ethernet VLAN packets from various sources over an MPLS backbone. Ethernet over MPLS extends the usability of the MPLS backbone by enabling it to offer Layer 2 services in addition to already existing Layer 3 services.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/mpls/configuration/guide/mp\_any\_transport\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/mpls/configuration/guide/mp_any_transport_xe.html)

### Any Transport over MPLS (AToM): Ethernet over MPLS: Port Mode (EoMPLS)

Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) is the transport of Ethernet frames across an MPLS core. It transports all frames received on a particular Ethernet or virtual LAN (VLAN) segment, regardless of the destination Media Access Control (MAC) information.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/mpls/configuration/guide/mp\_any\_transport\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/mpls/configuration/guide/mp_any_transport_xe.html)

### Any Transport over MPLS (AToM): Remote Ethernet Port Shutdown

The Any Transport over MPLS (AToM): Remote Ethernet Port Shutdown feature allows a service provider edge (PE) router on the local end of an Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) pseudowire to detect a remote link failure and cause the shutdown of the Ethernet port on the local customer edge (CE) router. Because the Ethernet port on the local CE router is shut down, the router does not lose data by continuously sending traffic to the failed remote link.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/mpls/configuration/guide/mp\_any\_transport\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/mpls/configuration/guide/mp_any_transport_xe.html)

### Any Transport over MPLS— Ethernet over MPLS Enhancements: Fast Reroute

The Any Transport over MPLS— Ethernet over MPLS Enhancements: Fast Reroute feature allows AToM to use MPLS traffic engineering (TE) tunnels with fast reroute (FRR) support. This feature enhances FRR functionality for Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS).

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/mpls/configuration/guide/mp\_any\_transport\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/mpls/configuration/guide/mp_any_transport_xe.html)

### Asynchronous Rotary Line Queuing

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/dial/configuration/guide/dia\_asyn\_que\_role.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/dial/configuration/guide/dia_asyn_que_role.html)

### Byte-Based Weighted Random Early Detection

The Byte-Based Weighted Random Early Detection feature extends the functionality of WRED. In previous releases, you specified the WRED actions based on the number of packets. With the Byte-Based WRED, you can specify WRED actions based on the number of bytes.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/qos/configuration/guide/fsbyte\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/qos/configuration/guide/fsbyte_xe.html)

### Cache Control Enhancements for Certification Revocation Lists

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec\_secure\_connectivity/configuration/guide/sec\_cfg\_auth\_rev\_cert.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_secure_connectivity/configuration/guide/sec_cfg_auth_rev_cert.html)

### Certificate—Complete Chain Validation

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec\_secure\_connectivity/configuration/guide/sec\_cfg\_auth\_rev\_cert.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/sec_secure_connectivity/configuration/guide/sec_cfg_auth_rev_cert.html)

### Cisco IOS SHA2 Support

The Cisco IOS SHA2 Support feature allows the user to specify a cryptographic hash function for Cisco IOS certificate servers and clients. The cryptographic hash functions that can be specified are Message-Digest algorithm 5 (MD5), Secure Hash Algorithm -- SHA-1, SHA-256, SHA-384, or SHA-512.

The following commands were introduced by this feature: hash (ca-trustpoint) and hash (cs-server). The hash (ca-trustpoint) command sets the hash function for the signature that the Cisco IOS client uses to sign its self-signed certificates. The hash (cs-server) command sets the hash function for the signature that the Cisco IOS certificate authority (CA) uses to sign all of the certificates issued by the server.

### Cisco Unified Border Element (SP Edition)

Cisco Unified Border Element (SP Edition) was formerly known as Integrated Session Border Controller.

With Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.0, Cisco Unified Border Element (SP Edition) can operate in two modes or deployment models:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Unified—In the unified model, both the SBE and DBE logical entities co-exist on the same network element. In this model, the signaling entity controls the media local to the router.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Distributed—In the distributed model, the SBE and the DBE entities reside on different network elements. Logically, each of the SBE entities controls multiple DBE elements, and each DBE can be controlled by multiple SBE entities.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3 and earlier releases of the Integrated Session Border Controller, only DBEs in the distributed model are supported.

---

In addition to introducing support for the SBC unified model, Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.0 introduces support for the following Session Border Controller (SBC) features:

### Etherchannel Flow Based Limited 1:1 Redundancy

The EtherChannel Flow-Based Limited 1:1 Redundancy feature provides a way to configure load balancing at the port-channel level based on different flows of traffic. You can identify different flows of traffic based on key fields in the data packet and balance the traffic load according to those traffic flows. To use EtherChannel flow-based limited 1:1 redundancy, you configure an EtherChannel with two ports (one active and one standby). If the active link goes down, the EtherChannel stays up and the system performs fast switchover to the hot-standby link. When the failed link becomes operational again, the EtherChannel performs another fast switchover to revert to the original active link.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/lanswitch/configuration/guide/lsw\_cfg\_flwbal.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/lanswitch/configuration/guide/lsw_cfg_flwbal.html)

### Per Subinterface MTU for Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS)

The Per Subinterface MTU for Ethernet over MPLS (EoMPLS) feature provides you with the ability to specify maximum transmission unit (MTU) values in xconnect subinterface configuration mode. When you use xconnect subinterface configuration mode to set the MTU value, you establish a pseudowire connection for situations where the interfaces have different MTU values that cannot be changed.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/mpls/configuration/guide/mp\_any\_transport\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/mpls/configuration/guide/mp_any_transport_xe.html)

### PKI—CLI to Control Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Cache

The PKI-CLI to Control Certificate Revocation List (CRL) Cache feature allows the administrator to control the CRL cache size. CRLs are received by Cisco IOS software in Distinguished Encoding Rules (DER) encoded format. Because processing a DER encoded CRL uses CPU memory, Cisco IOS software allows CRLs either to be stored in cache after being processed or to be decoded. Configuring the CRL cache size allows the amount of memory to be decreased (for example, if low memory conditions exist) or to be increased (for example, when a large number of CRLs are being processed), resulting in better performance.

The following commands were introduced or modified by this feature: crypto pki crl cache and show crypto pki crls. The crypto pki crl cache command allows the administrator to set the maximum amount of volatile memory used to cache CRLs. When the crypto pki crl cache command is configured, the show crypto pki crls command output includes information on the CRL cache size.

### ATM MIB Enhancements

The Cisco AAL5 MIB adds a proprietary extension to the standard ATM MIB (RFC 1695) to provide per-VC statistic counters that are currently displayed in response to the Cisco IOS show atm vc command for a specified virtual circuit. This MIB extension allows SNMP network management system applications to query the same variables (SNMP objects) as those that can be gathered from the Cisco IOS command- line interface.

The Cisco AAL5 MIB provides SNMP access to four new statistics counters defined for AAL5 virtual connections: incoming packet counter, outgoing packet counter, incoming octet counter, and outgoing octet counter. The Cisco AAL5 MIB groups these four counters in a table called cAal5VccTable.

The proprietary extension of the Cisco AAL5 MIB supports all the tables and objects defined in the Cisco AAL5 MIB for ATM interfaces acting as endpoints of ATM connections that run Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3 software and later releases.

### New Cisco ASR 1000 Embedded Services Processors

Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1 introduces support for the following new Embedded Services Processors (ESPs):

### Cisco ASR 1000 Embedded Services Processor 10G Non Crypto Capable

The Cisco ASR 1000 Embedded Services Processor 10G Non Crypto Capable (Cisco ASR1000-ESP10-N) is a non-crypto capable version of the encryption-enabled 10-Gbps Cisco ASR 1000 Series ESP (Cisco ASR1000-ESP10).

The Cisco ASR 1000 Embedded Services Processor 10G Non Crypto Capable provides a Cisco ASR 1000 solution for customers who are under export restrictions and not qualified to implement products that support strong encryption services. The Cisco ASR 1000 Embedded Services Processor 10G Non Crypto Capable feature support is the same as the 10-Gbps Cisco ASR 1000 Series ESP except that IPSec and other data-plane cryptographic features are not supported.

The Cisco ASR 1000 Embedded Services Processor 10G Non Crypto Capable is supported on all Cisco ASR 1000 Series chassis but should only be used with following consolidated packages that do not contain cryptographic (K9) software:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 IP BASE W/O CRYPTO

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 ADVANCED IP SERVICES W/O CRYPTO

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 ADVANCED ENTERPRISE SERVICES W/O CRYPTO

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 IP BASE W/O CRYPTO, Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 ADVANCED IP SERVICES W/O CRYPTO, and Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 ADVANCED ENTERPRISE SERVICES W/O CRYPTO consolidated packages do not require export qualification and can also run on the encryption-enabled 10-Gbps Cisco ASR 1000 Series ESP. The K9-based consolidated packages (Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 IP BASE, Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 ADVANCED IP SERVICES and Cisco ASR 1000 Series RP1 ADVANCED ENTERPRISE SERVICES) will never be supported on the Cisco ASR 1000 Embedded Services Processor 10G Non Crypto Capable hardware.

---

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Embedded Services Processor 10G Non Crypto Capable should never be inserted into a chassis using K9 software or the router may reload.

---

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Embedded Services Processor 10G Non Crypto Capable and 10-Gbps Cisco ASR 1000 Series ESP should not be mixed in a hardware-redundant chassis.

### 20-Gbps Cisco ASR 1000 Series ESP

The 20-Gbps Cisco ASR 1000 Series ESP (Cisco ASR1000-ESP20) supports 20-Gbps bandwidth and is supported on the Cisco ASR 1004 and Cisco ASR 1006 chassis. It can optionally be deployed in customer networks that require 1+1 redundancy on Cisco ASR 1006 Routers. Performance highlights of the 20-Gbps ESP include hardware-assisted policing, encryption capability of 8 Gbps, 16 Mpps forwarding, 256MB of packet memory, 1GB (bytes) of resource memory performance, and special jitter- and latency-minimizing multicast packet replication.

### AAA Broadcast Accounting

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/security/configuration/guide/sec\_cfg\_accountg.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/security/configuration/guide/sec_cfg_accountg.html)

### Bidirectional PIM

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ipmulti/configuration/guide/imc\_basic\_cfg.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ipmulti/configuration/guide/imc_basic_cfg.html)

### Cisco Firewall and WAAS Inter-Op

The Cisco Firewall and WAAS Interoperability feature enables a router configured with a firewall to successfully communicate with a cache engine, such as a Wide Area Application Acceleration (WAAS) device that is using the Web Cache Communication Protocol (WCCP).

WAAS optimizes remote access to applications.When the cache engine is a WAAS device, it can optimize TCP flow by modifying TCP headers. During the TCP three-way handshake, the WAAS device can add an extra TCP option in the header to indicate that the flow will be optimized. When the TCP session is established, the WAAS device can modify the sequence and acknowledge number in the TCP header to optimize the data flow.

When a Cisco firewall is configured on the router, the packets have to be inspected by the firewall. Depending on the deployment scenario, the firewall inspects packets as follows:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For client-to-server packets, the firewall inspects packets in the redirect path and ignores packets in the return path.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For server-to-client packets, the firewall inspects packets in the return path and ignores packets in the redirect path.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)If the firewall encounters a TCP SYN packet with the 0x21 option, the firewall knows that this packet is already a WAAS flow. The firewall will adjust the Layer 4 state to reflect the 2-GB jump in sequence and acknowledge numbers. No Layer 7 inspection will be applied to the flow.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Although the firewall will ignore the same packets in either the redirect or the return path, the firewall must still perform a session lookup to get the information about the direction of the packet (from client to server or server to client).

This feature has the following restrictions:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Only Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) redirect and return is supported. Layer 2 redirect and return is not supported.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Certain platforms, such as the Cisco 2800 series, support an inbox network service module (WAAS-NM) that provides WAAS services. The Cisco ASR 1000 series routers do not support inbox network service modules; thus, the router will not support WAAS-NM.

### Class-Based Marking

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/qos/configuration/guide/mrkg\_netwk\_traffic.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/qos/configuration/guide/mrkg_netwk_traffic.html)

### Class Based Weighted Fair Queuing (CBWFQ)

CBWFQ extends the standard weighted fair queueing (WFQ) functionality to provide support for user-defined traffic classes. For CBWFQ, you define traffic classes based on match criteria such as protocols, access control lists (ACLs), and input interfaces.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/qos/configuration/guide/config\_wfq.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/qos/configuration/guide/config_wfq.html)

### Control Plane Policing (CoPP)

### Integrated Session Border Controller

Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1 introduces support for the following new Integrated Session Border Controller (SBC) features:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Full Support for Wildcard Response](#wp3004313)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[H.248 Protocol—Acknowledgment Support for Three-Way Handshake](#wp3004316)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[H.248 ServiceChange Handoff](#wp3004319)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Improved Media Timeout Detection](#wp3004322)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Interim Authentication Header Full Support](#wp3004325)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[IPSec Pinhole Support—Twice NAT for IPv4 and No NAT for IPv6](#wp3004328)

### Full Support for Wildcard Response

Previously Session Border Controller (SBC) supported H.248 wildcard operations that were restricted to W-Modify or W-Subtract requests, which yielded summary wildcard responses. This feature introduces support for a complete wildcard response. A wildcard H.248 Subtract or Modify operation now returns a complete response with per-termination statistics.

### H.248 Protocol—Acknowledgment Support for Three-Way Handshake

The data border element (DBE) supports a three-way handshake for H.248 messages. The DBE supports sending of an acknowledgement for a three-way handshake after receiving the transaction response from the media gateway controller (MGC), as described in Annex D.1.2 and Annex D.1.2.2 of H.248.1 v3 Gateway Control Protocol.

### H.248 ServiceChange Handoff

The ServiceChange Handoff functionality on Integrated Session Border Controller conforms to section 7.2.8, ServiceChange, and section 7.2.8.1.1, ServiceChangeMethod, of the H.248.1 v3 Gateway Control Protocol. The ServiceChange Handoff functionality allows a media gateway controller (MGC) to hand over control of a media gateway (MG) to another MGC. The MGC sends a ServiceChange message to the MG that it is currently associated with to request that the MG terminate that association and the MG form a new association with an MGC identified in the ServiceChange message.

### Improved Media Timeout Detection

In the previous media timeout functionality on the data border element (DBE), if no SBC packets have been seen by the configured number of seconds since the call has been established, then the DBE generates a media timeout alert to the SBE. The Improved Media Timeout Detection feature delays reporting of the media timeout event by instructing the DBE to wait until it has received the first packet since the call has been established. Only then does the media timeout timer start counting the number of seconds for which it has not seen an SBC packet. At the end of the count, the DBE generates an alert to the SBE.

### Interim Authentication Header Full Support

Integrated SBC offers full support of Interim Authentication Header (IAH) that conforms to section 10.2, Interim AH Scheme, of the H.248.1 v3 Gateway Control Protocol. An IAH is part of every H.248 message generated by the data border element (DBE) to the media gateway controller (MGC). Information in the IAH is used to authenticate and check the integrity of packets, thus ensuring packet security. The DBE generates an IAH for outgoing H.248 messages and can verify the Authentication Header for incoming H.248 messages. The IAH scheme inserts the IAH within the H.248.1 protocol header.

### IPSec Pinhole Support—Twice NAT for IPv4 and No NAT for IPv6

The IPSec Pinhole Support—Twice NAT for IPv4 and No NAT for IPv6 feature adds support for voice calls over IPSec tunnels and adds support for IPSec address-only pinholes. This support enables the DBE to forward IPSec packets when the port cannot be determined because the port is within the encrypted portion of the frame. Thus, IPSec support handles the IPSec requirement that does not allow use of port numbers for session lookup or translation. Currently single IPSec pinholes are supported, whereby both IKE and the encrypted IPSec traffic passes through the same pinhole.

### L3 MPLS VPN Over GRE

L3 MPLS VPN over GRE provides a mechanism for tunneling Multi Protocol Label Switching (MPLS) packets over a non-MPLS network.

The L3 MPLS VPN over GRE feature utilizes MPLS over Generic Routing Encapsulation (MPLSoGRE) to encapsulate MPLS packets inside IP tunnels; thus creating a virtual point-to-point link across non-MPLS networks. This allows users of primarily MPLS networks to continue to use existing non-MPLS legacy networks until migration to MPLS is possible.

### Per Subscriber Firewall on LNS

The Per-Subscriber Firewall on LNS feature enables the zone-based policy firewall configuration model to be implemented on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router. Zone-based policy firewall is a unidirectional firewall policy between groups of interfaces known as zones. (Previously, Cisco firewalls were configured as an inspect rule only on interfaces. Traffic entering or leaving the configured interface was inspected based on the direction that the inspect rule was applied.) Now, interfaces are assigned to zones, and inspection policies are applied to traffic moving between the zones. Interzone policies offer considerable flexibility and granularity, so different inspection policies can be applied to multiple host groups connected to the same router interface.

In addition to the zone-based policy firewall model, the Per-Subscriber Firewall on LNS feature introduces the following additional functionality for the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Dynamic zone assignment for virtual access interfaces

Subscribers can be assigned to a zone in one of two ways:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Using the configuration on the virtual-template interface, which can be useful when placing subscribers in a default zone.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Using the RADIUS vendor-specific attribute (VSA), which enables zone assignment to be determined when the session is authorized.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)PPP session-level granularity for zone-based policy firewall

Stateful inspection and application monitoring occur at the PPP session, enabling the full suite of firewall and broadband features to be applied per subscriber, simultaneously. That is, extra routers or service blades are not required to support the firewall functionality. The firewall functionality is applied by the packet processor engine (PPE) in the forwarding path for broadband traffic.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Per-subscriber drop log messages

Service providers can track drops on a per-subscriber basis by including the subscriber's username in the drop log messages. These drop log messages can also be sent to an off-box server for additional processing.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Zone pairs with matching source and destination zones

Service providers can customize the firewall policy for traffic between subscribers in the same zone. Customization is useful for overriding the default behavior, which is the passage of all traffic within the same zone.

### DHCP—DHCPv6 Relay Agent Notification for Prefix Delegation

The DHCP—DHCPv6 Relay Agent Notification for Prefix Delegation feature allows the router working as a DHCPv6 relay agent to find prefix delegation options by reviewing the contents of a DHCPv6 packet that is being relayed by the relay agent to the client.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ipv6/configuration/guide/ip6-dhcp.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ipv6/configuration/guide/ip6-dhcp.html)

### DHCP Relay Server ID Override and Link Selection Option 82 Suboptions

The DHCP Relay Server ID Override and Link Selection Option 82 Suboptions feature enables the relay agent to be part of all DHCP message exchanges by supporting the use of two suboptions of the relay agent information option (option 82). This design allows DHCPv4 to operate in networks where direct communication between the client and server is not possible or desired. When used together, these two suboptions enable the deployment of an architecture where it is desirable to have all DHCP traffic flow through the relay agent, allowing for greater control of DHCP communications.

This feature also introduces the capability to manually configure the interface for the relay agent to use as the source IP address for messages relayed to the DHCP server. This configuration allows the network administrator to specify a stable, hardware-independent IP address (such as a loopback interface).

### Integrated Session Border Controller

The Integrated Session Border Controller (SBC) is introduced on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers. The Integrated SBC is integrated with other features on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers, without requiring additional application-specific hardware, such as service blades, or the need to create an overlay network of standalone SBC appliances.

Session border controllers are used as key components in interconnecting Voice over IP (VoIP) and multimedia networks of different enterprise customers and service providers. SBCs are deployed at the edge of networks to meet the need for secure, intelligent border element functions. Using SBCs, the end user can make voice and video calls to another end user without being concerned about protocols, network reachability, or safety of the network.

The SBC enables direct IP-to-IP interconnect between multiple administrative domains for session-based services providing protocol and signaling interworking, security, Quality of Service (QoS), network hiding, statistics gathering, and admission control and management.

Currently the data border element (DBE) functionality of the Integrated Session Border Controller is supported on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers.

### IPv6: NSF and Graceful Restart for MP-BGP IPv6 Address Family

The IPv6: NSF and Graceful Restart for MP-BGP IPv6 Address Family feature adds graceful restart capability support for IPv6 BGP unicast, multicast, and VPNv6 address families, enabling Cisco nonstop forwarding (NSF) functionality for BGP IPv6. The BGP graceful restart capability allows the BGP routing table to be recovered from peers without keeping the TCP state.

### MQC—Distribution of Remaining Bandwidth Using Ratio

The MQC—Distribution of Remaining Bandwidth Using Ratio feature allows service providers to configure a bandwidth-remaining ratio on subinterfaces and class queues. This ratio specifies the relative weight of a subinterface or queue with respect to other subinterfaces or queues. During congestion, the router uses this bandwidth-remaining ratio to determine the amount of excess bandwidth (unused by priority traffic) to allocate to a class of nonpriority traffic.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/qos/configuration/guide/bwdth\_remain\_ratio.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/qos/configuration/guide/bwdth_remain_ratio.html)

### PPPoE Session Limit Local Override

The PPPoE Session Limit Local Override feature enables the session limit configured locally on the broadband remote access server (BRAS) or L2TP access concentrator (LAC) to override the per-NAS-port session limit downloaded from the RADIUS server when Subscriber Service Switch (SSS) preauthorization is enabled.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

### Quality of Service for Gigabit EtherChannels

The Quality of Service: Policies Aggregation feature allows the default traffic classes of different policy maps on the same physical interface to be configured as a single traffic class within the Modular QoS CLI. The Quality of Service for Gigabit EtherChannels feature extends the functionality introduced in the Quality of Service: Policies Aggregation feature by allowing the default traffic classes of different member links in the same Gigabit EtherChannel bundle to be configured as a single traffic class within the Modular QoS CLI.

This feature is documented as part of the Quality of Service: Policies Aggregation feature.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

### VLAN Mapping to GEC Member Links

The VLAN Mapping to GEC Member Links feature allows for the static assignment of user traffic as identified by a VLAN ID to a given member link of a GEC bundle. Network administrators can manually assign VLAN subinterfaces to a primary and secondary link. Load balancing to downstream equipment can be configured, regardless of the downstream equipment capabilities, and will provide failover protection by redirecting traffic to the secondary member link if the primary link fails. Member links are supported with up to 16 bundles per chassis.

For information about this feature, see the following document:

### 8-Way CEF Load Balancing

Destination IP prefixes are added to the routing table by routing protocols or static routes. Each path is a valid route to reach the destination prefix. The set of active paths is the set of paths with the best cost. Cisco Express Forwarding load balancing is the ability to share the traffic to a destination prefix over up to eight active paths (an increase from the previous support of six active paths). Load among the active paths can be distributed per destination.

### BGP Reduction in Transient Memory Usage

The BGP Reduction in Transient Memory Usage feature implements a reduction in transient memory usage by BGP when BGP updates are built in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.

### CEF Support for IP Routing Between IEEE 802.1 Q VLANs

Cisco Express Forwarding (CEF) is supported on interfaces on which IEEE 802.1Q encapsulation has been enabled at the subinterface level. You no longer have to disable CEF operation on interfaces that are using IEEE 802.1Q encapsulation on VLAN subinterfaces.

### Class-Based Quality of Service Management Information Base

The Class-Based Quality of Service Management Information Base (Class-Based QoS MIB) provides read access to class-based QoS configurations. This MIB also provides QoS statistics information based on the Modular QoS CLI, including information regarding class map and policy map parameters.

This Class-Based QoS MIB is actually two MIBs: CISCO-CLASS-BASED-QOS-MIB and CISCO-CLASS-BASED-QOS-CAPABILITY-MIB.

### Compression Control

The PPP Compression Control Protocol (CCP) defines a method for negotiating data compression over PPP links. These links can be either leased lines or circuit switched WAN links such as ISDN. PPP CCP allows vendors to support multiple data compression algorithms.

### DLR Enhancements: PGM RFC-3208 Compliance

In compliance with RFC 3208, the DLR Enhancements: PGM RFC-3208 Compliance feature adds off-tree designated local repairer (DLR) support and redirecting poll response (POLR) capability for upstream DLRs to the Cisco implementation of Pragmatic General Multicast (PGM).

### Frame Relay FRF.1.2 Annex A Support

The FRF.1.2 Annex A Support feature is also called Local Management Interface (LMI) segmentation. It supports an enhancement to the Frame Relay LMI protocol where LMI full status messages are segmented because of MTU constraints or large numbers of permanent virtual circuits (PVCs). This feature is useful when the maximum MTU size is insufficient to accommodate the large number of PVCs on the link. During Frame Relay internetworking with other Layer 2 protocols, the MTUs on each interface must match. In software without the FRF.1.2 Annex A Support feature, you cannot change the MTU size on the Frame Relay side and place all PVC data into one LMI packet. The FRF.1.2 Annex A Support feature removes this limitation.

The FRF.1.2 Annex A standard adds a new message type "Full status continued" to an LMI packet. When a DCE determines that it cannot fit all PVCs into one packet (enforced by the MTU size), the message type is set to "Full status continued." The DTE responds to "Full status continued" messages that are sent to this packet immediately instead of waiting for the T391 timer to expire. The DCE sends the remaining PVCs in one or more "Full status continued" messages until all the remaining PVCs can fit into one message. At this point, a normal "Full status" message is sent.

If the DTE receives a "Full status" or "Full status continued" STATUS message in response to a "Full status continued" STATUS ENQUIRY message, this exchange indicates a lower-valued data-link connection identifier (DLCI) than the prior "Full status continued" STATUS message (and is considered to be an error event), and PVC information elements (IEs) are not processed. The next time the T391 timer expires, the "Full status" STATUS ENQUIRY procedure is reinitiated.

This feature follows the FRF.1.2 implement agreement [1] and allows Cisco IOS software to be compliant with the FRF.1.2 standard. The implementation is platform-independent and applies to all platforms running Cisco IOS software that support Frame Relay. This feature interoperates only with existing Cisco IOS software releases where all PVCs can be reported in one packet. A router running the new functionality must be able to interoperate with routers running existing Cisco IOS software releases and with routers that support the new functionality using the continuation status request and reply frames. Only LMI types Q.933A and ANSI support the FRF.1.2 Annex A standard.

You can track "Full status continued" packets by using the debug frame-relay lmi command in privileged EXEC mode. An extra field, 04, has been added to the display output. The following example indicates where in the report to look for this field (the text is in bold for this example):

```
17:42:39: Serial1(out): StEnq, myseq 126, yourseen 125, DTE up

```

```
17:42:39: datagramstart = 0x40058DA4, datagramsize = 13

```

```
17:42:39: FR encap = 0x00010308

```

```
17:42:39: 00 75 51 01 04 53 02 7E 7D

```

```

```

The string segment "active/inactive" in the display of the show interface commands indicates whether the FRF.1.2 Annex A standard is triggered. The report indicates active when routers receive the "Full status continued" message; otherwise, the report indicates inactive.

### Interfaces MIB: SNMP Context Based Access

The Interfaces MIB (IF-MIB) has been modified to support context-aware packet information in Virtual Route Forwarding (VRF) environments. VRF environments require that contexts apply to Virtual Private Networks (VPNs) so that clients can be given selective access to the information stored in the IF-MIB. Clients that belong to a particular VRF can access information about the interface from the IF-MIB that belongs to that VRF only. When a client tries to get information from an interface that is associated with a particular context, the client can see only the information that belongs to that context and cannot see IF-MIB information that is associated with interfaces that are connected to another VRF to which it is not entitled. No commands have been modified or added to support this feature.

The IF-MIB supports all tables that are defined in RFC 2863 and the CISCO-IFEXTENSION-MIB.

### ISSU - IGMP Snooping

This ISSU - IGMP Snooping feature adds ISSU support for IGMP Snooping.

### NAT—Performance Enhancement - Translation Table Optimization

The NAT - Performance Enhancement - Translation Table Optimization feature provides greater structure for storing translation table entries and an optimized look up in the table for associating table entries to IP connections.

### Parse Bookmarks

The Parse Bookmarks feature quickly processes consecutive similar commands, such as access-lists and prefix-lists, up to five times faster. The Parse Bookmarks feature reduces boot time and load time for large configurations with many similar consecutive commands. This feature is an enhancement to the parsing algorithm; therefore no configuration changes are needed.

### PPPoE Over Gigabit Ethernet Interface

The PPPoE over Gigabit Ethernet Interface feature enhances PPP over Ethernet (PPPoE) functionality by adding support for PPPoE and PPPoE over IEEE 802.1Q VLANs on Gigabit Ethernet interfaces.

### RADIUS Attribute 52 and 53 Gigaword Support

The RADIUS Attribute 52 and Attribute 53 Gigaword Support feature introduces support for Attribute 52 (Acct-Input-Gigawords) and Attribute 53 (Acct-Output-Gigawords) in accordance with RFC 2869. Attribute 52 keeps track of the number of times the Acct-Input-Octets counter has rolled over the 32-bit integer throughout the course of the provided service; attribute 53 keeps track of the number of times the Acct-Output-Octets counter has rolled over the 32-bit integer throughout the delivery of service. Both attributes can be present only in Accounting-Request records where the Acct-Status-Type is set to "Stop" or "Interim-Update." These attributes can be used to keep accurate track of and bill for usage.

### RADIUS Attribute 77 for DSL

The RADIUS Attribute 77 for DSL feature introduces support for attribute 77 (Connect-Info) to carry the textual name of the virtual circuit class associated with the given permanent virtual circuit (PVC). (Although attribute 77 does not carry the unspecified bit rate (UBR), the UBR can be inferred from the classname used if one UBR is set up on each class.) Attribute 77 is sent from the network access server (NAS) to the RADIUS server via Accounting-Request and Accounting-Response packets.

### Selective Packet Discard (SPD)

When in severe overload conditions, routers that cannot keep up with the incoming packet stream must drop packets. If no intelligence is applied to choosing which ones to discard, this will impact the stability of routing protocols. This feature applies some simple choices to selectively discard packets likely to be unimportant for routing and interface stability. SPD is enabled by default; there are no commands or configuration tasks required.

### TCP MIB for RFC4022 Support

The TCP MIB for RFC 4022 Support feature introduces support for RFC 4022, Management Information Base for the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP). RFC 4022 is an incremental change of the TCP MIB to improve the manageability of TCP.

To locate and download MIBs for selected platforms, Cisco IOS releases, and feature sets, use Cisco MIB Locator found at the following URL:

### VPN Routing Forwarding (VRF) Framed Route (Pool) Assignment via PPP

The VPN Routing Forwarding (VRF) Framed Route (Pool) Assignment via PPP feature introduces support to make the following RADIUS attributes VRF aware: attribute 22 (Framed-Route), a combination of attribute 8 (Framed-IP-Address) and attribute 9 (Framed-IP-Netmask), and the Cisco VSA route command. Thus, static IP routes can be applied to a particular VRF routing table rather than the global routing table.

## Limitations and Restrictions

This section lists the limitations and restrictions that apply to the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers for Cisco IOS XE Release 2 and contains the following sections:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Limitations and Restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.0](#wp3005323)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Limitations and Restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.3](#wp3005341)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Limitations and Restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.0](#wp3005403)

### Limitations and Restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.0

This section describes limitations and restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.0 and later releases.

### User-Defined Parent Class Limitation (for Hierarchical QoS)

On a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router with hierarchical QoS and user-defined parent classes applied, each child policy must be a unique policy map. The use of a single child policy map in multiple instances in the definition of a user-defined parent class is not supported in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.0. For more details, see CSCsr56079.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The User-Defined Parent Class Limitation (for Hierarchical QoS) is no longer applicable in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.1 and later releases. The use of a single child policy map in multiple instances in the definition of a user-defined parent class is supported in these later releases.

---

### User-Defined Parent Class Limitation (for Conditional Policer)

On a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router with hierarchical QoS and user-defined parent classes applied, each child policy must use an unconditional policer (priority + policer). The use of conditional policers (priority x kbps) is not supported in these configurations in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.0. For more details, see CSCsy99583.

### Tunnel Protection+ Priority Queuing Limitation

On a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router configured with the tunnel protection command (which applies to DMVPN, VTI and GRE) and priority queuing (which applies to the outbound physical interface for the tunnel), it is not possible to oversubscribe the encryption coprocessor and maintain low latency traffic. A possible workaround is to apply both the crypto and priority qos policy to the physical interface. For more details, see CSCsy94190.

Starting with Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.1, the platform ipsec llq qos-group command resolves the preceding limitation. See the ["IPSec QoS Group-Based LLQ QoS" section](#wp3002081).

### Deny ACL Limitation for GET VPN

No more than 8 deny access control lists (ACLs) (a total of Key Server downloaded and group member local) are supported for Group Encrypted Transport VPN (GET VPN) in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.0. For more details, see CSCsy24144.

### Limitation on Use of Deny Statements in QoS Classification

Large numbers of deny statements should not be used as access control entries (ACEs) in access control lists (ACLs) used for Quality of Service (QoS) classification in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.0. The number of deny statements and the order of these statements with other permit statements in an ACL determines the amount of content-addressable memory (TCAM) used, and there is no fixed number quantified as a limit for this configuration. For more details, see CSCsx16234.

### Limitations and Restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.3

This section describes limitations and restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.3 and later releases.

### DMVPN Limitation

In a very large Dynamic Multipoint VPN (DMVPN) network (for example, 1500 spokes connecting to a single hub), some of the tunnels may not be fully reflected in the hardware and may cause traffic drop on those tunnels. This condition is more likely to happen when users configure a very large number of spokes and toggle the interfaces between shut and no shut multiple times. When this condition occurs, perform shut/no shut on the specific spoke for which the hub does not have the entry in the hardware.

### Scaling Limits for MLP

The supported scaling limits for Multilink PPP (MLP) per Cisco ASR 1000 Series chassis in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.3 and later releases are as follows:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)123 10 link bundles or

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)245 5 link bundles or

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)616 2 link bundles or

The maximum scaling limit for LFI is 1232 single link bundles.

If either the maximum number of bundles or maximum number of links are exceeded, the interface line rate may not be maintained. This limitation is especially applicable for configurations that have a high number of links per bundle and a high number of features enabled.

### Limitations and Restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1

This section describes limitations and restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1 and later releases.

### Cisco Firewall and WAAS Inter-Op Limitations and Restrictions

The Cisco Firewall and WAAS Interoperability feature is subject to the following limitations and restrictions for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Only Generic Routing Encapsulation (GRE) redirect and return is supported. Layer 2 redirect and return is not supported.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Certain platforms, such as the Cisco 2800 series, support an inbox network service module (WAAS-NM) that provides WAAS services. The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers do not support inbox network service modules; thus, the router will not support WAAS-NM.

### Control Plane Policing (CoPP) Limitations and Restrictions

Control Plane Policing (CoPP) does not support match protocol l2tp and match protocol dhcp for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1. CoPP does support packet matching with access lists, therefore you can police Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP) and Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) packets matched by access lists. For example, L2TP and DHCP packets can be matched with access lists that check User Datagram Protocol (UDP) packet port number (1701 for L2TP, 67 and 68 for DHCP).

### Flexible Packet Matching (FPM) Limitations and Restrictions

Flexible Packet Matching (FPM) support is subject to the following limitations and restrictions for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)[Table 13](#wp3005371) describes the functionality supported in the Raw FPM an d Basic FPM (Raw FPM+) modes in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1:

Table 13 FPM Functionality Support by Mode

| Mode | Supported Functionality |
| --- | --- |
| Raw FPM | •Supports Raw offset and bit pattern matching from L2 or L3 start  •Protocol unaware  •Match string pattern up to 32 bytes  •Regular expression matching  •Packet inspection depth: 256 bytes  •·Maximal 32 classes are supported in a policy-map; 8 entries per class map |
| Basic FPM (Raw FPM+) | •PHDF nomenclature (for fixed length fields)  •Support for building protocol stacks (for static header length only) |

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Although Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1 does not support the traffic classification description file (TCDF), bittorrent, iis-unicode, ios-http-vuln and skype can be configured manually.

### L2TP AAA Accounting Include NAS-PORT (VPI/VCI) Limitation

In Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1, the L2TP AAA Accounting Include NAS-PORT feature does not support the asynchronous transfer mode (ATM) virtual path identifier/virtual channel identifier (VPI/VCI) pair.

### Limitations and Restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.1

This section describes limitations and restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.1 and later releases.

### Maximum Number of Broadband Tunnels Limitation

Up to 16K broadband tunnels are supported in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.1.

### Maximum Number of IPSec Tunnels Limitation

Up to 4K IPSec tunnels are supported in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.1.

### Limitations and Restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.0

This section describes limitations and restrictions in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.0 and later releases.

### Conditional Policing Feature of QoS Limitation

The Conditional Policing feature of Quality of Service (QoS) is not supported in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.0

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.1 and later releases, the Conditional Policing feature of Quality of Service (QoS) is supported. This limitation does not apply to these later releases.

---

### IPSec Anti-Replay Window Size Limitation

The maximum IPSec anti-replay window size supported in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.0 is 512.

### Maximum Number of IPSec Tunnels Limitation

Up to 2k IPSec tunnels are supported in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.0.

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Beginning with Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.1 and later releases, up to 4K IPSec tunnels are supported supported. This 2K limitation does not apply to these later releases.

---

### NBAR Protocol Support Limitation

![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/note.gif)

---

**Note** ![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Later releases of NBAR in Cisco IOS XE include support for additional protocols. For information about the NBAR protocol support per Cisco IOS XE release, see the following document: [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/qos/configuration/guide/clsfy\_traffic\_nbar\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/qos/configuration/guide/clsfy_traffic_nbar_xe.html)

### Important Notes About IPSec Support on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router

This section contains important notes about IPSec support on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router:

IPSec CLI Support Notes

This section contains important notes about IPSec CLI support on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router:

For information on Cisco IOS IPSec commands, see the Cisco IOS Security Command Reference at: [http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/security/command/reference/sec\_s5.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/security/command/reference/sec_s5.html)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The show crypto engine command, which displays information about the crypto engine, is not currently supported on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router. The unsupported show crypto engine subcommands include the following:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)accelerator (Shows crypto accelerator information.)

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)brief (Shows all crypto engines in the system.)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not currently support the display of send and recv error statistics using the show crypto ipsec sa identity command.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not support the clear and show crypto commands on the standby Route Processor (RP) by design.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Counters in the show platform software ipsec fp active flow identifier n command are flagged for reset on read. You can use the show crypto ipsec sa command to obtain integral counters.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The show access-list command output does not show a packet count matching the ACL.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router displays debugging information about the consumption of IPsec datapath memory; use the show platform hardware qfp act feature ipsec datapath memory command in privileged EXEC or diagnostic mode.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router displays debugging information about the crypto engine processor registers; use the show platform software ipsec f0 encryption-processor registers command in privileged EXEC or diagnostic mode.

Crypto Map Support

This section contains important notes about IPSec crypto map support on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not currently support IPSec tunnel configuration for crypto maps with same IP address on both the tunnel interface and the physical interface. Configurations with different IP addresses are supported.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)A possible Embedded Services Processor (ESP) reload may occur if a large number (such as 2000) of crypto maps are removed simultaneously. When removing a large number of crypto maps, it is recommended you unconfigure 500 crypto maps at a time and wait 25 seconds between operations.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not support the show access-lists id command under crypto maps.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not currently support the interface range command when configuring crypto maps.

IPSec Packet Processing

This section contains important notes about IPSec packet processing on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Reloading an Embedded Services Processor (ESP) on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router may cause a few IPSec packets to drop before the initialization completes, but the traffic will resume after a brief interval.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router will not discard an incoming IP datagram containing a Payload Length other than 4 in the authentication header (AH). For example, a 96 bit authentication value plus the 3 32-bit word fixed portion for any non-null authentication algorithm will not be discarded.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not forward incoming authenticated packets with the IP option field set.

GET VPN Support

This section contains important notes about Group Encrypted Transport VPN (GET VPN) support on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)To ensure normal traffic flow for a GET VPN configuration on a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router, a Time Based Anti Replay (TBAR) window-size of greater than 42 seconds is recommended.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not currently support the TBAR statistics display in the show crypto gdoi gm replay command.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not currently support Easy VPN (EzVPN) and GET VPN on the same interface.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)When a Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router is to apply the same Group Domain of Interpretation (GDOI) crypto maps to two interfaces, you should use local addresses for the crypto maps. Non-local address configuration is not supported.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not currently support transport mode for TBAR.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router only supports the reassembly of post-fragmented GET VPN packets that are destined for the local Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router in the GET VPN network

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)An enhancement is added to enable reassembly of IPsec transit traffic. This enhancement applies only to post-encryption fragmented IPsec packets. When this enhancement is enabled, IPsec will detect transit IPsec traffic and reassemble it before decryption. GET VPN transit IPsec traffic will be reassembled, decrypted, and forwarded to the destination. Non GET VPN transit IPsec traffic will be reassembled but not decrypted (because the ASR 1000 router is not the IPsec tunnel end point) and then forwarded to the destination.

To enable IPsec reassembly of transit traffic, use the platform ipsec reassembly transit command in global configuration mode. To disable IPsec reassembly of transit traffic, use the no form of this command.

[no]platform ipsec reassembly transit

IPSec SSO and ISSU Support Notes

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router supports stateful IPSec sessions on ESP switchover. During ESP switchover, all IPSec sessions will stay up and no user intervention is needed to maintain IPSec sessions.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For an ESP reload (no standby ESP), the SA sequence number restarts from 0. The peer router drops packets that do not have the expected sequence number. User may need to explicitly reestablish IPSec sessions to work around this issue for systems that have a single ESP after an ESP reload. User may experience traffic disruption over the IPSec sessions in such cases for the duration of the reload.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router currently does not support Stateful Switchover (SSO) IPSec sessions on Route Processors (RPs). The IPSec sessions will go down on initiation of the switchover, but will come back up when the new RP becomes active. No user intervention is needed. User will experience traffic disruption over the IPSec sessions for the duration of the switchover, until the sessions are back up.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router currently does not support stateful ISSU for IPSec sessions. Before performing an ISSU, users must explicitly terminate all existing IPSec sessions or tunnels prior to the operation and reestablish them post ISSU. Specifically, users must ensure that there are no half-open or established IPSec tunnels present before performing ISSU. To do this, we recommend user do a interface shutdown in the case of interfaces that may initiate a tunnel setup, such as a routing protocol initiating a tunnel setup, or interfaces that have keepalive enabled or where there is an auto trigger for an IPSec session. Traffic disruption over the IPSec sessions during ISSU is obvious in this case.

Summarizing and restating the different caveats:

ESP - switchover (with standby ESP) : Stateful :

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)IPSec sessions should be up. No user intervention needed.

ESP - Reload (No standby ESP) : Stateless :

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)IPSec sessions will go down and come back up. Usually no user intervention is needed. However, user may need to explicitly reestablish Ipsec session again if anti replay is configured (sequence number checking).

RP - switchover (with standby RP) : Stateless :

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)IPSec sessions will go down on RP switchover and should reestablish themselves when the new RP gains active role. No user intervention is needed.

ISSU (irrespective of chassis type): Stateless :

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)User must explicitly terminate all IPSec sessions by shutting the interfaces, perform ISSU and then reestablish tunnels by enabling the interfaces. No other intervention needed.

Miscellaneous IPSec Support Notes

This section contains miscellaneous important notes about IPSec support on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The security association (SA) maximum transmission unit (MTU) calculation is based on the interface MTU instead of the IP MTU.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router currently supports a maximum anti-replay window value of 512. If you attempt to configure a value larger than 512, the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router defaults back to 512 internally (although the display still shows your user-configured value).

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not currently support nested SA transformation such as:

```
crypto ipsec transform-set transform-1 ah-sha-hmac esp-3des esp-md5-hmac

```

```
crypto ipsec transform-set transform-1 ah-md5-hmac esp-3des esp-md5-hmac

```

```

```

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not currently support Cisco IOS Certificate Authority (CA) server features.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not currently support COMP-LZS configuration.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)For the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router, when configuring GRE over IPSec, user is recommended to use only Tunnel protection mode on the Tunnel interface. Using crypto maps on both tunnel and physical interface to achieve GRE over IPSec is not the supported method of configuration.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router does not currently support VRF-Aware IPSec.

### NAT and Firewall ALG Support on Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers

The NAT and Firewall ALG Support on Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers matrix summarizes Network Address Translation (NAT) and Firewall Application Layer Gateway (ALG) feature support on Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers in Cisco IOS XE  Release 2.1.0 and later releases. The matrix lists feature support by release. NAT and Firewall ALG support is cumulative; features introduced in earlier releases continue to be supported in later releases. You can find the matrix at

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/technical\_references/asr1000alg\_support.pdf](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/routers/asr1000/technical_references/asr1000alg_support.pdf)

### Important Notes in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6.0:

This section describes important issues that you should be aware of for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6.0 and later releases.

### Per-User Attribute On PPP Virtual Access

In Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6.0 multiple instances of the per-user attribute `Cisco-Avpair=lcp:interface-config=<*cmd*>' is not supported.

For example:

Cisco-AVPair = lcp:interface-config=ip vrf forwarding vpngreen

Cisco-AVPair= lcp:interface-config=ip unnumbered loopback2

Should be configured like this in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6.0:

Cisco-AVPair = lcp:interface-config=ip vrf forwarding vpngreen \nip unnumbered loopback2

"Multiple instances will be supported in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6.1"

### Legacy QoS Command Deprecation: Hidden Commands

To streamline Cisco IOS QoS (quality of service), certain commands are being hidden. Although these commands are available in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.6, the CLI interactive help does not display them. If

you attempt to view a command by entering a question mark at the command line, the command does not appear. However, if you know the command syntax, you can enter it. The system will accept the command and return a message explaining that it will soon be removed. These commands will be completely removed in a future release, which means that you will need to use the appropriate replacement commands.

For more information, see the following document:

[http://www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios\_xe/qos/configuration/guide/legacy\_qos\_cli\_deprecation\_xe.html](//www.cisco.com/en/US/docs/ios/ios_xe/qos/configuration/guide/legacy_qos_cli_deprecation_xe.html)

### VRF-Aware NAT

Dependency of NAT on VFR

ASRNAT will not handle fragmented packets unless VFR is configured on all NAT interfaces. VFR will automatically be configured when NAT is configured, but users must "not" manually unconfigure VFR on NAT interfaces as NAT cannot process the fragmented packets and out-of-order fragments correctly.

### Important Notes in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.5.0:

This section describes important issues that you should be aware of for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.5.0 and later releases.

### Embedded Packet Capture

The Embedded Packet Capture (EPC) feature is not functional and not supported for the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers.

### QoS - Policing Support for GRE Tunnels

When queuing feature on the GRE tunnel interface is not supported with crypto configured on the physical interface.

### QoS: QoS support for GRE/sVTI Tunnel

With IOS XE 2.5.0, the Cisco ASR 1000 Router Series supports Quality-of Service (QoS) applied to

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)A GRE or sVTI tunnel with policing and marking only for INGRESS traffic

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)A GRE or sVTI tunnel with 2-level hierarchy allowing queuing on the second level for EGRESS traffic

When there are multiple egress physical interfaces for a tunnel, and the tunnel target physical interface changes as a result of tunnel target destination route change, either manually by user configuration or by routing protocol, IOS will not prevent the tunnel traffic from moving to an alternate egress physical interface.

However, in IOS XE 2.5.0, QoS tunnel move feature is not supported. When tunnel traffic moved to an alternate egress physical interface, tunnel QoS policy may enter a suspended state. At this point, the tunnel QoS policy will have to be removed and reapplied to the tunnel interface for it to take effect.

In addition, queuing features on the GRE tunnel interface are not supported when IPSec is configured on the physical interface.

In a GRE over IPsec configuration with a crypto map configured on the physical interface, traffic shaping on the GRE tunnel interface is not supported. The workaround is to use sVTI (tunnel protection with tunnel mode IPsec).

### VRF-Aware NAT

Integrating NAT with MPLS VPNs

Prerequisites for integrating NAT with MPLS VPNs

Before performing the tasks in this module, you should be familiar with the concepts described in the "Configuring NAT for IP Address Conservation" module.

All access lists required for use with the tasks in this module should be configured prior to beginning the configuration task. For information about how to configure an access list, see the "IP Access List Sequence Numbering" document at the following URL:

[http://www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios122s/122snwft/release/122s14/fsacl](//www.cisco.com/univercd/cc/td/doc/product/software/ios122s/122snwft/release/122s14/fsaclseq.htm)

Restrictions for Integrating NAT with MPLS VPNs

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)The following functionality is not supported for VRF-Aware NAT:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)VPN to VPN translations. In other words, VRF cannot be applied on the NAT outside interface.

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Translation of multicast packets

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Translations with inside destinations

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Reversible route maps

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)MIBs

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)MPLS traffic engineering

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configuring inside dynamic translations defined with outside interface mappings is not supported.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Configuring inside static translations with interface mappings is not supported. The following commands, which do not include VRF, are not supported:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ip nat inside source static e**sp** *local-ip* interface *type number*

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ip nat inside source static *local-ip global-ip* route-map name

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ip nat inside source static udp *local-ip* *local-port* interface *type number* global-port

Dependency of NAT on VFR

ASRNAT will not handle fragmented packets unless VFR is configured on all NAT interfaces. VFR will automatically be configured when NAT is configured, but users must "not" manually unconfigure VFR on NAT interfaces as NAT cannot process the fragmented packets and out-of-order fragments correctly.

### Important Notes in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.2t:

This section describes important issues that you should be aware of for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.4.2t. Due to the Certification Authorities requirements access to the platform shell in this FIPS 140-2 certified version of IOS XE is disabled by invalidating the "platform shell" CLI command:

```
mcp-4ru-28(config)#platform ?

```

```
  ipsec      Platform specific ipsec command

```

```
  multicast  Configure multicast

```

```
  reload     Platform specific reload command

```

```
  shell      Control platform shell access command availability

```

```

### Important Notes in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.0

This section describes important issues that you should be aware of for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.0 and later releases.

### Any Transport Over MPLS (AToM) Support

The configuration of Any Transport Over MPLS (AToM) on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.3.0 is only supported on a subinterface; AToM cannot be configured on the main interface. In addition, you cannot have any IP configuration on the main interface when you have an AToM configuration on the subinterface. These configuration guidelines are applicable to VC mode, VP mode, and L2VPN PW redundancy.

### MPLS TE Support

Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router users considering the implementation of MPLS TE are recommended to consult with their local Cisco technical support representative for Cisco IOS XE implementation details.

### VRF-Aware NAT

Dependency of NAT on VFR

ASRNAT will not handle fragmented packets unless VFR is configured on all NAT interfaces. VFR will automatically be configured when NAT is configured, but users must "not" manually unconfigure VFR on NAT interfaces as NAT cannot process the fragmented packets and out-of-order fragments correctly.

### Important Notes in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.2

This section describes important issues that you should be aware of for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.2 and later releases.

### SSO for L2TP Tunnel Switching Not Supported

### VRF-Aware NAT

Dependency of NAT on VFR

ASRNAT will not handle fragmented packets unless VFR is configured on all NAT interfaces and environments in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.2. VFR will automatically be configured when NAT is configured, but users must "not" manually unconfigure VFR on NAT interfaces as NAT cannot process the fragmented packets and out-of-order fragments correctly.

### Important Notes in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1

This section describes important issues that you should be aware of for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1 and later releases.

### 100M FX SFP Not Supported on Cisco 2-Port Gigabit Ethernet Shared Port Adapter

The 100M FX SFP is not supported on the Cisco 2-Port Gigabit Ethernet Shared Port Adapter (2x1GE SPA) on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1.

### Intelligent Service Gateway (ISG) Features Not Supported

The following Intelligent Service Gateway (ISG) features are not supported on the Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1:

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ISG IP subscriber functionality on the following types of access interfaces: Gigabit EtherChannel (GEC) (Port Channel), generic routing encapsulation (GRE), PPP (virtual-template), and Layer 2 Tunneling Protocol (L2TP)

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)ISG IP interface sessions

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Interface statistics for ISG multiservice interfaces

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Access lists cannot be configured as match criteria in ISG Layer 4 redirect configuration. As an alternative, Layer 4 redirect should be configured in ISG traffic class services.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Stateful Switchover (SSO and in-service software upgrade (ISSU) for ISG IP subscriber sessions or traffic class sessions. Upon switchover, an IP session must be recreated or restarted (for Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) sessions) when the session becomes active again.

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)SSO and ISSU for any features on IP subscriber sessions or traffic class sessions

•![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)SSO and ISSU for the following features on ISG PPP sessions:

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Port-Bundle Host Key

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Layer 4 Redirect

–![](/c/dam/en/us/td/i/templates/blank.gif)Traffic Class

### Per-Session Multicast Support

Enhancements to the IP multicast feature provide support for per-session multicast in broadband environments in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1.

### VRF-Aware NAT

Dependency of NAT on VFR

ASRNAT will not handle fragmented packets unless VFR is configured on all NAT interfaces and environments in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.2.1. VFR will automatically be configured when NAT is configured, but users must "not" manually unconfigure VFR on NAT interfaces as NAT cannot process the fragmented packets and out-of-order fragments correctly.

### Important Notes in Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.1

This section describes important issues that you should be aware of for Cisco IOS XE Release 2.1.1 and later releases.

### Startup Configuration File Backup

As a matter of routine maintenance on any Cisco router, users should backup the startup configuration file by copying the startup configuration file from NVRAM onto one of the router's other file systems and, additionally, onto a network server. Backing up the startup configuration file provides an easy method of recovering the startup configuration file in the event the startup configuration file in NVRAM becomes unusable for any reason.

For users using any Cisco ASR 1000 Series Router with a single RP, including any Cisco ASR 1002 or Cisco ASR 1004 Router, backing up the startup configuration file onto another router file system is especially important due to CSCsq70140, which is documented in the Caveats section of these release notes. The workaround for users who run into this caveat is to replace the startup configuration file in NVRAM with a backup copy of the startup configuration file on the router; therefore, customers who have backed up their startup configuration files onto the router will be ready to resolve these caveats if they occur on their Cisco ASR 1000 Series Routers using a single RP.

Example 1: Copying Startup Configuration File to Bootflash

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

# Common Vulnerability Scoring System

| Choose the version of CVSS calculator:   Version 1  Version 2  Version 3  Version 3.1 |
| --- |
| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 7.8 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 7.8 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 7.8 |
