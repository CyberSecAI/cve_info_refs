Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32654:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Nextcloud handles Federated File Sharing. It allows an attacker to gain write/read privileges on any Federated File Share. Because public links can be added as federated file shares, these are also vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper access control in Federated File Sharing.
- Public links can be exploited through their addition as federated file shares.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain read and write privileges on any federated file share.
- This includes the ability to:
    - Add malicious data to folders.
    - Gain read access to "Files Drop" links.
    - Potentially compromise files shared via public links.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By exploiting the federation capabilities of Nextcloud.
- Specifically by targeting federated file shares and public links added as such shares.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to interact with the Nextcloud instance's Federated File Sharing functionality.
- The attacker does not seem to need prior access to any account on the Nextcloud instance.
- The attacker can act remotely by leveraging public links or federated shares.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity.
- The affected versions include Nextcloud Server versions less than 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2.
- The vulnerability is tracked under CWE-639 (Authorization Bypass Through User-Controlled Key).
- The identified patch is to upgrade Nextcloud to versions 19.0.11, 20.0.10, or 21.0.2
- A workaround was to disable Federated File Sharing.
