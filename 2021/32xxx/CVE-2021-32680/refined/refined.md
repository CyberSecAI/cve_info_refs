Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32680

**Description:** The audit logging functionality in Nextcloud Server did not properly log events when a share's expiration date was unset.

**Root Cause:** The application failed to generate the correct log entry when a user removed the expiration date from a share.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
* **Improper Audit Logging:** The core issue is the lack of proper logging when a specific event (unsetting a share expiration date) occurs. This falls under CWE-778 (Insufficient Logging).

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* **Lack of Visibility:** The primary impact is a lack of visibility into user actions. Administrators would not be aware when users remove expiration dates on shares, which is supposed to be logged.
* **Compromised Audit Trails:** This could impact compliance and security auditing since it can prevent proper activity monitoring.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **User action**: A legitimate user with the right privileges unsets the expiration date of a share.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   A user with the permission to modify share settings. No special attacker position is needed since this affects normal application use.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for this vulnerability was implemented in Nextcloud versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3.
*   The vulnerability was reported through HackerOne.
*   A pull request ([https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/27024](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/27024)) addresses the issue.
