This fix prevents hiredis from trying to allocate more than `SIZE_MAX`
bytes, which would result in a buffer overrun.

Hello, this patch surprises me a little:

* Normally applications assume `calloc()` is reasonable and performs the overflow check itself. I'd argue any implementation of `calloc()` that neglects this check deserves a CVE so that it can be fixed, once, for all applications using that implementation, and applications can skip doing these checks themselves.
* If Redis must work on platforms with a broken `calloc()` that cannot be fixed, why not put this check into the `hi_calloc()` wrapper function? This would save the Redis developers from needing to annotate every call site with this check.

Thanks

Sorry, something went wrong.

Hi,

* We agree that any sane `calloc` will perform this check itself, but we received a formal report from MSVR who recommended the hardening.
* Good point, I think the wrapper function is a better place for the logic. I'll make a point to do that before the next release.

Edit: cc [@setharnold](https://github.com/setharnold) [Branch with refactored logic for reference](https://github.com/redis/hiredis/pull/new/minor-overflow-check-refactor)

# hiredis, hiredis-py: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202210-32**

An integer overflow has been found in hiredis which could result in arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **dev-libs/hiredis** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **1.0.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **1.0.1** |

| Package | **dev-python/hiredis** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.0** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.0** |

### Background

hiredis is a minimalistic C client library for the Redis database.
hiredis-py is a Python extension that wraps hiredis.

### Description

Hiredis is vulnerable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data. When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count \* sizeof(redisReply\*)` can be represented in `SIZE\_MAX`. If it can not, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.

### Impact

Malicious Redis commands could result in remote code execution.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All hiredis users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-libs/hiredis-1.0.1"

```

All hiredis-py users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=dev-python/hiredis-2.0.0"

```

# Integer Overflow to Buffer Overflow in hiredis

High

[michael-grunder](/michael-grunder)
published
GHSA-hfm9-39pp-55p2
Oct 4, 2021

## Package

hiredis

## Affected versions

All Versions

## Patched versions

TBD

## Description

### Impact

Hiredis is vulnurable to integer overflow if provided maliciously crafted or corrupted `RESP` `mult-bulk` protocol data.

When parsing `multi-bulk` (array-like) replies, hiredis fails to check if `count * sizeof(redisReply*)` can be represented in `SIZE_MAX`. If it can not, and the `calloc()` call doesn't itself make this check, it would result in a short allocation and subsequent buffer overflow.

[A more thorough explanation of the vulnerability](https://wiki.sei.cmu.edu/confluence/display/c/MEM07-C.%2BEnsure%2Bthat%2Bthe%2Barguments%2Bto%2Bcalloc%28%29%2C%2Bwhen%2Bmultiplied%2C%2Bdo%2Bnot%2Bwrap)

### Patches

The problem has been patched in the private fork and will be released in `v1.0.1`

### Workarounds

Users of hiredis >= `1.0.0` may set the [maxelements](https://github.com/redis/hiredis#reader-max-array-elements) context option to a value small enough that no overflow is possible.

A system-independent implementation of that calculation might look like so:

```
/* The extra division by 2 is because `MAP` and `HASH` replies send the number of
   key/value pairs. */
context->maxelements = SIZE_MAX / sizeof(redisReply*) / 2;
```

This will require a recompilation of their code, however.

Also worth noting that the value defaults to `4,294,967,295`, so users of `>= v1.0.0` in 64-bit environments are likely unaffected by default.

# [MEM07-C. Ensure that the arguments to calloc(), when multiplied, do not wrap](/confluence/display/c/MEM07-C.%2BEnsure%2Bthat%2Bthe%2Barguments%2Bto%2Bcalloc%28%29%2C%2Bwhen%2Bmultiplied%2C%2Bdo%2Bnot%2Bwrap)

* Created by  [Jeffrey Gennari](/confluence/display/~jsg), last modified by  [Anirban Gangopadhyay](/confluence/display/~anirban.gangopadhyay) on [Sep 03, 2019](/confluence/pages/diffpagesbyversion.action?pageId=87152094&selectedPageVersions=97&selectedPageVersions=98 "Show changes")

The `calloc()` function takes two arguments: the number of elements to allocate and the storage size of those elements. Typically, `calloc()` [implementations](/confluence/display/c/BB.%2BDefinitions#BB.Definitions-implementations) multiply these arguments to determine how much memory to allocate. Historically, some implementations failed to check whether out-of-bounds results silently wrapped [[RUS-CERT Advisory 2002-08:02](http://cert.uni-stuttgart.de/advisories/calloc.php)]. If the result of multiplying the number of elements to allocate and the storage size wraps, less memory is allocated than was requested. As a result, it is necessary to ensure that these arguments, when multiplied, do not wrap.

Modern implementations of the C standard library should check for wrap. If the `calloc()` function implemented by the libraries used for a particular implementation properly handles [unsigned integer wrapping](/confluence/display/c/BB.%2BDefinitions#BB.Definitions-unsignedintegerwrapping) (in conformance with [INT30-C. Ensure that unsigned integer operations do not wrap](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/INT30-C.%2BEnsure%2Bthat%2Bunsigned%2Binteger%2Boperations%2Bdo%2Bnot%2Bwrap)) when multiplying the number of elements to allocate and the storage size, that is sufficient to comply with this recommendation and no further action is required.

## Noncompliant Code Example

In this noncompliant example, the user-defined function `get_size()` (not shown) is used to calculate the size requirements for a dynamic array of `long int` that is assigned to the variable `num_elements`. When `calloc()` is called to allocate the buffer, `num_elements` is multiplied by `sizeof(long)` to compute the overall size requirements. If the number of elements multiplied by the size cannot be represented as a `size_t`, then `calloc()` may allocate a buffer of insufficient size. When data is copied to that buffer, an overflow may occur.

```
size_t num_elements;

long *buffer = (long *)calloc(num_elements, sizeof(long));
if (buffer == NULL) {
  /* Handle error condition */
}
/* ... */
free(buffer);
buffer = NULL;

```
## Compliant Solution

In this compliant solution, the two arguments `num_elements` and `sizeof(long)` are checked before the call to `calloc()` to determine if wrapping will occur:

```
long *buffer;
size_t num_elements;

if (num_elements > SIZE_MAX/sizeof(long)) {
  /* Handle error condition */
}
buffer = (long *)calloc(num_elements, sizeof(long));
if (buffer == NULL) {
  /* Handle error condition */
}

```

Note that the maximum amount of allocatable memory is typically limited to a value less than `SIZE_MAX` (the maximum value of `size_t`). Always check the return value from a call to any memory allocation function in compliance with [ERR33-C. Detect and handle standard library errors](/confluence/display/c/ERR33-C.%2BDetect%2Band%2Bhandle%2Bstandard%2Blibrary%2Berrors).

## Risk Assessment

Unsigned integer wrapping in memory allocation functions can lead to buffer overflows that can be [exploited](/confluence/display/c/BB.%2BDefinitions#BB.Definitions-exploit) by an attacker to execute arbitrary code with the permissions of the vulnerable process. Most implementations of `calloc()` now check to make sure silent wrapping does not occur, but it is not always safe to assume the version of `calloc()` being used is secure, particularly when using dynamically linked libraries.

   Is there an entry on this site regarding the similar overflow in the C++ new[] operator?  I looked but couldn't find one.  By the way, gcc still does not check if new[] overflows.

   <http://gcc.gnu.org/bugzilla/show_bug.cgi?id=19351>

   Microsoft's compiler does.

   For the automatic detection, do we really expect everyone to have a size check before every call to `calloc()` even though it is only necessary on non C99 compliant systems? Seems like we'll be flagging a lot of code that no one will want to change....

      I believe so, according to the letter of this rec. Probably this is a rec, not a rule, because following it strictly is probably unreasonable.

      We can add exceptions to this rule to mitigate its 'unreasonability'. For instance, one could forego the check if the product is known at compile time.

         This guideline became alot more reasonable with the inclusion of the "don't need to check if the library checks" clause.

         Now I'm wondering if this shouldn't be promoted back to a rule?

            It prob is worth promoting (although we should prob clarify which standards require an explicit multiplciation check.)

            This rule may be another in the set of 'rules for older C platforms, but not C11 (what about C99?)'. AFAIK EXP35-C is the only other rule in that set.

               I don't think the langauge in the standard ever changed. I think this is just a matter of common implementation practice, which changed after the vulnerbility was publicized.

   Is it worthwhile for this rule to also handle multiplications inside malloc() or realloc()?

   eg

   ```
     foo_t* foo = (foo_t*) malloc(sizeof(foo_t) * number);

   ```

      This is not necessary, as it is covered by [INT30-C. Ensure that unsigned integer operations do not wrap](https://www.securecoding.cert.org/confluence/display/seccode/INT30-C.%2BEnsure%2Bthat%2Bunsigned%2Binteger%2Boperations%2Bdo%2Bnot%2Bwrap).  This rule is here because the offense occurs "off stage", in a standard library function.

   > If the libraries used for a particular implementation properly handle unsigned integer wrapping on the multiplication, that is sufficient to comply with this recommendation.

   Can we rewrite this to the following?

     "If the libraries ensure that all the code doing multiplication (including the code implementing calloc())  properly handle unsigned integer wrapping, that is sufficient to comply with this recommendation."

   I think it means the library is compliant to "INT30-C. Ensure that unsigned integer operations do not wrap", hence an alternative phrase is

     " If the library is compliant to INT30-C, then it means that integer wrapping does not happen inside calloc(). In this case, the library is compliant to this recommendation."

      I made a change which may not have been exactly what you were asking for, but which might clarify further.  In the narrow sense of this rule, it is only necessary for the a library to add one check for unsigned wrapping when multiplying the arguments provided to the calloc() function.  If this check has been added, the application programmer can ignore this recommendation safely (even if wrap around checks elsewhere in the library have not been inserted).
