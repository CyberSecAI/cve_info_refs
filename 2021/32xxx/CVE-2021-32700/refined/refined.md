Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32700:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the Ballerina CLI's use of HTTP instead of HTTPS when retrieving packages from the Ballerina Central (BC) repository. This insecure communication channel allows for a Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM) attack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insecure communication:** The primary weakness is the use of HTTP for package retrieval, which does not provide encryption or integrity checks. This makes the connection vulnerable to eavesdropping and tampering.
- **Lack of integrity verification:** The Ballerina CLI, in the vulnerable versions, doesn't verify the integrity of the packages downloaded from BC. This allows an attacker to substitute or modify packages without detection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Supply chain attack:** An attacker performing a MiTM attack can replace legitimate Ballerina packages with malicious ones.
- **Malware injection:** By substituting packages, an attacker can inject malicious code into Ballerina executables built by users.
- **Compromise of user systems:** Executables containing the injected malicious code could lead to the compromise of user systems when run.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MiTM):** An attacker needs to position themselves between the user and the Ballerina Central repository to intercept and modify the network traffic. This can be done on a local network, or by compromising network infrastructure.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network proximity:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic between the user's machine and the Ballerina Central repository. This could involve being on the same network as the user or having compromised network equipment.
- **Traffic interception:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify the HTTP requests and responses.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided code diffs show that the fix involves changing `HttpURLConnection` to `HttpsURLConnection` in the `Pull.java`, `Push.java`, `Search.java` and `Utils.java` files, enforcing the use of HTTPS for secure communication.
- The advisory explicitly mentions that the `ballerina pull, build, run commands` are affected.
- The advisory lists the affected versions as `< 1.2.14` and `< SL-alpha4` and patched versions as `1.2.14` and `SL-alpha4`.
- The vulnerability is rated as High severity.
- No specific CWE is associated with this vulnerability but it's related to insecure network communication.
