Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32779:

**Root Cause:**

*   Envoy incorrectly handles URI fragments (`#fragment`) as part of the path element. Specifically, when a URI like `/app1/admin#foo` is received, Envoy may treat `#foo` as a suffix of the path, leading to incorrect path matching.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Improper Handling of URI Fragments:**  Envoy fails to properly separate the fragment from the path component of a URI.
*   **Path Normalization Issues:** Depending on the Envoy version and configuration (`path_normalization`), the fragment is either treated as part of the path or percent-encoded, which can also cause issues with path-based authorization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Escalation of Privileges:** When path-based request authorization is used (e.g., using an RBAC filter), the incorrect path interpretation allows attackers to bypass authorization rules and potentially access restricted resources. For example, if an RBAC filter is configured to explicitly allow access to `/admin` but denies access to `/admin#foo`, the vulnerability allows an attacker to access the `/admin` resource using the path `/admin#foo`.
*   **Violation of RFC3986:** The resulting URI with the appended fragment, sent to the next server-agent, violates RFC3986.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted URI:** The vulnerability is triggered by a specially constructed HTTP request from an untrusted client that includes a URI with a fragment (e.g., `/app1/admin#foo`).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Untrusted Client:** The attacker needs to be able to send arbitrary HTTP requests to the Envoy proxy.
*   **Knowledge of target system:** The attacker needs to know that path-based request authorization extensions are used, for example with an explicit case of a final "/admin" path element, or is using a negative assertion with final path element of "/admin" and needs to know the route they are trying to bypass

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Envoy versions prior to 1.19.1, 1.18.4, 1.17.4, and 1.16.5.
*   The fix involves removing the fragment from the URI path in incoming requests, which was implemented in the patched versions.
*   The provided CVSS score is 8.6 (High) with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N. This implies the vulnerability is remotely exploitable with low attack complexity, and no privileges or user interaction is required to exploit it. The scope is changed and the impact is high for confidentiality.
