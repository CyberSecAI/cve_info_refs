Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a type confusion issue in the `striptags` library. The function didn't properly validate the type of its `html` input parameter. When an array-like object (instead of a string) was passed as the `html` argument, the function would attempt to concatenate it, leading to unsanitized output.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Type Confusion:** The primary weakness is the lack of input validation for the `html` parameter, leading to type confusion when it's not a string.
- **Unsanitized Output:** Passing a non-string allows attacker-controlled input to bypass sanitization, which is the core purpose of the library.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The vulnerability enables an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to XSS attacks. If an attacker controls the input to the `striptags` function, they can insert malicious code which will then be executed in the context of the user's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Controlled Input:** The attack vector relies on an attacker's ability to control the input passed as the `html` argument to the `striptags` function.
- **Query Parameters:** A specific example given is passing query parameters directly into the function, which an attacker may be able to control.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Control over Input:** The attacker must be able to influence or fully control the `html` argument. This might be possible if:
    -  User input is directly passed to the function
    -  Data from an external source that an attacker can manipulate is used.

**Additional Notes:**

- The fix involves adding a type check to the `striptags` function, explicitly throwing a `TypeError` if the `html` argument is not a string.
- The vulnerability is present in versions prior to `3.2.0`, and it is patched in `3.2.0`.
- The library does not use regular expressions for stripping tags.
- The provided information explicitly mentions that the vulnerability is a type confusion issue and can lead to XSS.
- The provided content includes the commit that fixed this vulnerability with changes to `package.json`, `src/striptags.js` and `test/striptags-test.js`.
