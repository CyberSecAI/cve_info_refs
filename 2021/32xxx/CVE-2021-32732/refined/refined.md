Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32732:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The "Forgot Username" form in XWiki was vulnerable due to two primary issues:

1.  **Information Disclosure:** The form would reveal whether a user account existed for a given email address by providing different responses for valid and invalid email addresses. It also displayed the actual username in the response, thus leaking valid usernames.
2.  **Lack of CSRF Protection:** The form lacked Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection, making it easy for an attacker to send a large number of requests to the "Forgot Username" page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-202 (Information Exposure):** The system was disclosing sensitive information about the existence of user accounts and usernames based on user input (email address).
*  **CWE-352 (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The lack of CSRF protection allowed an attacker to send forged requests without the user's consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **User Enumeration:** Attackers could enumerate valid user accounts by sending requests with different email addresses and observing the system's responses.
*   **Username Disclosure:** Attackers could directly obtain usernames associated with valid email addresses.
*   **Potential for Abuse:** The combination of user enumeration and CSRF vulnerability could potentially be used in further attacks if this information can be combined with other vulnerabilities.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability was exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **HTTP Request Forgery**: An attacker could craft malicious requests to the vulnerable "Forgot Username" endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No privileges required:**  An attacker does not need to have any pre-existing access to the system.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack does not require any interaction from legitimate users other than them having an account on the system.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable XWiki instance.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed by implementing CSRF protection and changing the "Forgot Username" process to always send an email to the specified address and only include user names in the email.
* The fix also introduced a generic success message even if the email provided does not have a user associated, avoiding the user enumeration issue.
* The vulnerability was present in XWiki versions prior to 12.10.5, 13.0, and 13.1.
* Patched versions are 12.10.5 and 13.2RC1.
