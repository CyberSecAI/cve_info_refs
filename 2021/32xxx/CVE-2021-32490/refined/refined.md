Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32490:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write in the `DJVU::filter_bv()` function within the djvulibre library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Out-of-bounds write:** The `DJVU::filter_bv()` function attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory region when processing a crafted djvu file, leading to a memory corruption.
*   The root cause was an unchecked size variable (`sz`). If `sz` was 0, memory would not be allocated (`data16` would remain uninitialized) but later writes to it would occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Crash:** The primary impact is a crash of applications using the djvulibre library to handle DjVu files, due to memory access violation.
*  **Other consequences:** The vulnerability has the potential for other consequences besides just a crash due to the out-of-bounds write. While not explicitly detailed, arbitrary code execution is mentioned as a possibility in the provided data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted DjVu File:** The vulnerability is triggered by opening or processing a specially crafted DjVu file using an application linked against a vulnerable version of the djvulibre library.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted djvu file to a user who processes it with an application using the vulnerable djvulibre library.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by 1vanChen of NSFOCUS Security Team and reported on 2021-03-26.
*   The vulnerability is present in djvulibre version 3.5.28 and earlier.
*   A patch was created that checks if the image size is 0 before allocating memory, preventing the crash.
*   The issue has been fixed in Fedora 32 and later.
*   Debian has addressed this issue in version 3.5.27.1-10+deb10u1 (for buster) and version 3.5.28-2 (for bullseye).
