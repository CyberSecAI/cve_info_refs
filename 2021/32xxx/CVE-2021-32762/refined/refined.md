  "CVE-2021-32762": {
    "description": "The redis-cli command line tool and redis-sentinel service may be vulnerable to integer overflow when parsing specially crafted large multi-bulk network replies. This is a result of a vulnerability in the underlying hiredis library which does not perform an overflow check before calling the calloc() heap allocation function.",
    "root_cause": "Integer overflow in hiredis library when parsing multi-bulk replies, leading to insufficient memory allocation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow",
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of service or arbitrary code execution due to heap buffer overflow.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Specially crafted multi-bulk network replies"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "Attacker needs to send specially crafted RESP replies to the vulnerable redis-cli or redis-sentinel, low privileges are required"
