# End-to-end encryption device setup did not verify public key

Moderate

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-f5fr-5gcv-6cc5
Aug 18, 2021

## Package

Desktop Client
(Nextcloud)

## Affected versions

< 3.3.0

## Patched versions

3.3.0

## Description

### Impact

Clients using the Nextcloud end-to-end encryption feature download the public and private key via an API endpoint as described in the [RFC](https://github.com/nextcloud/end_to_end_encryption_rfc/blob/7f002996397faefb664019a97ebb0a1e210f64f0/RFC.md#further-devices):

> In case a certificate exists already for the user the client has to download the existing private key. This is done the following way:
>
> 1. Client downloads private key from the /ocs/v2.php/apps/end\_to\_end\_encryption/api/v1/private-key endpoint.
> 2. Client asks the user for the mnemonic and decrypts the private key using AES/GCM/NoPadding as cipher (256 bit key size) and PBKDF2WithHmacSHA1 as key derivation.
> 3. Client checks if private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate.
> 4. Client checks if their certificate was signed by the server (checking the servers public key from /ocs/v2.php/apps/end\_to\_end\_encryption/api/v1/server-key)
> 5. Client stores the private key in the keychain of the device.
> 6. The mnemonic is stored in the keychain of the device (ideally with spaces so it can be shown more readable).

The Nextcloud Desktop client skipped the third step: "Client checks if private key belongs to previously downloaded public certificate." - If the Nextcloud instance served a malicious public key, the data would be encrypted for this key and thus could be accessible to a malicious actor.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Desktop client is upgraded to 3.3.0.

### Workarounds

None.
