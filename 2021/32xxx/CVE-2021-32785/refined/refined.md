Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32785:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content from `security.netapp.com` directly mentions `CVE-2021-32785` as an Apache HTTP Server vulnerability.
*   The content from `lists.debian.org` lists `CVE-2021-32785` as a vulnerability in `libapache2-mod-auth-openidc` and describes it as a "Crash when using an unencrypted Redis cache.".
*   The content from `github.com` describes `CVE-2021-32785` and its associated fix in `mod_auth_openidc` as well.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an uncontrolled format string bug in the `mod_auth_openidc` module when configured to use an unencrypted Redis cache. The module was incorrectly performing argument interpolation on the cache key before passing it to Redis, which led to a crash when a crafted key was used.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Format String Vulnerability:** The primary weakness is the format string vulnerability in the Redis cache interaction within the `mod_auth_openidc` module.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could exploit this vulnerability to cause repeated crashes of Apache workers, resulting in a denial-of-service condition. This was due to the crash when a crafted key was passed to redis.
*   While the `github.com` content suggests that arbitrary code execution does not appear to be possible, the repeated crashes could disrupt service availability.
*   The `security.netapp.com` content also indicates a possibility of "disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data or Denial of Service (DoS)". However, this description is general, and the content from github and debian provides more specific details for this CVE.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is network-accessible, as it can be triggered by sending crafted data to the server.
*   The attacker can trigger the vulnerability by sending a crafted key that gets used in the redis command.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not require any user privileges.
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server with a malicious key that will be used in the vulnerable redis command.
*   The attacker requires knowledge of how the `mod_auth_openidc` module constructs the Redis key, as an attacker needs to send crafted data that will be used as a cache key.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The `github.com` content also describes a fix that prevents the format string vulnerability by using the `redisvCommand` from hiredis library.
*   The `github.com` content also mentions that enabling `OIDCCacheEncrypt` mitigates this vulnerability, as the keys are hashed cryptographically.
* The fix changes how redis commands are constructed before they are sent to redis.
