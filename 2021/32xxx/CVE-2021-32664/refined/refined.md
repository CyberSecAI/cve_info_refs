The provided content relates to CVE-2021-32664.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. The `run_query.php` page doesn't properly sanitize the input when displaying a base64 decoded string. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected XSS vulnerability in `pages/run_query.php`.
- Lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input, specifically the `$sExpression` parameter which is base64 decoded and displayed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a user's browser session when they visit the vulnerable page.
- This could lead to various impacts such as session hijacking, cookie theft, or redirection to malicious websites.
- The advisory explicitly mentions the vulnerability occurs when logged in as an administrator, meaning the impact can be significant.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL which includes a malicious, base64 encoded payload passed as the `$sExpression` parameter.
- The vulnerable page displays the base64 decoded string.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious base64 encoded payload.
- The attacker must lure a logged-in administrator to click the crafted URL.
- No specific user interaction is required beyond a click, and the exploit is reflected in the browser immediately.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in versions 2.6.5 and 2.7.5 of iTop.
- The specific code changes related to the fix involve the removal of the line echoing the decoded string, which suggests the vulnerability was due to a direct display of unsanitized input.
```diff
-      echo "<strong>FYI: '$sClearText'</strong><br/>\n";
```
- The GitHub Security Advisory (GHSA-j758-ggwg-9mpj) also confirms this information, noting the vulnerability is in the "run query" page.
