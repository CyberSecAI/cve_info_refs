Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of Velocity template code within the titles of dashboard gadgets. Specifically, the XWiki platform was evaluating Velocity code in gadget titles without proper authorization checks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Server-Side Template Injection (SSTI):** The core vulnerability is SSTI. The gadget title field was vulnerable to injection of Velocity code that is then executed server-side.
- **Lack of Authorization Checks:** The system failed to verify if the user had the necessary script or programming rights before processing the Velocity code in the gadget title.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Attackers could inject malicious Velocity code into the gadget title, leading to arbitrary server-side code execution. This would allow them to compromise the XWiki server, access sensitive data, or perform other malicious activities.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Users without script or programming rights could execute code requiring those elevated privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Gadget Title Field:** The primary attack vector is the gadget title field within the dashboard interface. A registered user can create or edit a gadget and insert the malicious code into its title.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Registered User:** The attacker must be a registered user of the XWiki platform.
- **Access to Dashboard:** The attacker must have access to their user profile's dashboard.
- **Ability to Add/Edit Gadgets:** The attacker needs the ability to add or modify gadgets on their dashboard.

**Technical Details:**
- **Payload Example:**  `$request.getServletContext().getAttribute("org.apache.tomcat.InstanceManager").newInstance("javax.script.ScriptEngineManager").getEngineByName("groovy").eval("new File('/etc/passwd').text")`
This payload leverages the Velocity template engine to access the Tomcat instance manager, create a Groovy script engine, and execute arbitrary code. In this case, it's attempting to read the `/etc/passwd` file.
- **Fix:** The fix involves implementing authorization checks to ensure that only users with the necessary 'SCRIPT' rights can have Velocity code evaluated in the gadget titles. The fix is implemented in the `DefaultGadgetSource.java` file, where the evaluation of the title is now wrapped with a check for the 'SCRIPT' user right.

**CVE Information:**
- CVE ID: CVE-2021-32621
- Affected versions: XWiki versions prior to 12.6.7, 12.10.3, and 13.0RC1.
- Patched versions: 12.6.7, 12.10.3, 13.0RC1
- Severity: High
