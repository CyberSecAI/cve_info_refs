Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-32056:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from two combined bugs:
    1. A flaw that allows remote authenticated users to bypass intended access restrictions on server annotations.
    2. A bug that prevents server annotations from being replicated during server replication processes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Access Control Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability for an authenticated user to bypass access controls on server annotations. This means a user can potentially access or modify annotations they should not have permissions for.
- **Replication Failure:** The replication bug prevents server annotations from being replicated, causing inconsistencies between servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Stalled Replication:** By combining the two vulnerabilities, an authenticated remote user can effectively stall server replication.
- **Administrative Intervention Required:** Stalling replication necessitates manual intervention from a system administrator to resolve the issue.
- **Data Inconsistency:** The inability to replicate server annotations could lead to inconsistencies across the replicated servers.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- **Network Access:** The attack likely happens over the network using the IMAP protocol or other supported protocols of Cyrus IMAP (JMAP, CalDAV, CardDAV).
- **Authentication Required:** The attacker must be an authenticated user on the Cyrus IMAP server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have a valid user account on the Cyrus IMAP server.
- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the Cyrus IMAP server.
