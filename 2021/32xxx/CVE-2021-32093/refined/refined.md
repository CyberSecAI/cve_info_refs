The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the Emissary application, including CVE-2021-32093.

**CVE-2021-32093: Arbitrary File Disclosure**

*   **Root Cause:** The application's feature for displaying configuration files does not properly sanitize user-supplied input. Specifically, the `configName` parameter, received from the HTTP GET request, is used to construct a file path without sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The lack of sanitization of the `configName` parameter allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to navigate the file system and access arbitrary files.
    *   **Unrestricted File Access:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to read any file on the server that the application has access to.
*   **Impact:**
    *   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive information, including configuration files, application code, and credentials stored on the server.
    *   **Account Takeover:** Specifically, the attacker can read the file containing the administrator credentials for HTTP Digest Authentication, which can then be used to fully compromise the application.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP GET request to the `/ConfigFile.action` endpoint with a malicious `configName` parameter in the query string.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
    *   This vulnerability requires authentication, but can be chained with a CSRF vulnerability to exploit authenticated users.

**Additional Details**

The content also describes how this vulnerability can be chained with a Reflected Cross-site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CVE-2021-32092) to steal the credentials from an authenticated user. The XSS vulnerability allows an attacker to execute JavaScript in the context of a logged-in user's browser, which can then exploit the file disclosure vulnerability to read the sensitive file and transmit it to the attacker.
The blog post details the vulnerability in the following code block:
```java
32  @GET
33  @Path("/ConfigFile.action")
34  @Produces(MediaType.TEXT_PLAIN)
35  public Response configFile(@QueryParam(CONFIG_PARAM) String configName) {
36    try {
44      String content = IOUtils.toString(
              ConfigUtil.getConfigStream(configName), StandardCharsets.UTF_8);
45      return Response.ok().entity(content).build();
46    }
51  }
```
The vulnerable code is located in `src/main/java/emissary/server/mvc/internal/ConfigFileAction.java`.
