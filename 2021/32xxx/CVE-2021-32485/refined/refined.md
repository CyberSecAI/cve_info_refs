- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Heap-based buffer overflow in the Modem 2G RRM component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A heap buffer overflow due to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation occurs when the device connects to a 2G cellular network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No additional execution privileges are needed, and no user interaction is required. The attacker needs to be able to cause the device to connect to a 2G network.
