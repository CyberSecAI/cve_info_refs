Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32852

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by improper handling of user-controlled input within the `reset.html` template. Specifically, the template uses `<%= message %>` and `<%= password_min %>` to display query parameters in a JavaScript string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. While the template performs HTML escaping for the `message` parameter, it does not escape backslashes. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code by carefully crafting the `message` and `password_min` query parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Client-Side Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they visit a specially crafted link, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Data theft
    - Defacement
    - Other malicious actions performed within the user's session.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL targeting the `reset.html` page with malicious `message` and `password_min` query parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to construct a malicious link and persuade the victim to follow it (e.g., via email, malicious website, etc.).
- The attacker must have an account or be able to create one on the Countly server to trigger the reset password functionality.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in `frontend/express/views/reset.html` and `frontend/express/app.js`.
- The template code is:
  ```html
  showMessage("<%= message %>", "<%= password_min %>");
  ```
- The parameters `message` and `password_min` are taken directly from the query parameters:
  ```javascript
  res.render('reset', {
      ...
      "message": req.query.message || "",
      password_min: req.query.password_min || "",
      ...
  });
  ```
- The exploit involves setting `message` to a single backslash and `password_min` to `, alert(1)); //` which constructs the following malicious JavaScript string:
  ```javascript
  showMessage("\", ", alert(1)); //");
  ```

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in the community edition of Countly.
- The provided content indicates a fix was released in version v21.11.
