this means other users could be invited to that conversation and then they could read past messages, feels like an unwanted side effect.

if we had a way to mark it as archived, like read-only mode but would need an external system user moderator then to prevent anyone to remove there read-only flag

No one cares? Don't want to make it overly complicated so that is good enough. Before you could do screenshares and share them already `¬Ø\_(„ÉÑ)_/¬Ø`

I'm fine with marking it archived by default as well. We could also "demote" the other user to be a normal user and they can then leave the conversation only. But simplicity is the key here I think.

I've tested it and seems fine then.

A good thing is that now that it's a group conversation, the remaining user is able to delete it also.

# Nextcloud Talk not properly disassociating users from chats after account deletion

Moderate

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-xv6f-344w-895c
Jul 12, 2021

## Package

Nextcloud Talk

## Affected versions

< 11.2.2, < 11.3.0

## Patched versions

11.2.2, 11.3.0

## Description

### Impact

If a user was able to reuse an earlier used username, they could get access to any chat message sent to the previous user with this username.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Talk App is upgraded to 11.2.2 or 11.3.0

### Workarounds

Don't allow users to choose usernames themselves. This is the default behaviour of Nextcloud, but some user providers may allow doing so. (e.g. the registration app)

### References

* [HackerOne](https://hackerone.com/reports/1200700)
* [Pull Request](https://github.com/nextcloud/spreed/pull/5633)
