  "CVE-2021-32687": {
    "Description": "Integer to heap buffer overflow with intsets, when set-max-intset-entries is manually configured to a non-default, very large value.",
    "Root cause": "Integer overflow when resizing an intset after the `set-max-intset-entries` configuration parameter is set to a large value.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Integer overflow leading to heap buffer overflow."
    ],
    "Impact": "Heap corruption, which could lead to information leakage or arbitrary code execution.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "Network",
      "Specially crafted commands to manipulate sets."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to change the `set-max-intset-entries` configuration parameter to a very large value and then construct specially crafted commands to manipulate sets"
  }
