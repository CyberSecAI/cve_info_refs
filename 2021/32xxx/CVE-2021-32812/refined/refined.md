Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32812:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) issue within the frontend HTTP server (`frontend/server/server.js`).
- The server, when encountering a 500 error, embeds the user-supplied URL within the error response without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding when handling error responses. The server directly reflects the user-supplied URL in the response, which allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts.
- **Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation:** The server fails to neutralize potentially malicious input (the URL) before including it in the generated HTML page. (CWE-79)
- **Improper Encoding or Escaping of Output:** The server doesn't properly encode or escape the output before displaying it in the error page. (CWE-116)

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **XSS Attack:** By exploiting this vulnerability, an attacker can inject malicious scripts into the error page which will be executed in the context of the user's browser.
- **Potential for Data Theft/Session Hijacking:** Successful exploitation could allow the attacker to steal cookies, session tokens, or other sensitive information.
- **Redirection or Defacement:** An attacker might also redirect the user to a malicious site or deface the application's content.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted URL:** The primary attack vector is a maliciously crafted URL that is sent to the vulnerable server.
- **Triggering a 500 Error:** The attacker needs to craft an HTTP request which will cause a 500 error on the server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know or discover a URL that can trigger the 500 error.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker must be able to create and send HTTP requests containing the malicious URL.
- **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited without any need of authentication.
- **No prior compromise of system required**

**Additional Details:**

- **Affected Versions:** Version 2.90 of the application is vulnerable.
- **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.95.
- **Workaround:** Disk caching plugin can be used as a workaround.
- The fix for the vulnerability involves a change in the error handling logic of the server, which is aimed at preventing the user-supplied URL from being reflected in the response.
