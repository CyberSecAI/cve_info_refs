Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32722:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the GlobalNewFiles MediaWiki extension's improper handling of page move operations. Specifically, the extension was performing database updates in the foreground during page moves, without adequate load balancing, and lacking proper database indexing. This led to excessive database connections when a large number of page moves occurred in a short period.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The extension did not properly manage database connections during file move operations, leading to a potential exhaustion of resources (database connections).
*   **Lack of Load Balancing:** The system was not designed to handle a high volume of page move requests, causing a spike in database activity.
*   **Missing Database Indexing:** The database tables lacked proper indexing, further contributing to performance issues and resource consumption.
*   **Foreground Processing:** Updates were performed synchronously in the foreground rather than asynchronously in the background using a job queue, blocking operations and impacting performance.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A large number of page moves could overwhelm the database server, making the service unavailable to legitimate users. This is evidenced by the "Too many connections" error in the MySQL logs.
*   **Performance Degradation:** The lack of proper indexing and foreground processing caused performance degradation, leading to slow response times and potentially affecting other services dependent on the database.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as the vulnerability is triggered by actions performed on the web application.
*   **Page Move Operations:** The vulnerability is triggered by initiating a large number of page move operations, specifically file moves.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low Privileges:** The attacker needs low privileges, meaning they only need to be a user capable of moving pages, such as a regular user with edit rights, within the MediaWiki instance.
*   **No User Interaction:** The attack can be carried out without requiring interaction from other users, which means a single malicious user could trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

*   The issue was resolved by moving the database update operations to a job queue, which allowed them to run asynchronously in the background, and by adding an appropriate database index.
*   A pull request was created to include the METHOD in the code, to ease debugging.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-32722 and GHSA-cwv5-c938-5h5h.
*   The fix was implemented in commit `48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d`.
