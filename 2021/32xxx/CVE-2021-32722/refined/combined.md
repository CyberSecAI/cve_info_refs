# Description

[@Reception123](/p/Reception123/): Load is way too high. This looks like a DOS. Can you check mysql logs etc to see what was happening around when it started?

Might be worth restarting mysql to kill connections and see if it resumes.

[@RhinosF1](/p/RhinosF1/) I checked cp\* and it didn't seem like there were too many queries (other than Cyberpower's bot). Regarding MySQL I'm not sure how safe restarting is and I'd rather not risk it without someone who knows more than me around.

Connections shouldn't be that high. Can you see what queries are being executed via bin logs?

GlobalNewFiles was causing a large amount of processes on db11. Disabled for the time being and connections have gone down so I hope things should stay calm.

Suggestion from Martin Urbanec is to move it to a job rather than on load assuming it is actually caused by people moving files too quick. He's sent a PR to include METHOD so it's easier to debug

Moving down to normal as the incident is now over and what is left to do is to modify GlobalNewFiles in a way that will avoid someone moving a lot of files from doing this to the database.

# Uncontrolled Resource Consumption in GlobalNewFiles

Moderate

[RhinosF1](/RhinosF1)
published
GHSA-cwv5-c938-5h5h
Jun 26, 2021

## Package

GlobalNewFiles
(MediaWiki Extension)

## Affected versions

Prior to. 48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d

## Patched versions

48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d

## Description

### Impact

A large amount of page moves within a short space of time could overwhelm Database servers due to improper handling of load balancing, lack of an appropriate index on the database and the fact that updates were performed in the foreground rather than using the Jobs system.

### Patches

Use any version after and including commit [48be7ad](https://github.com/miraheze/GlobalNewFiles/commit/48be7adb70568e20e961ea1cb70904454a671b1d)

### Workarounds

You can consider other rate limit solutions like PoolCounter. Impact will vary based on usage and available resources.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
