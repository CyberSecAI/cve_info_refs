{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "A newly discovered capability in the query infrastructure that allows bypassing configured access control and exposes values of private fields.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Access control bypass leading to an oracle attack. The attack method guides an attacker in revealing information they should not have access to.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Field values or field value metadata of private fields or lists can be determined, even with read access control configured, leading to data exposure.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network-based attack.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Low privileges required, no user interaction needed. The complexity of completing the attack is limited by length-dependent behaviors and the fidelity of the exposed information."

    "CVSS score": "7.5 High",
    "CVSS vector": "CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H",
    "Affected versions": "All versions (*)",
