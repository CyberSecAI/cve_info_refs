The provided content relates to CVE-2021-32268.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `url_box_dump` function within `box_dump.c` at line 350 in the GPAC project. This occurs when processing URL boxes in MP4 files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-buffer-overflow due to insufficient bounds checking or incorrect size handling when reading data into a buffer allocated for the URL box location in `isomedia/box_code_base.c`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A heap-buffer-overflow can lead to memory corruption, potentially allowing an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution or cause a denial of service by crashing the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- By crafting a malicious MP4 file with a specially crafted URL box, an attacker can trigger the heap-buffer-overflow during parsing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious MP4 file to the vulnerable MP4Box application.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `isomedia/box_dump.c:350`.
- The provided ASAN output shows the specific memory corruption, along with a stack trace of the function calls leading to the overflow.
- The fix was implemented by adding a check for zero termination, and returning an error if there is no null byte, in `isomedia/box_code_base.c`
- The fix was committed with commit hash `388ecce75d05e11fc8496aa4857b91245007d26e`
