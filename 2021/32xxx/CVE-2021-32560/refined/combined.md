![Hand receiving a coin](/assets/img/financial-support-64x64.png)

This release was made possible only through continued financial support by people like you!

After almost a month of release candidate testing, I’m happy to be able to present you the
next stable OctoPrint release today: 1.6.0 has just been released! 🥳

And like every single release (and release candidate) of OctoPrint ever since early 2016 this
release was made possible only through your continued **[support of my work](/support-octoprint/)** 💕

The [full changelog](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/releases/tag/1.6.0) contains
a long list of new features, improvements and bug fixes, but here are
some of the highlights:

* Timelapses and log files now allow bulk downloads: Select multiple files
  and you’ll be offered to download all of them in one ZIP archive.
* [@cp2004](https://github.com/cp2004) improved the UX for the Plugin Manager and the Software Updater: All buttons and related actions
  have been moved to the top of the dialog, leaving more space for the list of plugins
  and update targets and getting rid of a double scrollbar in the process.
* If OctoPrint’s UI detects you are trying to upload a file that already exists, it’ll now
  prompt you what to do: cancel, rename to a conflict free name or overwrite the existing
  file. You can disable this via the Settings if you prefer the old approach of simply
  always overwriting. Note that this conflict detection only happens if you use OctoPrint’s
  user interface, the API has not been touched.
* Remember the new System Info dialog introduced in 1.5.0? It has been enhanced and now
  also allows downloading a full SystemInfo Bundle, containing not only the system information
  visible in the dialog but also `octoprint.log`, `serial.log` and anything else that’s usually
  requested from you when you report a bug or ask for support on the forums or the Discord server.
  So now you can just download a single bundle zip that contains everything in one go. The bundle
  download is also available on the recovery page (`/recovery`) and can also be requested on the
  command line (via `octoprint systeminfo .`). A [bundle viewer webapp](https://bundleviewer.octoprint.org)
  has also been created that allows viewing these bundles easily in every browser, even on mobile.
* OctoPrint’s backup plugin so far didn’t allow you to restore a backup from a newer version
  than what was currently running. This was done to not run into any compatibility issues when
  you try to restore a current backup on an ancient OctoPrint install. Since this poses problems
  when you have created a backup on an only slightly newer version however (think 1.5.3 vs 1.5.2)
  this has now been slightly disarmed - OctoPrint 1.6 and later will now allow you to restore
  backups from the same major.version version, regardless of patch level. So restoring a backup from
  1.6.1 will be allowed on 1.6.0, restoring a backup from 1.7.0 on 1.6.x won’t.
* As we observed some issues in the community with misconfigured autologin settings,
  OctoPrint will now ensure the validity of IP address ranges configured for that and
  refuse to use invalid ones.
* The logging UI saw some work done by [@eyal0](https://github.com/eyal0) and the workflow of managing log levels during
  development or debugging has been improved by that.
* If OctoPrint detects that it can’t reach the internet, it will now display a small
  offline indicator in the navbar. This should hopefully help people diagnose such issues
  faster.
* A new hook `octoprint.printer.handle_connect` is now in place that allows plugin developers to hook into the process
  of connecting to a printer, prevent that from going through or triggering actions
  based on it in a synchronous fashion.
* The bundled PiSupport Plugin has been extracted into its own project to be able to have
  it on a different release cycle than OctoPrint proper. It is still considered a bundled
  plugin by OctoPrint.
* Several bugs have been fixed, e.g. the config CLI has been fixed so that `octoprint config set plugins.softwareupdate.credentials.github <PAT>` for setting
  the GitHub PAT for the updater’s rate limiting workaround actually works, the expected
  page reload on the login dialog no longer triggers a scary “server offline” message,
  running OctoPrint on Python 3.10 should no longer throw an endless stream of errors,
  and much much more.

### Issues while updating?

On every new OctoPrint release we see some people run into the same issues with
outdated or broken environments all over again. If you encounter a problem during update, please check
[this collection of the most common issues](https://community.octoprint.org/t/my-octoprint-update-fails/37880)
encountered over the past couple of release cycles first, and test if the included
fixes solve your problem.

Also make sure to check any of the heads-ups or plugin incompatibilities listed below.

### Heads-ups

Please read the following carefully, it might impact you and how you use OctoPrint!
Also see the [**Further Information**](#further-information)
and [**Links**](#links) below for more information, where to
find help and how to roll back.

#### Heads-up for plugin authors: Support for the plugin control properties `\_\_plugin\_init\_\_` and `\_\_plugin\_implementations\_\_` (plural!) has been removed

The two plugin control properties `__plugin_init__` and `__plugin_implementations__` (note the plural!) have been deprecated ever since OctoPrint 1.2.0 and have finally been removed.
It is *highly* unlikely that your plugin has ever used them given that they were already marked as deprecated for the very first version of OctoPrint to ever even support plugins. Still, just in the case of anyone out there making use of them regardless, here’s a heads-up that they will no longer be utilized in OctoPrint 1.6+.

### Thanks

Thanks to everyone who contributed to this release and provided full,
analyzable bug reports, suggestions, feedback and - of course - funding!

A special **Thank You!** to these 17 fine people for their PRs!

### Insights

If you are interested in some numbers, here's some data extracted from the
**anonymous usage tracking** for the RCs that
went before 1.6.0's stable release:

* 1.6.0rc1 (2021-03-30): 1122 instances, 35400h or 4.0 years of accumulative printing time
* 1.6.0rc2 (2021-04-14): 964 instances, 18300h or 2.1 years of accumulative printing time
* 1.6.0rc3 (2021-04-21): 878 instances, 9440h or 1.1 years of accumulative printing time

Overall there were 1702 instances that participated in the
RC testing phase and which collectively completed 63264h or 7.2 years of print jobs.

# The (in)secure story of OctoPrint

11 May 2021  » [web-applications](/category/web-applications)

![octoprint logo](/static/img/posts/octoprint_logo.png)

# TL;DR

When an attacker gains access to publicly exposed and insecured OctoPrint panel he can execute commands on the host due to the way the application is designed. In order to secure your OctoPrint instances **NEVER** expose the host to the public access and if you have to, use VPN or other access control to secure it.

# The application

One time when I was browsing github in a quest for finding an interesting software to fiddle a little bit with, I came across an application named OctoPrint. If you’re into 3D printing this name may ring a bell with you. That is because OctoPrint is a software that brings a nice and responsive web interface to your 3D printer, and from what I have deducted, it is pretty popular among the 3D printing community. In fact there is a ton of features that come along with this software such as project files upload, live print monitoring and even custom plugin installation. As you probably imagine this sounded as a juicy app to put on the workbench.

# First blood

Nice thing about OctoPrint is that it can be installed as a Python package, so the installation boils down to simple `pip install OctoPrint`. After the installation the web interface can be accessed on the default port 5000. Initial configuration allows us to set administrator password and set variables for 3D printer (which I obviously didn’t own at the moment of testing the app).

![octoprint1](/static/img/posts/octoprint1.png)

After logging in to a privileged account (Administrator or Operator) there is quite a lot of web interface functionalities to fiddle with. What caught my attention was that the application allows you to install custom plugins as Python packages right from the web interface.

![octoprint2](/static/img/posts/octoprint2.png)

How dangerous installation of untrusted packages can be, was very nicely describen by **Aryx** in his [blog](https://www.ayrx.me/look-before-you-pip) (not mentioning the package confusion vulnerabilities). By leveraging this we can easily modify an existing plugin and turn it into a malicious one. Then we can use it to execute system commands using Python `os` library. By adding the following code to the `setup.py` file we can run commands on the host.
```
import os
os.system('echo "pwned" > /tmp/octoprint')
```

Then we have to upload the plugin.

![octoprint3](/static/img/posts/octoprint3.png)

And we have confirmed RCE.

![octoprint4](/static/img/posts/octoprint4.png)

So by altering plugin code we can achieve RCE on the host but this behaviour is quite obvious and is unavoidable when installing packages without any encryption on integrity check.

# Kill two birds with one stone

Another interesting functionality is that administrators can specify what commands can be run on the host, in order to reboot, or shut down the operating system, or to restart an OctoPrint instance.

![octoprint11](/static/img/posts/octoprint11.png)

These commands are executed using Python `subprocess` with shell argument set to `True` as can be seen on the following code snippet.
```
try:

       def execute():
           # we run this with shell=True since we have to trust whatever
           # our admin configured as command and since we want to allow
           # shell-alike handling here...
           p = sarge.run(
               command_spec["command"],
               close_fds=CLOSE_FDS,
               stdout=sarge.Capture(),
               stderr=sarge.Capture(),
               shell=True,
           )

```

This means that all commands passed to this function will be executed just as they would be typed in the terminal on host (more or less). Adding that such execution is triggered by a simple POST request to an API endpoint, with just a few lines of code we can write an exploit that executes reverse shell payload on the host.

This obviously poses security risk but to exploit this functionalities one must have `Administrator` or `Operator` privileges in the application. From attacker perspective this can be obtained by bypassing authentication or taking over an already created account.

# Show me the logz

It is nice to be able to debug stuff right from the web interface and OctoPrint gives us this opportunity to not only download and manage log files from the browser, but also to specify the exact path where the files are saved. By using OctoPrint interface we can configure all the logging paths.

![octoprint5](/static/img/posts/octoprint5.png)

And list or download all the log files in the specified directory.

![octoprint6](/static/img/posts/octoprint6.png)

Interestingly, if the path is changed to any writable path, the application will gladly include all files in the directory and list them in the web interface. This wouldn’t be too bad at all however user can not only view the files but also download them. Considering this, it is possible to change the log folder to i.e. `~/.ssh/` directory and get access to SSH private keys.

![octoprint7](/static/img/posts/octoprint7.png) ![octoprint8](/static/img/posts/octoprint8.png)

If the host has SSH service running we could gain a stealthy and persistent access this way.

# Not existing path is an existing problem

After some fuzzing I eventually found a reflected XSS in the `/api/files` endpoint. The web server was behaving weird when a non existing file was requested or upon making a HTTP DELETE request to it. The path was echoed back together with an error message. The coffin to the nail was that the path was URL decoded which meant that injecting any type of bracket to the document body is possible. Simple `img` payload did the trick.
```
<img src=x onerror=alert(1)>
```

![octoprint9](/static/img/posts/octoprint9.png)

# Summary and security reminder

When considering the severity of the above vulnerabilities we must keep in mind that OctoPrint software was never meant to be exposed to the web as it integrates with physical device that is 3D printer. The dangers of such integration were thoroughly described by **@xme** in the following [article](https://isc.sans.edu/forums/diary/3D%2BPrinters%2Bin%2BThe%2BWild%2BWhat%2BCan%2BGo%2BWrong/24044/). At the time of writing this article over 500 hosts that can be identified as OctoPrint interfaces were listed on Shodan (though this number is slowly decreasing it is still a large number of potential targets).

![octoprint10](/static/img/posts/octoprint10.png)

For maximum security never expose OctoPrint interface to the internet and deploy it locally on a host physically separated from your network i.e. Raspberry Pi. If the remote access is needed always make sure that the application is only accessible via VPN with strong security controls. If you want live preview or control over the printing consider using native OctoPrint plugins such as [Telegram bot](https://github.com/fabianonline/OctoPrint-Telegram) for monitoring the printing process.

[`b6ebe7c`](/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/commit/b6ebe7c8539b86acb217483b853910d23518967f)

### Heads-up for plugin authors: Support for the plugin control properties `__plugin_init__` and `__plugin_implementations__` (plural!) has been removed

The two plugin control properties `__plugin_init__` and `__plugin_implementations__` (note the plural!) have been deprecated ever since OctoPrint 1.2.0 and have finally been removed.

It is *highly* unlikely that your plugin has ever used them given that they were already marked as deprecated for the very first version of OctoPrint to ever even support plugins. Still, just in the case of anyone out there making use of them regardless, here's a heads-up that they will no longer be utilized in OctoPrint 1.6+.

### Features & improvements

* [#3544](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3544) - Timelapse: Bulk downloads of multiple timelapses in one zip archive. See also [#3856](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3856).
* [#3595](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3595) - GCode Viewer: "Center viewport on model" and "Zoom in on model" now take the current layer's bounding box into account, instead of the whole model's. See also [#3880](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3880).
* [#3711](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3711) - Plugin Manager: Button to export the list of installed plugins to a machine readable JSON file. See also [#3833](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3833).
* [#3746](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3746) - Logging: Bulk downloads of multiple logs in one zip archive.
* [#3801](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3801) - Get rid of double scrollbars in Plugin Manager and Software Update settings dialogs. See also [#3835](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3835) and [#3836](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3836).
* [#3818](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3818) - Backup: Base the backup name on the configured instance name.
* [#3819](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3819) - File search now searches through both internal and displayed file name.
* [#3828](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3828) - Separate error messages from connection state on Printer Status and Job API by introducing a new `error` field next to `state`.
* [#3830](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3830) - Reword the warning about using the global API key.
* [#3835](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3835) - PMGR: Improve UX by moving notices to a collapsible "info" section at the top of the window, moving the Get More button to the top bar, fixing the top bar when scrolled and highlighting available notices with red icon & text and an auto-show if needed.
* [#3836](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3836) - SWU: Improve UX by moving check for updates & update all buttons to the top of the interface & moving advanced options to a collapsed section at the top of the interface.
* [#3840](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3840) - Add an indicator to the frontend if OctoPrint detects it can't connect to the internet.
* [#3866](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3866) - Backup: Add plugin helpers `create_backup` and `delete_backup`.
* [#3873](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3873) - A new file name collision dialog is now triggered on upload if the uploaded file is detected as already existing on the server. The dialog allows to cancel the upload, rename the file or forcefully overwrite the file already on disk. This confirmation dialog can be disabled via Settings > Features to restore the old behaviour (overwrite without asking).
* [#3882](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3882) - For determining `pip` behaviour and Python environment, capture testballoon output from the `pip` call's stdout/stderr instead of a temporary file.
* [#3885](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3885) - Support permission objects as keys to `SettingsPlugin.get_settings_restricted_paths`, instead of just `user`, `admin`, `never`. This allows plugin authors to more granular control on which settings get presented to what user types.
* [#3895](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3895) - Ensure connectivity check wizard comes before usage tracking wizard. See also [#3918](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3918).
* [#3903](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3903) - Add two new events `GcodeScript${ScriptName}Running` and `GcodeScript${ScriptName}Finished` that will be triggered when gcode scripts are run.
* [#3919](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3919) - systemd: Change service type in bundled unit file to exec
* [#3920](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3920) - Add an ES5 polyfill to improve compatibility of third party plugins on really old browsers.
* [#3924](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3924) - Tracking: Allow to change your decision made in the wizard before submitting it.
* [#3925](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3925) - Announcement: Set default state to avoid pop-in
* [#3925](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3925) - Action Command Prompt: Fix icon
* [#3942](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3942) - Blacklist: Allow to change your decision made in the wizard before submitting it.
* [#3943](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3943) - Connectivity check: Allow to change your decision made in the wizard before submitting it.
* [#3944](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3944) - Add frontend callback `onUserSettingsBeforeSave` that gets called on core components and registered plugin view models when user settings are saved.
* [#3946](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3946) - Ensure validity of IP address ranges configured for autologin and refuse to use invalid ones.
* [#3947](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3947) - Logging: Automatically add logger on selection. See also [#3957](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3957).
* [#3950](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3950) - Logging: Start new config with empty logger. See also [#3951](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3951).
* [#3952](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3952) - Logging: Save logging settings only when there actually were changes. See also [#3953](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3953) and [#3949](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3949).
* [#3958](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3958) - Include `slicing.defaultSlicer` on the settings API.
* [#3963](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3963) - Improve error message during server startup if [a Python bug with non-ASCII host names](https://bugs.python.org/issue26227) gets encountered.
* [#3966](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3966) - Add IDs and classes to terminal panels and buttons, to allow easier targeting from third party plugins.
* [#3972](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3972) - Timelapse: the used ffmpeg command line can now be configured in detail
* [#3978](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/3978) - Remove redundant Python 2 `float` conversion relics.
* [#3984](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3984) - Add a hook `octoprint.printer.handle_connect` for plugins to prevent a connect from going through.
* [#3987](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3987) - Enforce scrollbars to be visible on Safari
* [#3993](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3993) - Backup: Add warning for backups that are too big to restore via upload.
* [#4017](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/4017) - GCode Viewer: New option to make the viewer ignore all commands until a certain line in the file is found. This can be used to ignore priming lines.
* [#4024](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4024) - SWU: Improve error reporting in case of detected undervoltage/overheating.
* [#4031](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/4031) - PMGR: Change default sorting of repository view from "name" to "popularity".
* [#4035](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4035) - PMGR: The API endpoint `api/plugin/pluginmanager` has been deprecated and split into `plugin/pluginmanager/plugins`, `plugin/pluginmanager/orphans` and `plugin/pluginmanager/repository`. There's also now `plugin/pluginmanager/<key>` to retrieve information for a specific plugin by its identifier.
* [#4049](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/4049) - Improve consistency in the settings headers.
* [#4050](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/4050) - Default temperature regex of terminal filters now also recognizes `C`, `P`, `R` and `L` values as support by Marlin, as well as negative values.
* [#4050](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/4050) - Docs: `pip install` command should use quoted source for maximum compatibility with people's dev environments.
* [#4080](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4080) (regression) - Fix horizontal scrollbar size in Safari and get rid of horizontal scrolling in notifications altogether.
* [#4082](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/4082) (regression) - Fix SD card printing
* [#4102](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/pull/4102) - Add option to revert back to former behaviour of always lower casing SD Card file names reported by the firmware to work around a bug in Prusa Firmware ([prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware#3115](https://github.com/prusa3d/Prusa-Firmware/issues/3115)). Auto detect Prusa Firmware and automatically enable this option if firmware autodetection is enabled. See also [#3994](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3994) for reference.
* New `--overlay` command line flag to defined additional config overlays to apply to OctoPrint's defaults before loading `config.yaml`. This will allow preconfiguration by distributions without the risk to bundle environment specific presets in backups that might then no longer fit presets required on later versions (as seen in [#3821](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint/issues/3821)).
* OctoPrint now provides a downloadable SystemInfo bundle that contains system information, `octoprint.log`, `serial.log`, `plugin_pluginmanager_console.log` and `plugin_softwareupdate_console.log`. A [bundle viewer](https://bundleviewer.octoprint.org) allows easy viewing of bundles. SystemBundles are going to become mandatory for bug reports and you can also expect them to be requested from you when seeking support on the forums or the Discord server. It can be acquired through OctoPrint's About dialog, the recovery page and the command line (via `octoprint systeminfo <directory>`).
* New action commands supported: `sd_inserted`, `sd_ejected`, `sd_updated`. May be used by firmware to explicitly inform OctoPrint about SD card changes.
* Only import plugins if their metadata contains any control property. This is to protect against loading things from the plugin folders that aren't even plugins, like errant setup.py files.
* Remove deprecated plugin control properties `__plugin_init__` and `__plugin_implementations__` (plural!)
* Remove support for plugins only provided as `pyc` files, as that would not work with our pre-load validation and never was officially supported anyhow.
* Add `min`/`max` properties to `octoprint.util.CountedEvent`.
* Make size of last line buffer in comm layer configurable via `serial.lastLineBufferSize`.
* Protect against `null` scripts sent by clients.
* Connectivity check: Default to `1.1.1.1` for online check. Less controversial than `8.8.8.8`.
* Make the `tornado.access` log less verbose for `/api/printer`. 409 returns on this endpoint are common if the printer is not currently connected. Reduce log spam by rewriting such requests to INFO level, which by default won't get logged.
* Clarify in the UI that OctoPrint does not control the webcam.
* All JSON and YAML will now be dumped with 2 space indentation.
* Don't return input params in error messages on the API as that might open up clients that don't escape errors to XSS.
* Fail fast on invalid file names requested on the files API.
* Use `flask.abort` where it makes sense.
* Default to JSON errors on all API endpoints including blueprints.
* `octoprint.util.time_this` decorator can now also log on entering the decorated function.
* Performance improvements on the files API.
* Ignore SD card messages from the firmware if SD support is disabled in OctoPrint.
* Backup: Allow restore of backups from newer patch versions. E.g. it will now be possible to restore a backup from 1.6.1 under 1.6.0, but still not possible to restore a backup from 1.7.x under 1.6.x.
* GCode Viewer: Improve identifiers in settings dialog.
* Logging: Don't manage anything but `*.log` files.
* PiSupport: Extracted into its own project at [OctoPrint/OctoPrint-PiSupport](https://github.com/OctoPrint/OctoPrint-PiSupport) on its own release cycle. Required by OctoPrint and still considered bundled.
* Tracking: Add printer state to `ping` event. That will allow us to get a general idea of actively used vs idle instances. A huge number of instances in an error state could also be an indicator of problems with a release.
* SWU: Additional check overlay for Python 2 instances. This will allow to disable software update for future Py3 plugins, or redefine update URLs and the like for plugins to allow for security updates or similar from an alternative repository. See [this post on the community forums](https://community.octoprint.org/t/maintaining-python-2-compatibility/30494/14) for details.
* Update the bundled modernizr.
* Update the FirmwareCheck dependency to `2021.2.4`
* Remove unused `rsa` dependency (was slated for removal with 1.4.0 already and just got forgotten).
* Add ESLint and pyupgrade to pre-commit checks.
* Some refactoring here and there
