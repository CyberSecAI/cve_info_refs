Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32630:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two primary issues:
1. **Insufficient file extension filtering**: The application allows the upload of files, and while there's some filtering to block potentially harmful extensions like `.php`, `.phtml`, and `.php5`, it does not block the `.phar` extension.
2. **Inadequate input validation for local file inclusion**: The application attempts to block directory traversal by checking for `/` in filenames, but this can be bypassed by double URL encoding the `/` character.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

1. **Unrestricted File Upload**: Allowing the upload of `.phar` files, which can contain executable PHP code, creates a direct path to Remote Code Execution (RCE).
2. **Local File Inclusion (LFI)**: The ability to use the "move to db" function to retrieve local files through directory traversal, bypassing input validation via double encoding.
3. **Information Disclosure**: Default Apache configuration allows indexing, which can expose MySQL backup files containing sensitive information like user hashes and SMTP credentials. While passwords are required to be strong and are hashed, offline cracking is still a possibility.

**Impact of exploitation:**

1. **Remote Code Execution (RCE)**: An attacker with upload permissions can upload a malicious PHP web shell disguised as a `.phar` file. When this file is accessed, the code is executed, leading to RCE.
2. **Local File Inclusion (LFI):** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server, such as `/etc/passwd`, by using double-encoded directory traversal sequences.
3. **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can download database backups, potentially leading to the compromise of user accounts, SMTP credentials, and other sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**

1. **File Upload**: The attacker uploads a `.phar` file containing malicious PHP code through the "Documents & Files" upload feature.
2. **Directory Traversal**: The attacker crafts a file name with double URL encoded directory traversal characters (%252e%252e%252f) to read arbitrary files through the "move to db" functionality.
3. **Direct Access to Backup Files**: If the default Apache configuration is present, attackers can directly access and download MySQL backup files through the web interface if indexing is allowed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

1. **For RCE and LFI**: The attacker needs to have an account with upload permissions, which could be an administrative user or any user with the ability to upload files through the Documents & Files feature.
2. **For Information Disclosure**: The attacker needs network access to the server and knowledge of where database backups are stored. Exploiting this issue requires no authentication.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 4.0.4 by blocking the upload of `.phar` files and by applying a fix for directory traversal.
- The information disclosure vulnerability is related to a server misconfiguration, not a specific application vulnerability.
- The issue was tracked in issues #993 and #994.
