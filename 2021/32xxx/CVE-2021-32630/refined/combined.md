# Possible upload of PHAR files and wrong check of backslash in filenames

Moderate

[Fasse](/Fasse)
published
GHSA-xpqj-67r8-25j2
May 20, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

4.0.3

## Patched versions

4.0.4

## Description

### Impact

-Authenticated RCE via .PHAR File Upload. Need admin or upload permissions.

A php web shell can be uploaded via the Documents & Files upload feature. Someone with upload permissions could rename the php shell with a .phar extension, visit the file, triggering the payload for a reverse/bind shell. This can be mitigated by excluding a .phar file extension to be uploaded (like you did with .php .phtml .php5 etc)

-Authenticated Local File Inclusion. Need admin or upload permissions.

Someone with upload permissions can use the move to db ability to "get" local files and move to the Documents & Folders view. The mitigation to block "/" from file names works, but if you double encode it, it bypasses the check...

<http://127.0.0.1/admidio/adm_program/modules/documents-files/documents_files_function.php?mode=6&folder_id=1&name=%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252f%252e%252e%252fetc%252fpasswd>

This example should load /etc/passwd to the files and docs page for someone to download and read. This might be able to be mitigated by using a strip slashes type of function in php before the function is called. (I think line 341-342 in documents\_files\_function.php)

-Unauthenticated Information Disclosure via exposed MySQL backups.

This is mostly a default apache config that could be considered a "misconfiguration" by users who install Admidio. If indexing in apache is allowed (it is be default), and an admin creates a db backup, then an attacker could view and download the db's .gz and extract the user hashes, messages, smtp creds and more. Since the passwords are required to be strong by default, and hashed, it would prevent an attacker from easily obtaining passwords..but could be done offline with time and a powerful GPU/CPU.
