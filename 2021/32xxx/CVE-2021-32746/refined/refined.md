Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-32746:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a path traversal issue in the `doc` module of Icinga Web 2.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Path Traversal:** The `doc` module allows an attacker to access arbitrary files on the server by manipulating the `image` parameter in the URL. Specifically, the vulnerability exists in how the module handles the `image` parameter, allowing directory traversal using `..`.
- The affected versions of Icinga Web 2 are 2.3.0 to 2.8.2.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Read:** An attacker can read any file on the server that is accessible to the web server user. This could include sensitive configuration files, application data, or other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request:** By crafting a specific URL with path traversal sequences, an attacker can exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerable URL pattern is `/icingaweb2/doc/module/image?moduleName=doc&image=../../../../etc/os-release`, where the `image` parameter contains the path traversal sequences.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Icinga Web 2 instance.
- **Access to doc module:** The attacker requires access to the `doc` module, which must be enabled manually by an administrator, and the user must have explicit access permissions.

**Additional Information:**
- The `doc` module is not enabled by default and requires manual activation by an administrator.
- The vulnerability can be detected in web server access logs using the provided grep command `grep -Pie '(?<=GET|POST ).+/doc/module/image?(.*image=((\.|%2e)(\.|%2e)(/|%2f)){3,}\S*| )' access.logâ€‹`.
- Patched versions: 2.7.5, 2.8.3, and 2.9.0
- Workaround: Disable the `doc` module or revoke permission to use it from all users.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" severity.
