# What's New in Version 2.8.3

**Notice**: This is a security release. It is recommended to upgrade to this release if you don't plan to upgrade to v2.9.0.

You can find all fixes related to this release on our [Project](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/projects/7).

## Security Fixes

This release includes two security related fixes. Both were published as part of a security advisory on Github.

They allow the circumvention of custom variable protection rules and blacklists as well as a path traversal if

the `doc` module is enabled. Please check the respective advisory for details.

* Custom variable protection and blacklists can be circumvented [GHSA-2xv9-886q-p7xx](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/security/advisories/GHSA-2xv9-886q-p7xx)
* Possible path traversal by use of the `doc` module [GHSA-cmgc-h4cx-3v43](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/security/advisories/GHSA-cmgc-h4cx-3v43)

# Possible path traversal by use of the `doc` module

Moderate

[nilmerg](/nilmerg)
published
GHSA-cmgc-h4cx-3v43
Jul 12, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

2.3.0 to 2.8.2

## Patched versions

2.7.5, 2.8.3 and 2.9.0

## Description

### Impact

The `doc` module of Icinga Web 2 allows to view documentation directly in the UI. It must be enabled manually by an administrator and users need explicit access permission to use it.

Then, by visiting the following route `/icingaweb2/doc/module/image?moduleName=doc&image=../../../../etc/os-release`, it is possible to gain access to arbitrary files readable by the web-server user.

### Patches

The issue has been fixed in the v2.7.5, v2.8.3 and v2.9.0 releases.

### Workarounds

Disable the `doc` module or revoke permission to use it from all users.

### Who Is Affected

If you had already been a victim of this vulnerability can only be verified by inspecting the web server's access log.

Manifestations of such a request in the access log can be identified with this command:

`grep -Pie '(?<=GET|POST ).+/doc/module/image?(.*image=((\.|%2e)(\.|%2e)(/|%2f)){3,}\S*| )' access.log​`

### References

None

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-32746

### Weaknesses

No CWEs

# What's New in Version 2.9.0

You can find all issues related to this release on our [Roadmap](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/milestone/59?closed=1).

Please make sure to also check the respective [upgrading section](https://icinga.com/docs/icinga-web-2/latest/doc/80-Upgrading/#upgrading-to-icinga-web-2-29x) in the documentation.

This release is accompanied by the minor releases v2.7.5 and v2.8.3 which include the security fixes mentioned below.

## Icinga DB

We continue our endeavour soon. Icinga Web 2 is still a crucial part of it and this update is again required

for Icinga DB. If you like to participate again, don't forget to update Icinga Web 2 as well.

## Security Fixes

This release includes two security related fixes. Both were published as part of a security advisory on Github.

They allow the circumvention of custom variable protection rules and blacklists as well as a path traversal if

the `doc` module is enabled. Please check the respective advisory for details.

* Custom variable protection and blacklists can be circumvented [GHSA-2xv9-886q-p7xx](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/security/advisories/GHSA-2xv9-886q-p7xx)
* Possible path traversal by use of the `doc` module [GHSA-cmgc-h4cx-3v43](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/security/advisories/GHSA-cmgc-h4cx-3v43)

## RBAC, The Elephant In Icinga Web 2

Role Based Access Control, for the non-initiated. I'll make it short: Permission refusals, Role inheritance,

Privilege Audit. Icinga DB will also solve the long-standing issue [#2455](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/issues/2455) and also allows [#3349](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/issues/3349) and [#3550](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/issues/3550).

I've also written a blog post about this very topic: <https://icinga.com/blog/2021/04/07/web-access-control-redefined/>

* Authorization enhancements [#4306](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/pull/4306)
* Audit View [#4336](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/pull/4336)
* Highlight modules with permissions set inside a role [#4241](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/issues/4241)

## Support for PHP 8

PHP 8 is released and with Icinga Web 2.9 it will now (hopefully) work flawlessly. We also took the chance

to prepare to drop the support of some legacy PHP versions. We now require PHP 7.3 at a minimum and all

versions below that will not be supported anymore with the release of v2.11.

* Support PHP 8 [#4289](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/pull/4289)
* Raise minimum required PHP version to 7.3 [#4397](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/pull/4397)

## Stay, Be Remembered

Have you ever been disappointed that Icinga Web 2 always forgets you after closing your browser? This is in

your hands now! Just tick the new checkbox on the login screen and Icinga Web 2 doesn't forget your presence

anymore. Unless of course the administrator or you on a different device clears your session.

* Implement a "remember me" feature [#2495](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/issues/2495)

## It Does Matter, When

Browsers are bad when it's about date and time inputs. (I'm looking at you Mozilla!) Now we've given our hopes

up and use a specifically invented solution to show you a date and time picker throughout every browser. With

Icinga v2.13 onwards you will also be able to use this when defining an expiry date for comments! Though, you

might not necessarily use it that often once you've configured new custom defaults for downtime endings.

* Add datetime picker widget [#4354](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/pull/4354)
* Expire Option for Comments [#3447](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/issues/3447)
* Custom defaults for downtime end, comment and duration [#4364](https://github.com/Icinga/icingaweb2/issues/4364)
