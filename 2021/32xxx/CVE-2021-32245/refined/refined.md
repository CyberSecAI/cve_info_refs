Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32245:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `github.com_bbdf0f47_20250115_222140.html` directly references CVE-2021-32245 and provides details about the vulnerability. The other files do not appear to have any relevant information and are related to general GitHub functionality and are therefore excluded.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization or filtering of SVG files uploaded through the PageKit CMS file upload feature. Malicious scripts embedded within these SVG files are not removed, allowing for a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attack.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Stored XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. The malicious payload (JavaScript within an SVG file) is stored on the server.
    *   **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The system fails to sanitize or filter uploaded SVG files, allowing potentially harmful content to be stored.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into the website.
    *   This allows the attacker to potentially:
        *   Hijack user sessions.
        *   Redirect users to malicious sites.
        *   Steal sensitive user information (cookies, session tokens).
        *   Perform other unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **File Upload:** The attacker uploads a malicious SVG file via the CMS's file upload mechanism.
    *   **Link Creation:** The attacker creates a link on the website pointing to the uploaded malicious SVG file (`/storage/exp.svg`).
    *   **User Interaction:** The attack is triggered when a user clicks the link, causing the browser to execute the embedded JavaScript within the SVG.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **CMS Access:** The attacker needs to have the ability to upload files via the CMS interface. This typically requires some level of authorization within the CMS system.
    *   **Link Creation:** The attacker needs the capability to create links within the website's content.

**3. Additional Details:**
*   **Affected Versions:** PageKit versions 1.0.18 and earlier are vulnerable.
*   **Patched Versions:** No patched versions are mentioned in the content.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 score of 5.4, indicating a moderate severity.
    *   **CVSS Metrics:** AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N. This translates to: Network attack vector, Low attack complexity, Low privileges required, User interaction required, Scope Changed, Low Confidentiality impact, Low Integrity impact, and No Availability impact.
*   **EPSS Score:** The EPSS score is 0.054%
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is classified as CWE-79 (Cross-site Scripting).

**Summary**
CVE-2021-32245 is a moderate severity stored XSS vulnerability in PageKit CMS that arises from insufficient input sanitization of uploaded SVG files. An attacker can exploit this by uploading a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript, then trick a user into clicking a link to that file, resulting in execution of malicious scripts in the user's browser.
