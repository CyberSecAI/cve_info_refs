      "date_of_analysis": "2024-01-15",
       "analysis": {
        "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the processing of user input within the Chart Generator of Pandora FMS. Specifically, the `$_REQUEST['session_id']` parameter is passed to the constructor of the `PandoraFMS\\User` class without any sanitization. This value is then used in a database query without proper sanitization leading to a Phar deserialization vulnerability.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Phar deserialization",
           "SQL Injection (indirect)"
        ],

          "Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF)"

        "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires no prior knowledge, access privilege, or specific configuration of the target system. The attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely.",
         "additional_notes": "The SQL injection is an indirect attack vector, as the primary vulnerability is the phar deserialization."

       "date_of_analysis": "2024-01-15",
      "analysis": {
       "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability exists in Pandora FMSâ€™ PHP source code. Specifically, a failure to properly sanitize user input and the use of a wrapper which allows access to `$_GET` or `$_POST` variables directly could be exploited by attackers.",
        "vulnerabilities": [
          "Phar deserialization",

        "attack_vectors": [
         "Visiting a crafted, malicious website that triggers the vulnerability via the victim's browser.",
