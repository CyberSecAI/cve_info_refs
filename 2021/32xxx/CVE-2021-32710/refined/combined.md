|  |  | issue: NEXT-13664 |
|  |  | author: Timo Altholtmann |
|  |  | --- |
|  |  | # Storefront |
|  |  | \* Changed behaviour of the setting `invalidateSessionOnLogOut` in `loginRegistration.xml` which can be found under settings -> login / registration. |
|  |  | \* The session of the user now gets invalidated on every logout, regardless of the value of this setting. This settings controls only, if the cart gets saved on logout. |
