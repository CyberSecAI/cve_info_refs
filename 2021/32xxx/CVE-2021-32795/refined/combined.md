# Denial of Service via Steam chat (< 4.3.1.0)

Moderate

[JustArchi](/JustArchi)
published
GHSA-5v34-4prm-9474
Oct 14, 2020

## Package

ArchiSteamFarm
(GitHub)

## Affected versions

Between ≥ 4.3.0.0 and < 4.3.1.0

## Patched versions

≥ 4.3.1.0

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

It's Denial of Service (aka DoS) vulnerability which allows attacker to remotely crash running ASF instance through sending a specifically-crafted Steam chat message. The user sending the message does not need to be authorized within the bot or ASF process. Other message channels (IPC and interactive console) are not affected. The attacker needs to know ASF's `CommandPrefix` in advance, which is impossible to achieve without prior brute-forcing attempts, but majority of ASF setups run with a sane, unchanged default value.

This attack does not allow attacker to gain any potentially-sensitive information, such as logins or passwords, does not allow to execute arbitrary commands and otherwise exploit the crash further. It's only a crash of service (DoS), with no further implications, therefore of moderate severity.

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The issue is patched in ASF V4.3.1.0 and future versions.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

The only workaround which guarantees complete protection is running all bots with `OnlineStatus` of `0` (Offline). In this setup, ASF is able to ignore even the specifically-crafted message without attempting to interpret it.

It's possible to attempt to mitigate this problem by ensuring that users can't send the message to ASF bots through the Steam platform, therefore removing the attack vector, but due to the internals of Steam platform, it's impossible to achieve that entirely and therefore doesn't guarantee absolute protection.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

The issue was originally reported at <https://steamcommunity.com/groups/archiasf/discussions/1/2935742047969570844/>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Start from posting a full log from the crash. A few last logs are recorded for you in logs directory, so you can find the crash one even after a restart.

Okay so this is 3rd time this happens now. I've included a few lines from the log before the crash happened these 3 times.

do you understand what **full** log means? Pro hint: it's not the same as "a few lines from the log before the crash".

If you're unable to post full log as asked, you can as well fix the error yourself and send a PR, because everything works fine for me and doesn't crash.

This issue is fixed in ASF V4.3.1.0, thanks for report, even though you didn't do everything to help us tackle it down as asked.
