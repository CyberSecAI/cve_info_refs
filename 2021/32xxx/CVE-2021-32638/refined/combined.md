This commit adds two new ways of specifying GitHub auth:

1. from the GITHUB_TOKEN environment variable
2. from standard input

This commit does not include any documentation changes and the
descriptions of new command line options will need to be tweaked.

This commit does not belong to any branch on this repository, and may belong to a fork outside of the repository.

Remove --external-repository-token option from runner

```
Specifying a token as a cli input leads to a potential for leaking the
token on CI logs. This commit removes the option. Instead, users
should specify a single GitHub token through `--github-auth-stdin` or
by setting the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable. This token should be
created with enough privileges to access the required repository.

# CodeQL runner: Command-line options that make GitHub access tokens visible to other processes are now deprecated

Moderate

## Package

CodeQL runner
(CodeQL runner)

## Affected versions

< codeql-bundle-20210304

## Patched versions

codeql-bundle-20210304

## Description

### Impact

The CodeQL runner tool, provided to run CodeQL-based code scanning on non-GitHub CI/CD systems, requires a GitHub access token to connect to a GitHub repository.

The runner and its documentation previously suggested passing the GitHub token as a command-line parameter to the process instead of reading it from a file, standard input, or an environment variable. For example:

```
/path/to-runner/codeql-runner-linux <command> <args> --github-auth TOKEN

```

This approach made the token visible to other processes on the same machine, for example in the output of the `ps` command.

If the CI system publicly exposes the output of `ps`, for example by logging the output, then the GitHub access token can be exposed beyond the scope intended.

Users of the CodeQL runner on 3rd-party systems, who are passing a GitHub token via the `--github-auth` flag, are affected. This applies to both GitHub.com and GitHub Enterprise users.

Users of the CodeQL Action on GitHub Actions are not affected.

### Mitigation / new behavior

The `--github-auth` flag is now considered insecure and deprecated. The undocumented `--external-repository-token` flag has been removed. To securely provide a GitHub access token to the CodeQL runner, users should **do one of the following instead**:

* Use the `--github-auth-stdin` flag and pass the token on the command line via standard input:
  ```
  echo "$TOKEN" | /path/to-runner/codeql-runner-linux <command> <args> --github-auth-stdin

  ```
* Set the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable to contain the token, then call the command without passing in the token:
  ```
  # set GITHUB_TOKEN to the token, using your CI system's secret storage mechanism
  /path/to-runner/codeql-runner-linux <command> <args>

  ```

The old flag remains present for backwards compatibility with existing workflows. If the user tries to specify an access token using the `--github-auth` flag, there is a deprecation warning printed to the terminal that directs the user to one of the above options.

For more information, see the GitHub documentation pages linked below.

### Patches

All CodeQL runner releases from <https://github.com/github/codeql-action/releases/tag/codeql-bundle-20210304> onwards contain the patches:

* [88714e3](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/88714e3a60e72ec53caa0e6a203652ee1f3fb1db) deprecates the `--github-auth` flag
* [58defc0](https://github.com/github/codeql-action/commit/58defc0652e935f6f2ffc70a82828b98d75476fb) removes the `--external-repository-token` flag

### Workarounds

* We recommend updating to a recent version of the CodeQL runner, storing a token in your CI system's secret storage mechanism, and passing the token to the CodeQL runner using `--github-auth-stdin` or the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable.
* If still using the old flag, ensure that process output, such as from `ps`, is not persisted in CI logs.

## Passing Passwords

| November 4th, 2015  Passwords are such a pain in the ass. No matter how much you like to avoid them, you'll [always](passwords-are-here-to-stay.html) find yourself in a situation where you have to pass one to a tool in a non-interactive manner (lest you make people write expect scripts that [inject a password](https://github.com/jschauma/sshscan/blob/master/src/autopw) into anything that prints "[assword](asswords.html):" to the terminal). Doing so always carries some risk of exposure, and how to best deal with these tools is, as usual, a question best answered with "it depends". But since this is such a common problem, here are some considerations you may find worthwhile.   ---  Passwords on the command-line Example use case:  ``` cmd -p password ```  This is bad for (at least) two reasons:  * the password itself is leaked into the process table, and thus visible   to anybody running ps(1) on the system * the password is leaked into your shell's history file  Sometimes people try to be clever and store the password in an environment variable:  ``` export PASSWORD=bacon cmd -p ${PASSWORD}  ```  This doesn't solve anything. The shell still expands the command prior to invocation and leaks the password into the process table as well as your shell's history, only now the password is *also* available in the environment.  Another approach might be to store the password in a flat text file (protected by Unix permissions), and to retrieve it via backticks (`command`) or a subshell ($(command)):  ``` cmd -p `cat secret` ```  This is marginally better than specifying the password on the command-line, as it avoids leaking the password into the shell history. However, this still leaks the secret into the process table, as the shell evaluates the full command-line, finds the backticks, spawns a subshell, runs cat secret, and then replaces the whole backtick part with the result in the process table. To wit:  ``` $ sleep `echo 10` & ps x | grep [s]leep [1] 24946 24946 pts/3    S      0:00 sleep 10 ```  Now some tools try to be clever and explicitly manipulate \*\*argv when a parameter is used as a password. mysql(1) is known to do this:  ``` $ mysql -u root -p$(cat secret) >/dev/null & ps x | grep mysq[l] [1] 5554  5554 pts/0    T      0:00 mysql -u root -px xxxxx $  ```  That is, mysql(1), when parsing the command-line arguments, will explicitly overwrite the actual value of the argument passed to -p with 'x'. This leaks at the very least the length of the password into the process table (as shown above), but what people tend to overlook is that the action of manipulating \*\*argv is not (*cannot*) be atomic at program start-time. That is, there exists a race condition between the command being invoked and mysql(1) changing the value of argv[4] (in this case), and it's conceivable that an attacker might be able to observe the secret prior to it having been overwritten with 'x'.  So no good. Don't pass passwords on the command-line.   ---  Passwords via the environment Another common method of specifying a password might be by setting an environment variable:  ``` $ SECRET=$(cat secret) cmd ```  Being a smart little cookie, you shrewdly avoided leaking the secret into the process table and shell history when setting the environment variable, since the shell expands variables prior to command execution; cmd(1) was equally shrewdly written to look for the SECRET environment variable.  So far, so good. Environment variables are not generally available to other (non-root) processes. Except... well, any process with the same EUID might still be able to access e.g., /proc/pid/environ. In addition, there is still a risk of exposure to other EUID processes, as many programs happily dump their environment to stderr under certain (error) conditions, or log it via syslog(3) for debugging purposes. That is, unless you know that the application is carefully written not to do this, you might end up leaking the secret from the environment, even if you took care to prevent it from being leaked in the command invocation.  (This caveat of the application accidentally (or intentionally) logging the secret does of course apply to all cases, but it is notably easier for the application programmer to forget to scrub a specific environment variable than to not log a specific internal variable.)  See also: [Why you shouldn't use ENV variables for secret data](https://diogomonica.com/2017/03/27/why-you-shouldnt-use-env-variables-for-secret-data/).   ---  Passwords from a file As shown above, you may retrieve your password from a file (e.g., cat secret). Some applications can read a configuration file containing a password, and in many cases that is a very reasonable approach: you protect the file itself with the appropriate Unix permissions and allow the program to read it (possibly with elevated privileges).  This approach has drawbacks only in that the secret must live in the file in question in the format the application expects. Often times that means you need to have a configuration file format (json, yaml, ...) that mixes other, non-sensitive options with your password. Which, in turn, may lead to your configuration file being committed to into your revision control system, which may or may not be accessible by other parties. No good.  Another issue here is that the secret must likely exist on disk, which under certain circumstances you'd rather want to avoid. The best solution here is to allow reading a password from a file, but to not insist on a specific syntax. Instead, read the first line of data from the given file. This allows you to prepare or provide the password in a variety of ways:  *1.) From stdin or via a pipe*:  ``` $ get-secret appid | cmd -p - ```  Here, we are using the get-secret command to generate the actual secret. This is a stand-in for any key management solution you may be using, including gpg --decrypt somefile, [jass -d <somefile](http://github.com/jschauma/jass), or one of the [AWS KMS](/twitter/660482164404916225) based tools.  By using the age-old Unix convention of having a command read data from stdin when a "filename" is given as -, you can easily pipe the secret into your tool. Even if the tool was not written to suitably interpret -, you can still use this approach by way of the (now rather common) /dev/stdin device (which may or may not be a symlink to /proc/self/fd/0, for example).  *2.) From a fifo*:  ``` $ mkfifo -m 0600 /tmp/fifo $ get-secret appid > /tmp/fifo & $ cmd -p /tmp/fifo ```  This allows you to feed the the secret into the tool without leaking it to disk. The bash shell allows you to use *process substitution* in a similar manner (and may actually implement process substitution using a fifo, although you have the advantage of not having to worry about permissions on the fifo or to remove it after the fact). To wit:  ``` % bash $ cmd -p <(get-secret appid) ```  Here, <(get-secret appid) gets replaced with a short-lived fifo under /dev/fd, which cmd can then read from.  Random side-note: apparently on some systems, process substitution does not honor the user's umask, leading to a possible [information disclosure vulnerability](/twitter/662098682150592512):  ``` $ umask 0077 $ ls -l <(echo moo) prw-rw----  0 jschauma users  4 Nov  4 21:50 /dev/fd/63 $  ```  *3.) Using a here-doc or here-string*:  For example, if your shell supports *here-strings*:  ``` $ cmd -p - <<< password ```  However, note that some shells (such as bash(1)) implement *here-docs* and *here-strings* via a temporary file:  ``` $ ls -l /proc/self/fd/0 <<< whatever lr-x------ 1 jschauma users 64 Mar 10 04:15 /proc/self/fd/0 -> /tmp/sh-thd-1646882992 (deleted) ```  That is, the shell would create the temporary file, write the password to it, close it, open it again, unlink it, and then dup(1) the filedescriptor onto stdin of the command to be executed.  This, theoretically, opens up a small chance of a race condition. Later versions of bash(1), for example, appear to implement these *here-docs* and *-strings* using a pipe, eliminating this risk.  Now while this prevents the password from leaking into the process table, it unfortunately still is recorded in your shell history. That, in turn, can be avoided by using a *here-doc* instead of a *here-string*:  ``` $ cmd -p - <<EOF > password EOF $  ```  ---  Best practices So, with the above in mind, here are my recommendations:  * Either in ~/.bashrc or, better, system wide, *set a restrictive umask*   [This](/twitter/422560221450731521)   helps keep any credentials you might create in the filesystem (actual   files or fifos) protected from other users. umask 0077 is your   friend. * Either in ~/.bashrc or, better, system wide, *disable   shell history*   [This](/twitter/590333084819685378)   also helps unconsciously leaking credentials that you may have entered on   the command-line (for example via export SECRET=bacon or cmd   -p bacon, trusting cmd to not leak the password into the   process table). * If possible, at runtime *retrieve the secret from protected storage   / a [key   management service](/twitter/661364703109754880)* and feed it into the tool without any   intermediate files. This requires the tool in question to: * *Allow passing of the secret from a file.* Got a   tool that needs a password? Let it take a file arg. That allows fifo /   <(), /dev/stdin; avoids leaking into proc table/shell   history. — Jan Schaumann (@jschauma) [October 23,   2015](/twitter/657631815864295424)  Got any additional recommendations or concerns about anything I've discussed above?
