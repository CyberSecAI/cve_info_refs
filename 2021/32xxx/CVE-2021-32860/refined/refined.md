The provided content relates to CVE-2021-32860.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The iziModal library is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to unsanitized user-controlled input in the `title`, `subtitle`, and `iconText` options when creating a modal instance. Specifically, the library directly inserts these options into the HTML structure of the modal header without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Improper input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code via the `title`, `subtitle`, or `iconText` options, which will be executed in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as:
  - Stealing session cookies
  - Redirecting users to malicious sites
  - Defacing the web page
  - Performing actions on behalf of the user

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be able to influence the `title`, `subtitle` or `iconText` parameters when creating an `iziModal` instance.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to control the data passed to the `iziModal` constructor's options, specifically the `title`, `subtitle`, or `iconText` parameters.
