# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in FastAPI

Moderate

[tiangolo](/tiangolo)
published
GHSA-8h2j-cgx8-6xv7
Jun 9, 2021

## Package

pip

fastapi
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<0.65.2

## Patched versions

0.65.2

## Description

### Impact

FastAPI versions lower than `0.65.2` that used cookies for authentication in path operations that received JSON payloads sent by browsers were vulnerable to a Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attack.

In versions lower than `0.65.2`, FastAPI would try to read the request payload as JSON even if the `content-type` header sent was not set to `application/json` or a compatible JSON media type (e.g. `application/geo+json`).

So, a request with a content type of `text/plain` containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.

But requests with content type `text/plain` are exempt from [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS) preflights, for being considered [Simple requests](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple_requests). So, the browser would execute them right away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application.

### Patches

This is fixed in FastAPI `0.65.2`.

The request data is now parsed as JSON only if the `content-type` header is `application/json` or another JSON compatible media type like `application/geo+json`.

### Workarounds

It's best to upgrade to the latest FastAPI.

But still, it would be possible to add a middleware or a dependency that checks the `content-type` header and aborts the request if it is not `application/json` or another JSON compatible content type.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-917e89c036
2021-06-18 01:07:19.135408
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : python-fastapi
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 0.65.2
Release : 1.fc34
URL : <https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi>
Summary : FastAPI framework
Description :
FastAPI is a modern, fast (high-performance), web framework for building APIs
with Python 3.6+ based on standard Python type hints.

The key features are:

��� Fast: Very high performance, on par with NodeJS and Go (thanks to Starlette
and Pydantic). One of the fastest Python frameworks available.

��� Fast to code: Increase the speed to develop features by about 200% to 300%.\*
��� Fewer bugs: Reduce about 40% of human (developer) induced errors.\*
��� Intuitive: Great editor support. Completion everywhere. Less time
debugging.
��� Easy: Designed to be easy to use and learn. Less time reading docs.
��� Short: Minimize code duplication. Multiple features from each parameter
declaration. Fewer bugs.
��� Robust: Get production-ready code. With automatic interactive
documentation.
��� Standards-based: Based on (and fully compatible with) the open standards
for APIs: OpenAPI (previously known as Swagger) and JSON Schema.

\* estimation based on tests on an internal development team, building production
applications.

Update Information:

\*\*Security fixes\*\* - ���� Check Content-Type request header before assuming JSON.
Initial PR [#2118](<https://github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/pull/2118>) by
[@patrickkwang](<https://github.com/patrickkwang>). This change fixes a
[CSRF](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery>) security
vulnerability when using cookies for authentication in path operations with JSON
payloads sent by browsers. In versions lower than `0.65.2`, FastAPI would try
to read the request payload as JSON even if the `content-type` header sent was
not set to `application/json` or a compatible JSON media type (e.g.
`application/geo+json`). So, a request with a content type of `text/plain`
containing JSON data would be accepted and the JSON data would be extracted.
But requests with content type `text/plain` are exempt from
[CORS](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS>) preflights, for
being considered [Simple requests](<https://developer.mozilla.org/en->
US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS#simple\_requests). So, the browser would execute them right
away including cookies, and the text content could be a JSON string that would
be parsed and accepted by the FastAPI application. See [CVE-2021-32677](https:/
/github.com/tiangolo/fastapi/security/advisories/GHSA-8h2j-cgx8-6xv7) for more
details. Thanks to [Dima Boger](<https://twitter.com/b0g3r>) for the security
report! �������� \*\*Internal\*\* - ���� Update sponsors badge, course bundle. PR
