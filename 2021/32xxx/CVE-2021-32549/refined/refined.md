The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the `apport` package. This response focuses on **CVE-2021-32549**, which is related to an arbitrary file read vulnerability in the `openjdk-13` package hook.

**Root Cause:**

The `add_info()` function in the `package-hooks/source_openjdk-*.py` files constructs a file path using user-controlled data from the `ProcCwd` and `Pid` fields of a crash report without proper sanitization. This allows for directory traversal via symbolic links.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability exists because the `add_info()` function concatenates the `ProcCwd` and `Pid` values to form a file path without validating the path for symbolic links or ensuring that it points to a regular file.

- **Arbitrary File Read:** By controlling the `ProcCwd` and `Pid` fields, an attacker can cause the `add_info()` function to attempt to read the contents of an arbitrary file on the system by using a crafted symbolic link.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** A successful attack allows an attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files on the system that are accessible to the user running `apport`, potentially leading to sensitive data disclosure (e.g., reading `/etc/shadow` as demonstrated in the Proof of Concept).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted Crash Reports:** An attacker can create a specially crafted crash report file with malicious `ProcCwd` and `Pid` values, that when processed by `apport`, triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the system to create the malicious crash report file.
-   **Symbolic Link Creation:** The attacker needs to create a symbolic link at a known location, pointing to the target file they wish to read.
-   **Whoopsie Configuration:**  The attacker needs to configure `whoopsie` to automatically send crash reports without manual intervention.

**Additional Details:**

- This vulnerability is present in the `openjdk-13` package hook, which is used to collect information about crashes of Java applications.
- The exploit requires `fs.protected_symlinks=0` to be set for the symlink to be followed when reading a file.
- The vulnerability can be triggered when processing crash reports using the `apport` utility.
- The vulnerability is fixed in patched versions of `apport` by ensuring the path is a regular file and doesn't follow symlinks.
