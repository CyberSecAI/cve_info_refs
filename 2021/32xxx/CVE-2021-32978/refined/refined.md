The provided content is related to CVE-2021-32978.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The programming protocol allows an attacker to read a previously entered password and the lock state of the PLC.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Unprotected Storage of Credentials. The PLC stores the previously entered password in a way that is accessible to an attacker via the programming protocol.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can obtain the previously used password, allowing them to unlock the PLC. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the PLC, potentially disrupting its operation.

**Attack Vectors:** Network-based attacks. An attacker would need to be able to communicate with the PLC over the network using the programming protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be able to connect to the PLC network and use the programming protocol. No prior authentication is required to exploit this specific vulnerability.
