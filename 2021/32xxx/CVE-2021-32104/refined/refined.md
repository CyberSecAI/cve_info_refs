Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32104:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2021-32104, stating that it relates to an SQL Injection vulnerability present in OpenEMR. The content provides additional detail about the context and impact of this vulnerability.

**2. Extracted Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The primary cause is a combination of insecure API permissions, a persistent XSS vulnerability, and a command injection vulnerability which allows an attacker to leverage these vulnerabilities to reach the SQL injection vulnerability. While not directly caused by it, a lack of proper input sanitization and validation in multiple locations allow for this exploitation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Insecure API Permissions:** The Patient Portal API has insufficient authentication checks, allowing an attacker to bypass authentication by exploiting a session variable during registration.
    *   **Persistent XSS:** Unsanitized user input (specifically, the last name field) allows for the injection of malicious JavaScript code, stored in the database, and later rendered in an administrator session.
	*   **Command Injection:** The backup feature allows the execution of system commands due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input, specifically the use of backticks or `$()` in shell command construction, which allows command substitution.
    *  **SQL Injection:** Lower privileged user sessions can be misused to exploit SQL injection vulnerabilities that enable to steal patient data from the database
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution:** Attackers can achieve pre-auth command execution on the OpenEMR server by chaining vulnerabilities, leading to full system compromise.
    *   **Data Breach:** Exploiting the SQL injection vulnerabilities, attackers can steal sensitive patient data.
    *   **Infrastructure Compromise:** The command injection can lead to wider compromise of the server and potentially the entire infrastructure.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Patient Portal:** The vulnerabilities are primarily located within the Patient Portal component of OpenEMR.
    *   **Chained Exploitation:**  Attackers must first gain access through an insecure API, then inject malicious Javascript using a XSS vulnerability, then use that to exploit a Command Injection vulnerability that leads to an SQL injection and ultimately data exfiltration or system takeover.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Remote Access:** Attackers can exploit these vulnerabilities remotely over the network.
    *   **No Authentication Initially:** The attack chain begins with bypassing authentication in the Patient Portal API, followed by escalating privileges. The attacker does not initially need valid credentials, but can gain access to an administrative account by chaining the vulnerabilities and exploiting an administrator.
	*   **Knowledge of OpenEMR:** A detailed understanding of how the application works, its API's, and functionality is required in order to properly chain the vulnerabilities.
