- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Static imports within dynamically imported modules did not adhere to permission checks.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allowed dynamically imported modules to bypass network and file system permission checks when statically importing other modules.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker in control of a module within a program's module graph could:
    1. Initiate GET requests to arbitrary URLs (including LAN) and potentially read parts of the contents.
    2. Check for the existence of arbitrary paths on the file system and potentially read parts of the file contents.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability was exploitable through network and potentially file system manipulation using dynamically imported modules.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needed to control a module within the program's module graph, which could be a remote module. In versions 1.5.x and 1.6.x, the attacker module needed permissions to load dynamically; in version 1.7.x and later, the vulnerability could be exploited in a fully sandboxed isolate without any permissions.
