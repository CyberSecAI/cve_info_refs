Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-supplied input within the `widget.ejs` template. Specifically, the `kbTopicId` parameter taken from the request query is directly inserted into a JavaScript context without any encoding, leading to code injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS. This is due to the direct insertion of the `kbTopicId` parameter into the `window.knowledgebaseSettings` object in `widget.ejs` without encoding.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Encoding:** The application fails to sanitize or encode the `topicId` query parameter before using it in a Javascript context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution (Client-Side):** An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the victim's browser by crafting a malicious URL. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
    *   Defacing the website.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    *   Potentially gaining access to user data or accounts.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URL:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL with a crafted `topicId` parameter and tricks a user into clicking on the link. For example:
    *   `widgets/knowledgebase?topicId=%22-alert(1)-%22`
    *  `widgets/knowledgebase?topicId=%3C%2Fscript%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C%2Fscript%3E`
*   **Redirection:** A user can be redirected from a malicious website to the vulnerable application with a crafted URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting the crafted malicious URL, either through a link, redirection or other means.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided links in the report demonstrates the vulnerability by injecting a harmless `alert(1)` payload.
*   The vulnerability was present in the latest version of Erxes at the time of reporting.
*   The report provides a detailed timeline of coordinated disclosure efforts, highlighting the lack of response from the maintainers, before public release.
