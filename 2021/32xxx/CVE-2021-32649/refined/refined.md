Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32649:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient restrictions on methods available within the Twig templating engine in OctoberCMS. Specifically, an attacker with the ability to modify website pages could inject and execute PHP code through crafted Twig templates.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Twig Configuration:** The Twig security policy did not adequately block methods that could be abused for code execution.
*   **Insufficient Access Control:** Users with "create, modify, and delete website pages" privileges in the backend had the ability to introduce arbitrary code through Twig templates.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, leading to a complete compromise of the application and potentially the server itself.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Crafted Twig Templates:** An attacker injects malicious Twig code into website page templates via the backend interface.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Backend Access:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated session with user privileges that include the ability to "create, modify, and delete website pages" within the OctoberCMS backend.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided commit ([167b592](https://github.com/octobercms/october/commit/167b592eed291ae1563c8fcc5b9b34a03a300f26)) shows changes in `modules/cms/controllers/Themes.php` and `modules/system/twig/SecurityPolicy.php`.
    *   The changes in `SecurityPolicy.php` add more methods to the `$blockedMethods` list, indicating a mitigation of the vulnerability by restricting access to risky functions.
    *   The changes in `Themes.php` seem to enforce safe mode checks which might be related to the overall mitigation strategy.

*   The advisory mentions that the issue is fixed in versions 1.0.473 and 1.1.6.
*   The advisory does not list any CWEs.
