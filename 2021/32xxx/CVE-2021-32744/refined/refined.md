- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Predictable file identifiers (potential "IDOR" - Insecure Direct Object Reference) in the Collabora Online editor, combined with a lack of authentication required to access open files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR) - predictable file identifiers allow direct access to resources.
    - Lack of authentication or authorization checks to verify if the user is allowed to access an open file.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can gain access to files currently opened by other users in the Collabora Online editor.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker needs to know or guess the file identifier to exploit the vulnerability. The predictability of the file identifier depends on the external file-storage implementation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker does not need any authentication.
    - The attacker needs to be able to make requests to the Collabora Online server.
    - The attacker needs to know or guess a file identifier that corresponds to a currently open file.
