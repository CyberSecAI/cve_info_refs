Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32828:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `/oauth2/{serviceProviderName}/callback` REST endpoint of the Nuxeo Platform.
*   The endpoint fails to explicitly set the `Content-Type` of the HTTP response. It relies on the `Accept` header provided by the client. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code via the serviceProviderName parameter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS. The `serviceProviderName` path parameter is reflected in the response without proper sanitization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The XSS can be escalated to RCE. The attacker can inject malicious Javascript code which then makes a request to Nuxeo's automation API, specifically the `runScript` endpoint. This allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a crafted URL that injects malicious JavaScript into the `serviceProviderName` parameter of the `/oauth2/{serviceProviderName}/callback` endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in user into visiting this malicious URL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker needs a way to lure a logged-in user to click on the link.
*   The attacker can leverage the Nuxeo automation API to execute arbitrary code.
