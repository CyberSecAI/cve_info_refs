**Root Cause:**

- Nextcloud Server was sending user IDs to the lookup server even when users had no fields set to be publicly visible. This constitutes a data leak.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- Information Exposure (CWE-201): The vulnerability allows the leakage of user IDs to the lookup server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- The primary impact is the exposure of user IDs, which can be considered a privacy issue.
- Specifically, the federated cloud ID is leaked to the lookup server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is triggered by the normal operations of the Nextcloud server communicating with the lookup server.
- It is not directly user-initiated. It is a server-side leak.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- No specific attacker capabilities are required; the vulnerability lies in how Nextcloud Server communicates with the lookup server.
- An attacker would not necessarily have direct access to the Nextcloud instance but would be able to observe the communication between the Nextcloud Server and the lookup server.

**Summary of the information:**

The provided information details that Nextcloud Server versions prior to 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2 were leaking user IDs to the lookup server, even when the users had not set any fields to be publicly published. This leak is considered low severity. The vulnerability is addressed in the patched versions 19.0.11, 20.0.10, and 21.0.2.
