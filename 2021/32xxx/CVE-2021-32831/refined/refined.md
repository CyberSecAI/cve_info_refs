{
  "CVE-2021-32831": {
    "Root cause": "The `utils.set` function in Total.js allows code injection due to insufficient sanitization of user-controlled input.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Code Injection"
    ],
    "Impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the Node.js application, potentially leading to denial of service (DoS) or remote code execution (RCE).",
    "Attack vectors": "By calling the `utils.set` function with malicious user-controlled values.",
     "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker must be able to control the arguments passed to the `utils.set` function. This likely requires some form of access to application logic that uses this function, or direct access to the vulnerable function call.",
    "Additional Details": "The provided proof-of-concept code demonstrates both a denial-of-service (infinite loop) and remote code execution (file creation). The vulnerability exists because the path passed to `utils.set` is not properly sanitized. The fix involves adding a check for potentially dangerous characters in the path, as well as improving the sanitization of the generated javascript code."
