        "vulnerability": "The vulnerability is an Open Redirect in the `oidc_validate_redirect_url()` function. It occurs because this function doesn't parse URLs the same way as most browsers, allowing it to be bypassed (e.g., with `https://a.com@b.com/`), leading to an Open Redirect vulnerability in the logout functionality. The fix replaces backslashes with slashes in the redirect URL. A workaround is to configure `mod_auth_openidc` to only allow redirection destinations matching a given regular expression.",
