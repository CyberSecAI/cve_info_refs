[`7e32516`](/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/commit/7e32516a211b9d13433fc5a6016642e3ad2fc974)

This is a important hot-fix release to fix an issue where the room upgrade handling would not verify that the new room

was a predecessor of the old room. All bridges making use of the room upgrade handling feature should update.

## Bugfixes

* Fix an issue where the room upgrade handler would not check the `m.room.create` event when traversing an upgrade. ([#330](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/issues/330))

# Automatic room upgrade handling can be used maliciously to bridge a room non-consentually

Moderate

[Half-Shot](/Half-Shot)
published
GHSA-35g4-qx3c-vjhx
Jun 16, 2021

## Package

npm

matrix-appservice-bridge
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<=2.6.0

## Patched versions

2.6.1

## Description

### Impact

If a bridge has room upgrade handling turned on in the configuration (the `roomUpgradeOpts` key when instantiating a new `Bridge` instance.), any `m.room.tombstone` event it encounters will be used to unbridge the current room and bridge into the target room. However, the target room `m.room.create` event is not checked to verify if the `predecessor` field contains the previous room. This means that any mailcious admin of a bridged room can repoint the traffic to a different room without the new room being aware.

### Patches

Versions 2.6.1 and greater are patched.

### Workarounds

Disabling the automatic room upgrade handling can be done by removing the `roomUpgradeOpts` key from the `Bridge` class options.

### References

The issue is patched by [#330](https://github.com/matrix-org/matrix-appservice-bridge/pull/330)

### For more information]

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, email us at security@matrix.org.

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-32659

### Weaknesses

No CWEs
