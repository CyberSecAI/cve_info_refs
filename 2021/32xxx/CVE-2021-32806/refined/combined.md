# URL Redirection to Untrusted Site ('Open Redirect') in Products.isurlinportal

Low

[mauritsvanrees](/mauritsvanrees)
published
GHSA-q3m9-9fj2-mfwr
Jul 31, 2021

## Package

pip

Products.isurlinportal
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 1.2.0

## Patched versions

1.2.0

## Description

### Impact

Various parts of Plone use the 'is url in portal' check for security, mostly to see if it is safe to redirect to a url. A url like `https://example.org` is not in the portal.

But the url `https:example.org` without slashes tricks our code and it *is* considered to be in the portal.

When redirecting, some browsers go to `https://example.org`, others give an error.

Attackers may use this to redirect you to their site, especially as part of a phishing attack.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in `Products.isurlinportal` 1.2.0.

This is a recommended upgrade for all users of Plone 4.3 and 5, on Python 2.7 or higher.

It has not been tested on earlier Plone or Python versions.

Upcoming Plone 5.2.5 and higher will include the new version.

### Discovered

This vulnerability was discovered and reported by Yuji Tounai of Mitsui Bussan Secure Directions, Inc. Thank you!
