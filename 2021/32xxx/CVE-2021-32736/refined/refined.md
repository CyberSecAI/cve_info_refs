Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32736

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The software `think-helper` does not properly control modifications of object prototype attributes. Specifically, it receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes which are then used to initialize or update an object, but without adequate validation or sanitization. This allows an attacker to manipulate the object's prototype.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Prototype Pollution (CWE-1321)

**Impact of exploitation:** By modifying the object prototype, an attacker can potentially:
  - Inject malicious properties or methods into all objects that inherit from the affected prototype.
  - Cause denial-of-service by overwriting critical prototype properties, leading to unexpected behavior or application crashes.
  -  Potentially achieve Remote Code Execution if the application utilizes the polluted prototype properties in an unsafe way.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by providing specially crafted input to the `think-helper` package. The input specifies the attributes that will be initialized or updated.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to have the ability to supply malicious input to the vulnerable `think-helper` component, which can be through user-controlled parameters, configuration files, or other data sources.

**Additional Details:**

The advisory explicitly mentions that the vulnerability has a "High" severity rating. It also credits `yoshino-s` for the vulnerability analysis. The vulnerability is fixed in version `1.1.3`.
