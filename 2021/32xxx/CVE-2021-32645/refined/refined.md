{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The application was vulnerable to open redirects due to insufficient sanitization of user-provided URLs when the default Hostname Identification was used, and tenants had `force_https` set to `true`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Open redirect vulnerability."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could craft a special URL, and when a user clicks it they will be redirected from the legitimate site to a malicious site. This can be used for phishing or distributing malware.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability can be exploited through specially crafted URLs.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and convince a user to click them, which can be done by using email, social media, or similar channels."
  },
  "cve": "CVE-2021-32645",
  "additional_info": "The vulnerability is specific to installations using the default Hostname Identification and where tenants have `force_https` set to true. The fix involves stripping special characters from the URL to prevent malicious redirects. A workaround is setting `force_https` to `false` for every tenant. The CVSS score is 4.3 (Moderate), with the attack vector being network, low attack complexity, no privileges required, user interaction required, unchanged scope, no confidentiality impact, low integrity impact, and no availability impact."
