Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-32029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how PostgreSQL handles `UPDATE ... RETURNING` commands on purpose-crafted partitioned tables.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  A memory disclosure vulnerability exists when using an `UPDATE ... RETURNING` command on a specially crafted partitioned table.
  - Authenticated database users can read arbitrary bytes of server memory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The main impact is the disclosure of sensitive server memory, potentially exposing confidential data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a malicious SQL query (`UPDATE ... RETURNING`) executed on a specially crafted partitioned table.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated database user to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   An attacker needs to be an authenticated database user.
 -  By default, any authenticated database user can create the objects needed to complete this attack unless specific privileges are restricted.
    - Specifically, users lacking `CREATE` and `TEMPORARY` privileges on all databases and the `CREATE` privilege on all schemas are typically not able to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in PostgreSQL versions 13.3, 12.7, and 11.12.
- Red Hat has issued security advisories (RHSA-2021:2372, RHSA-2021:2375, RHSA-2021:2389, RHSA-2021:2394, RHSA-2021:2396) addressing this vulnerability in various products like Red Hat Enterprise Linux and Red Hat Software Collections.
