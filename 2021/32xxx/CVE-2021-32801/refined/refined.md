Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32801:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Exceptions logged by the Nextcloud server might inadvertently include sensitive key material used for Encryption-at-Rest functionality. This occurs because certain functions with sensitive parameters were not properly sanitized before being included in the error logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:**  The vulnerability stems from the lack of sanitization of sensitive parameters before they are logged, leading to potential exposure of encryption keys.
- **Logging of Sensitive Data:** The core issue is the logging of encryption-at-rest keys within exception messages.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Exposure of Encryption Keys:** An attacker gaining access to the server's logs could potentially obtain the encryption keys used for the Encryption-at-Rest functionality.
- **Data Breach:** With access to the encryption keys, an attacker could decrypt sensitive data stored within the Nextcloud instance.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Log Access:** The primary attack vector is gaining access to the Nextcloud server logs. This could occur via:
    - Unauthorized access to the server file system.
    - Exploitation of other vulnerabilities that grant access to server logs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to read the server's log files. This may require:
    - Local file system access to the server.
    - Exploitation of another vulnerability leading to log file access.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered **low severity**
- The issue is specific to instances that utilize Nextcloud's Encryption-at-Rest feature. If this feature is not used, the instance is not affected by this bug.
- The fix involves sanitizing function parameters that handle sensitive information before they are logged.
- Patched versions include Nextcloud Server versions 20.0.12, 21.0.4 and 22.1.0.
- A workaround is to disable logging, but the recommended solution is to upgrade.
- The vulnerability was tracked on HackerOne and a related Pull Request on Github is linked.
- The fix was backported to stable versions 20, 21, and 22.
