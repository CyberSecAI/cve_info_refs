Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-32923:

**Root Cause:**
- A flaw in Vault's lease renewal logic. Specifically, when a token lease or dynamic secret lease was renewed within the last second of its maximum Time-To-Live (TTL), the renewed lease was assigned a TTL of 0 seconds (rounded down) which was then incorrectly treated as non-expiring.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Incorrect handling of lease renewals near the maximum TTL.
- Failure to properly expire leases, leading to tokens and dynamic secrets persisting beyond their intended lifetime.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Token Leases:**  Tokens renewed with the described flaw were considered invalid by Vault and thus not posing an immediate security risk since they would not be accepted for authentication.
- **Dynamic Secrets:** Dynamic secrets renewed with the flaw remained valid past their intended lifespan and could be accepted by the underlying service, potentially leading to unauthorized access or other issues related to compromised secrets.

**Attack Vectors:**
-  Lease renewal requests within the last second of the maximum TTL, typically triggered via automated renewal processes operating under tight time constraints. An existing Vault token is needed to trigger the exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need a valid Vault token to trigger the renewal of a lease. They do not necessarily need to be an external attacker, but could be an internal actor or an automated process using a token.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability was addressed in Vault versions 1.5.9, 1.6.5, and 1.7.2.
-  Upgrading to these versions or newer will automatically expire any existing token and dynamic secret leases that are non-expiring because of this flaw.
-  Scripts are provided to identify tokens/leases affected by this issue if manual identification before upgrading is needed.
