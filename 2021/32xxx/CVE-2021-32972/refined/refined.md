Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (CWE-611). The Panasonic FPWIN Pro software's XML parser processes a specially crafted project file that specifies a URI.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The software improperly restricts the use of external entities in XML processing. This allows a crafted XML document to specify URIs to external resources.

**Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit allows a remote attacker to retrieve sensitive information from the file system where the affected software is installed. This is because the XML parser accesses the specified URI and embeds the content into the document, thus potentially disclosing information accessible to the user running the software.

**Attack Vectors:** A specially crafted project file is used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to provide a malicious project file to the user. The attacker can be local but needs the user to open the crafted file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in all versions of FPWIN Pro programming control software, version 7.5.1.1 and prior.
*   A CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 has been calculated with the vector string: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N.
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*   A patch (FPWIN Pro v7.5.2.0) has been released to address the vulnerability.
