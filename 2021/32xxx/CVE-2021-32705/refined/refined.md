Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-32705:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a **lack of rate limiting** on the public WebDAV endpoint in Nextcloud.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Missing Rate Limiting:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper rate limiting mechanisms for the public DAV endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Enumeration of Share Tokens/Credentials:** An attacker could exploit this by making numerous requests to potentially enumerate valid share tokens or user credentials. This could lead to unauthorized access to shared files/folders.
*  **Potential Denial of Service:** Although not the primary impact described, the Gentoo advisory mentions that the worst of the vulnerabilities found in Nextcloud could result in a denial of service, which could be achieved through unthrottled requests to the public DAV endpoint.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Public DAV Endpoint:** The attack vector is the public WebDAV endpoint of a Nextcloud server. This endpoint is accessible over the network.
*   **Repeated Requests:** The attacker would send repeated requests to the public DAV endpoint, exploiting the missing rate limit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs network access to the Nextcloud server to make requests to the public DAV endpoint.
*   **No Authentication Required Initially:** The attacker does not need to be authenticated initially to exploit this vulnerability. The requests are made to a public endpoint.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Nextcloud versions prior to 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3 were affected.
*   **Fix:** The vulnerability was fixed by implementing rate limiting on the public DAV endpoint in the mentioned versions.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is rated as low severity.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is associated with CWE-799 (Missing Rate Limiting).
*   **Mitigation:** Upgrading Nextcloud to a patched version is the recommended solution. There are no known workarounds.

The information in the provided content is more detailed than the basic CVE description. It includes references to the patch and the root cause of missing rate limiting along with details about how an attacker can exploit the vulnerability by making repeated requests to the public DAV endpoint.
