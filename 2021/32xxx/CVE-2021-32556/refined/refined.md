```
Root cause of vulnerability:
The `get_modified_conffiles()` function in `backends/packaging-apt-dpkg.py` does not properly sanitize the package name argument passed to `dpkg-query`, allowing for command injection.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Command injection vulnerability in the `get_modified_conffiles()` function.

Impact of exploitation:
An attacker can manipulate the output of `dpkg-query` to include arbitrary files (e.g., `/etc/shadow`) in the crash report, potentially leading to information disclosure.

Attack vectors:
An attacker can provide a specially crafted package name to the `get_modified_conffiles()` function.

Required attacker capabilities/position:
The attacker needs to be able to influence the package name provided to the `get_modified_conffiles()` function.
