Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32813:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from Traefik's improper handling of the `Connection` header. Traefik was not removing hop-by-hop headers specified in the `Connection` header before passing the request to backend services or other middlewares.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Header Removal Vulnerability**: Traefik failed to remove headers listed in the `Connection` header before forwarding the request. This means that a client could specify headers in the `Connection` header, and Traefik would remove those specified headers from the request before forwarding it.
- The `Connection` header is intended to specify options that apply only to the immediate connection, not to end-to-end communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Header Manipulation**: An attacker could use this vulnerability to manipulate or drop specific headers in a request.
- **Potential Privilege Escalation**: Although unlikely, if the dropped header was a required security header, this could potentially lead to a privilege escalation, as backend services may not receive expected security information.
- **Bypass Security Checks**: If the dropped headers are required by backend services for security checks or access control, the attacker could potentially bypass those checks.
- **Denial of Service**: By removing critical headers, the attacker could cause a denial of service due to incorrect routing or error handling on backend services.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a specially crafted HTTP request containing a malicious `Connection` header.
- The attacker needs to send a request to a Traefik instance that has a chain of middlewares configured and have access to set a custom header.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a Traefik instance.
- The attacker must be able to control the headers of the HTTP request, especially the `Connection` header.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in Traefik version 2.4.13.
- The fix involves the introduction of a `connectionheader` middleware that correctly removes the hop-by-hop headers specified in the `Connection` header.
- The vulnerability affects Traefik versions prior to 2.4.13 and v1.7.30.
