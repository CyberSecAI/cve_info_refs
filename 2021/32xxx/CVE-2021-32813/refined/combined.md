# Drop Headers via Malicious Connection Header

Low

[emilevauge](/emilevauge)
published
GHSA-m697-4v8f-55qg
Aug 3, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<2.4.13, <=v1.7.30

## Patched versions

2.4.13

## Description

# Impact

There exists a potential header vulnerability in Traefik's handling of the Connection header. Active exploitation of this issue is unlikely, as it requires that a removed header would lead to a privilege escalation, however, the Traefik team has addressed this issue to prevent any potential abuse.

# Details

If you have a chain of Traefik middlewares, and one of them sets a request header `Important-Security-Header`, then sending a request with the following Connection header will cause it to be removed before the request was sent:

```
curl 'https://example.com' -H "Connection: Important-Security-Header" -0

```

In this case, the backend does not see the request header `Important-Security-Header`.

# Patches

Traefik v2.4.x: <https://github.com/traefik/traefik/releases/tag/v2.4.13>

# Workarounds

No.

# For more information
