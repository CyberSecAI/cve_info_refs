Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32631:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the improper verification of JSON Web Token (JWT) signatures. The `parse` method was used instead of the `parseClaimsJws` method when validating the JWT, which does not verify the signature.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper JWT signature verification
- Use of `parse` method instead of `parseClaimsJws`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows an attacker to forge valid JWTs.
- Potential for authentication bypasses.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker could forge a JWT with arbitrary claims.
- The forged token can then be used to gain unauthorized access by bypassing authentication mechanisms.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a JWT.
- No specific position within the infrastructure is mentioned, the attacker just needs to be able to submit a crafted JWT to the vulnerable system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the `nimble-platform/common` repository before commit `3b96cb0`.
- The fix is introduced in commits `12197a7` and `a59ad46`, which change the method used for JWT parsing from `parse` to `parseClaimsJws`.
- The vulnerable code was located in `utility/src/main/java/eu/nimble/utility/validation/ValidationUtil.java`.
- The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate".
- The official advisory is available at: `https://github.com/nimble-platform/common/security/advisories/GHSA-fjq8-896w-pv28`
