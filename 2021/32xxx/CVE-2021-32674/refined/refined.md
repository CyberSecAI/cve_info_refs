{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the ability to traverse and access unauthorized Python modules indirectly through allowed modules within Template Attribute Language (TAL) expressions in Zope Page Templates.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Indirect access to restricted modules via allowed modules in TAL expressions",
      "Insufficient restrictions on module traversal in TAL expressions"
    ],
    "impact": "Remote Code Execution. By exploiting this vulnerability, attackers can gain unauthorized access to server resources and potentially execute arbitrary code on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves crafting malicious TAL expressions within Zope Page Templates that allow traversal to and execution of restricted Python modules.",
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs the ability to add or edit Zope Page Templates through the web, typically requiring the 'Manager' role in Zope. This attack is only feasible if untrusted users have the ability to modify Zope Page Templates."
  },
  "fixes": [
    "The problem has been fixed in Zope versions 5.2.1 and 4.6.1",
    "Restrict adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web using Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing Zope Page Templates through the web should be restricted to trusted users only."
  ],
  "cve_id": "CVE-2021-32674"
