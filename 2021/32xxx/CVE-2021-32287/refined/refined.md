The provided content describes a global buffer overflow vulnerability in the `hevcdecoderconfigrecord.cpp` file of the `nokiatech/heif` repository, specifically at line 311.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A global buffer overflow occurs when the `getPicWidth()` method attempts to read data beyond the bounds of the allocated memory. Specifically, it reads 2 bytes from an address that is 30 bytes to the right of a global variable `subWidthC`, and 26 bytes to the left of `subHeightC`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The core weakness is an out-of-bounds read, leading to a global buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can cause a program crash, as evidenced by the AddressSanitizer output showing an error and subsequent abort. It is also possible that an attacker could leverage this to achieve arbitrary code execution, though this is not demonstrated here.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted HEIF file. The specific steps to reproduce involve compiling the `example.cpp` file with AddressSanitizer flags, modifying the example to use example7() for filename input, and then running the compiled binary against the malicious HEIF file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted HEIF file to the vulnerable application.

The issue was fixed in commit `b26a708`.
