The provided content is related to CVE-2021-32961.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the unrestricted upload of a file with a dangerous type. Specifically, the `getfile` function allows an optional parameter, causing it to process requests in a special way which can lead to the execution of an unzip command, placing a malicious .exe file in a location where it can be executed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted upload of file with dangerous type (CWE-434).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the target system.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can supply a crafted request to the `getfile` function with a malicious file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system and an understanding of the `getfile` function's optional parameter. No user authentication is required (PR:N).
