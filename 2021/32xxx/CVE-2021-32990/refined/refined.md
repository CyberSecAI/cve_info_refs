*   The attack complexity is low
*   The exploit requires user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker requires local access to the system where FATEK Automation WinProladder is installed, and needs to convince a user to open a malicious project file with the program.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The advisory mentions that no public exploits are known.
*   FATEK Automation is working on a solution.
*   The affected software is used in the Critical Manufacturing sector, and is deployed worldwide.
*   The advisory also gives general mitigation advice, such as network segmentation, using firewalls, and using VPNs for remote access.
