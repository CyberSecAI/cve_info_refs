Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-32986:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The PLC remains unlocked after an authorized user unlocks it, even if the programming software is interrupted. This is due to the lack of a timeout mechanism for the unlocked state.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass Using an Alternate Path or Channel (CWE-288):**  The PLC remains in an unlocked state indefinitely if the programming software disconnects incorrectly. This allows any subsequent programming connection to bypass authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can connect to the PLC without authorization while it remains unlocked.
*   Full read/write access to the PLC can be obtained by an attacker until the PLC is power cycled or the software disconnects correctly.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based attacks: An attacker with network access to the PLC can exploit this vulnerability if an authorized user unlocks the device but disconnects improperly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Network access to the PLC
*   No prior authentication is necessary after a PLC has been unlocked by an authorized user, then the programming software is interrupted and disconnects improperly.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Automation Direct CLICK PLC CPU Modules C0-1x CPUs with firmware versions prior to v3.00.
*   The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), indicating critical severity.
*   The issue can be resolved by updating the PLC firmware to version 3.00 or later.
