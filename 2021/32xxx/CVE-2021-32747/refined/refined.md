Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-32747:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Icinga Web 2 handles custom variables when accessed through specific undocumented URL parameters.  Protection rules and blacklists defined for custom variables are not applied when these variables are accessed using the `addColumns` parameter in the following routes:
*   `/icingaweb2/monitoring/list/hosts`
*   `/icingaweb2/monitoring/list/services`

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Input Validation:** The application fails to properly validate and sanitize user-supplied URL parameters, specifically the `addColumns` parameter, allowing it to bypass access control mechanisms.
*   **Bypass of Security Controls:** Custom variable protection rules and blacklists configured in user roles are circumvented when accessing variables through the vulnerable URL parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can access sensitive custom variables, such as secrets used for authentication, even if those variables should be protected or hidden. This can lead to the exposure of critical system information.
*   **Data Exposure:** Exporting data to JSON or CSV formats also exposes these custom variables, potentially leading to further data leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Manipulation:** Attackers can directly craft URLs with the `addColumns` parameter to expose custom variables in host and service lists.
*   **Data Export:** The vulnerability can also be exploited when exporting data in JSON or CSV formats.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user of Icinga Web 2.
*   **Access to Hosts/Services:** The attacker must have access to the hosts or services for which they are trying to expose custom variables.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable `addColumns` parameter and how to use it.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects Icinga Web 2 versions 2.0.0 to 2.8.2.
*   Patches are available in versions 2.7.5, 2.8.3, and 2.9.0.
*   A workaround is suggested by restricting access to hosts/services with the custom variable in question.
