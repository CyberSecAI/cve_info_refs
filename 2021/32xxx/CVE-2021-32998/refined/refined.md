- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The affected products are vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to remotely execute arbitrary code on the affected device. This requires an INIT START/restore from backup to remediate.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need network access to the affected device, but does not require any authentication or user interaction. The attack complexity is considered high.
