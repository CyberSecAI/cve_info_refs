**Bulletin ID:** HCSEC-2021-13

**Affected Products / Versions:** vault-action 0.1.0 through 2.1.2; fixed in 2.2.0.

**Publication Date:** May 6, 2021

**Summary**

The Vault GitHub Action, vault-action or vault-secrets (“vault-action”), did not correctly mask multi-line secrets in its output. This vulnerability, CVE-2021-32074, was fixed in vault-action 2.2.0.

**Background**

The Vault GitHub Action, vault-action (<https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vault-secrets>, <https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-action>), simplifies using HashiCorp Vault secrets as GitHub Actions variables.

By default, vault-action automatically marks all Vault secrets imported into GitHub Actions variables as secret, which causes GitHub Actions to mask them when included in output.

**Details**

The vault-action implementation did not correctly handle the marking of multi-line variables. As a result, multi-line secrets were not correctly masked in vault-action output.

*Note that this is not a vulnerability in HashiCorp Vault or Vault Enterprise, but is specific to the Vault GitHub Action as described above.*

**Remediation**

Customers using vault-action should evaluate the risk associated with this issue, and consider upgrading to vault-action 2.2.0 or newer. Please refer to <https://github.com/marketplace/actions/vault-secrets> for more information.

**Acknowledgement**

This issue was identified by an external party who reported it to HashiCorp.

*We deeply appreciate any effort to coordinate disclosure of security vulnerabilities. For information about security at HashiCorp and the reporting of security vulnerabilities, please see <https://hashicorp.com/security>.*

### @tomhjp **[tomhjp](/tomhjp)** commented [Apr 30, 2021](#issue-872718680) • edited Loading

Closes [#205](https://github.com/hashicorp/vault-action/issues/205).

When fetching multi-line secrets from Vault, the secret was not being properly registered with GH actions for masking in the output logs. See the linked issue for full details - the fix itself is fairly trivial.

Still todo:

* Run some real infrastructure tests to confirm the fix
* ~~[ ] Determine whether the large `index.js` diff is problematic, looks like I probably have some different local versions installed to the previous builder~~

Sorry, something went wrong.

LGTM, but [@tvoran](https://github.com/tvoran) is right, please remove the compiled `index.js` changes and we'll do that when we're ready to release.
