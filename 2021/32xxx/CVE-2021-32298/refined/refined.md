The provided content is related to CVE-2021-32298.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A global-buffer-overflow occurs in the `IFF_errorId` function in `error.c` at line 46, column 18, due to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Global buffer overflow. The code attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Program crash due to the AddressSanitizer detecting a global-buffer-overflow.
- Potential for further exploitation if the crash were bypassed, possibly leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Processing a crafted IFF file that triggers the overflow in `IFF_errorId`.
- Specifically, the overflow is triggered when reading an invalid ID in the IFF file format.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted IFF file that will cause the `IFF_errorId` function to read out of bounds.
- No specific user privileges are needed to trigger the vulnerability, only the ability to provide the malicious IFF file to the application processing it.
