| The code style changes are embedded by purpose, make things more readable and didn't want to create a PR with those themself only. The changes to fix the shell injection have already have been discussed by mail already and are easy to identify in the first commit. So please don't be too pedantic with "security only" here... :-)  [6832ed1](https://github.com/websvnphp/websvn/commit/6832ed139134dc85deb0f15e370c8b0ae9aacf7a) |
