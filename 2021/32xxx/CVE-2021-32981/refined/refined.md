Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an improper limitation of a pathname to a restricted directory, also known as a path traversal vulnerability. The software uses external input to construct a pathname for a file or directory within a restricted area, but it doesn't properly handle special elements in the path that can lead to locations outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CWE-22: Path Traversal. The software fails to neutralize special elements within the pathname, allowing the path to resolve to a location outside the intended restricted directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow a malicious entity to achieve arbitrary code execution with system privileges or cause a denial-of-service condition. Specifically, a successful path traversal attack could allow an attacker to access or overwrite files outside of the intended directory. This is part of a chain of vulnerabilities that allow arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network (AV:N), with low attack complexity (AC:L)
- An attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) to exploit this specific vulnerability.
- No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to be on the adjacent network and have a high level of access/privilege to exploit this path traversal vulnerability. This is one of several vulnerabilities that can be chained to achieve remote code execution.

**Additional Information:**
The provided documents also mention other related vulnerabilities in AVEVA System Platform:
- CWE-306: Missing Authentication for Critical Function (CVE-2021-33008)
- CWE-248: Uncaught Exception (CVE-2021-33010)
- CWE-346: Origin Validation Error (CVE-2021-32985)
- CWE-347: Improper Verification of Digital Signature (CVE-2021-32977)
These vulnerabilities can be chained together with the path traversal vulnerability to achieve arbitrary code execution or denial-of-service.
