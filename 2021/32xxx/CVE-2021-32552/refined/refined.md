The provided content contains detailed information about multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-32552.

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2021-32552

**Root Cause:** The `add_info()` function in `package-hooks/source_openjdk-*.py` constructs a file path using user-controlled data (`ProcCwd` and `Pid`) without proper sanitization, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Directory Traversal:** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to specify a path using `ProcCwd` and `Pid` that can traverse directories, potentially reaching outside of the intended location.
*  **Arbitrary File Read:** By controlling the path, an attacker can cause the function to read the contents of arbitrary files on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read sensitive files, such as `/etc/shadow`, leading to the disclosure of system secrets.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   A crafted crash report containing a malicious `ProcCwd` and `Pid` values can be used to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to create a crash report with the malicious values.
*   The attacker must have the ability to create a symbolic link, to achieve the arbitrary file read.
*   The attacker must be able to trigger the apport crash handling mechanism.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `add_info` function of the `package-hooks/source_openjdk-*.py` script within the `apport` package.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by injecting a crafted `ProcCwd` and `Pid` into a crash report.
*   The `read_file()` function within `apport/hookutils.py` does not check if the file is a symlink or FIFO.
*   The fix involves ensuring the file path is not a symlink or FIFO in `read_file()` function.
