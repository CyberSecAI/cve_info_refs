Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32847:

**Root Cause:**
A typo in the `pci_vtblk_proc` function within the Hyperkit's virtio-block driver resulted in an assignment (`=`) instead of a comparison (`==`) within an assertion. This caused the size check on the incoming `iov` data structure to be ineffective.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect Assertion:** The assertion `assert(iov[1].iov_len = sizeof(struct virtio_blk_discard_write_zeroes));` was intended to verify the size of the payload descriptor for the `VBH_OP_DISCARD` operation. However, the use of `=` instead of `==` turned the assertion into an assignment that always evaluates to true, allowing the code to proceed with an invalid `iov_len`.
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** This invalid `iov_len` allowed a guest to manipulate the `iov_base` pointer to read data from outside the guest's allocated memory space.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Host Memory Disclosure:** A malicious guest can trigger the vulnerability to read host memory. This information leakage can potentially expose sensitive data residing in the host's memory space.
- **Information Oracle:** By carefully manipulating the disk image, a malicious guest can use the vulnerability as an oracle. By controlling the `num_sectors` field of the `virtio_blk_discard_write_zeroes` structure, the guest can read arbitrary host memory by controlling the amount of data to be overwritten by the `DISCARD` operation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Guest:** The attacker must have control over a virtualized guest operating system running within the Hyperkit environment.
- **Virtio-Block Driver:** The attack targets the virtio-block driver implementation in Hyperkit.
- **VBH_OP_DISCARD Operation:** The exploit is triggered by sending a crafted `VBH_OP_DISCARD` request to the virtio-block device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Guest Execution:** The attacker must be able to execute code within the guest operating system.
- **Virtio Device Interaction:** The attacker needs to interact with the virtio-block device interface to send specially crafted requests that exploit the flawed assertion.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found by GHSL team member @agustingianni.
- The vulnerability is present in version v0.20210107 of Hyperkit.
- The vulnerability was fixed on 2021-09-14.
- The vulnerability can be detected using AddressSanitizer when compiling hyperkit.
- The guest memory is allocated in the `MALLOC_LARGE` zone, right before `MALLOC_TINY`, which is prone to heap manipulation from the guest. This makes exploitation easier for a guest with heap manipulation capabilities.
- The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) demonstrates how a guest can send a `VBH_OP_DISCARD` request with a crafted `iov_base` to read host memory.
