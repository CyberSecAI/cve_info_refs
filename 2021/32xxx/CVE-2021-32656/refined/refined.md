Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32656:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the way Nextcloud handles the exchange of user information between servers when federated shares are created.  Specifically, if the "Add server automatically once a federated share was created successfully" setting is enabled, an attacker can trigger this exchange using a public link that they have access to.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption/Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to initiate a server information exchange by leveraging a public link.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By triggering this exchange, the attacker can gain access to basic user information from the target Nextcloud server.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is a **public link** that is added as a federated share, and the attacker needs access to such a link.
*   The attacker triggers a federated share creation that results in the target server initiating a server information exchange

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs access to a public link that can be added as a federated share on the target Nextcloud instance.
*   The "Add server automatically..." setting must be enabled on the targeted Nextcloud instance.

**Additional Notes**
* The advisory from Github provides more context and details on the attack vector and affected configurations. The Gentoo advisory provides a list of CVEs affecting the Nextcloud package.
