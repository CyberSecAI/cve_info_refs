Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control, allowing authenticated admin users to access arbitrary files on the server.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Improper Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper restriction on file access. This allows an authenticated administrator to bypass intended access limitations.
*   **CWE-552:** The identified CWE (CWE-552) refers to "Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties," which directly aligns with the vulnerability description.

**Impact:**
*   **Arbitrary File Access:** A malicious admin user can read any file on the server, potentially leading to information disclosure, exposure of sensitive data, and other unauthorized actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Authenticated Admin User:** The attack vector requires an attacker to have compromised admin credentials for the affected system. This is not an anonymous access issue, but requires a privileged user account.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker must have administrative privileges within the application. This means they need to have a valid admin account.

**Summary:**
The vulnerability allows an authenticated admin user to bypass access restrictions and read any file on the server, due to the weakness described by CWE-552. This is a high severity issue because it exposes sensitive data that may lead to further compromise.
