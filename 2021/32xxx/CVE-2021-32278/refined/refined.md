Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32278

**Root Cause:**
*   The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow located in `lt_predict.c:108:36`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:**  The code attempts to write data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By crafting a malicious audio file, an attacker can trigger the heap-buffer-overflow, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. This allows the attacker to take control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious Audio File:** The primary attack vector is providing a crafted audio file to the faad2 decoder. When the decoder processes this file, it will trigger the buffer overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted audio file that triggers the overflow in the `lt_predict.c` function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided github link references a specific commit `e19a5e4` that fixes the heap-buffer-overflow.
*   The vulnerability is present in faad2, a freeware Advanced Audio Decoder.
*   The vulnerability is related to how the `lt_prediction` function processes audio data.
*   The AddressSanitizer output details the location of the overflow and its surrounding memory.
