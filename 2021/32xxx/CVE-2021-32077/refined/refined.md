Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The MSOW Solutions software, specifically its Primary Source Verification (PSV) search module, allowed unauthenticated users to query employee records using personally identifiable information (PII) such as last names.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The system inadvertently allowed malicious users to enumerate employee records by last name.
*   **Predictable Data:** The last four digits of a Social Security Number (SSN) are the serial number. With other information like date of birth, first and last name, the serial number is the only unpredictable portion of the SSN which can be brute-forced.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The system did not properly restrict queries, allowing for broad searches that could be used to obtain a large number of employee records.
*   **Lack of Rate Limiting:** The system appears to have lacked proper rate limiting, allowing for automated tools to be used to make a large number of queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SSN Exposure:** Attackers could use the discovered employee last names to target the serial number portion of an SSN via brute force attacks.
*   **Potential for Fraud:** The last four digits of an SSN, when combined with other personal information, can be used for various fraudulent activities, including applying for loans, accessing healthcare, social engineering attacks, and identity theft.
*   **Privacy Violation:** The unauthorized access and disclosure of personal information constitute a privacy violation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Internet Access:** The vulnerable component was an internet-facing module of the MSOW software accessible to anyone.
*   **Automated Fuzzing Tools:** Attackers could use automated tools to submit queries and guess the social security serial numbers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Basic Internet Access:** The attacker simply needs access to the internet to reach the vulnerable website.
*   **Technical Knowledge:** The attacker needs some understanding of how SSNs are structured and how to use automated tools for making queries and brute-forcing.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability was discovered during a security review of a credentialing website.
*   The affected software is MSOW Solutions, provided by VerityStream (now part of HealthStream).
*   The vulnerability allowed for the discovery of the serial numbers which are the last four digits of an SSN.
*   The vendor was slow to notify customers of the patch.
*   The vulnerability was patched on April 29, 2021.
