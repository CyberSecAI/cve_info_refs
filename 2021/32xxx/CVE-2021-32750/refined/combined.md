# De-anonymization via message

High

GHSA-68xh-9h7w-64qg
Jul 15, 2021

## Package

MuWire desktop client

## Affected versions

< 0.8.8

## Patched versions

0.8.8

## Description

### Impact

Users of MuWire desktop client can be de-anonymized by an attacker who knows their full id.

### Patches

Problem is fixed in MuWire 0.8.8

### Workarounds

Users can disable messaging functionality and will be safe.

### Description

Input from network was not being sanitized for HTML entities. An attacker could send a message with a subject like:

```
<html><img src="https://my.tracking.server.com"/></html>

```

and the MuWire would try to fetch that image via clearnet, thus exposing the IP address of the user.
