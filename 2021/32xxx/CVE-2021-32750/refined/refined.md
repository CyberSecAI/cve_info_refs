- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The MuWire desktop client did not sanitize HTML entities in messages received from the network.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input sanitization leading to potential HTML injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could de-anonymize MuWire users by sending a message containing an HTML `<img>` tag with a URL pointing to a server controlled by the attacker. The client would attempt to fetch the image from the specified URL, revealing the user's IP address over clear net.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a specially crafted message over the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to know the target user's full MuWire ID and needs to be able to send messages to the target user.
