Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when constructing LDAP search filters. Specifically, the username provided during login is inserted into the `userSearchFilter` string without sufficient escaping of special characters.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **LDAP Injection:** The application is vulnerable to LDAP injection because it constructs LDAP queries by directly incorporating user input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** By injecting specially crafted strings into the username field during login, an attacker can manipulate the LDAP query and potentially extract information from the LDAP directory. This is achieved using Blind LDAP Injection techniques, where the attacker observes differences in error messages to deduce information.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Login Form:** The attack vector is through the login form where a user enters their username. An attacker can provide a malicious username string that is then used to construct a malicious LDAP query.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Access to Login Form:** The attacker needs access to the login form of the affected OneDev instance.
- **Knowledge of LDAP Structure:**  Some understanding of the LDAP directory structure and attributes can help an attacker to craft effective injection payloads and extract more information.
- **Understanding of Error Messages:** The attacker exploits blind LDAP injection by analyzing differences in error messages.

**Technical Details:**

- The vulnerable code is located in `LdapAuthenticator.java`, where the `authenticate` method takes a `UsernamePasswordToken` and uses the provided username to construct the `userSearchFilter`.
- The vulnerability occurs because the username is only partially sanitized before being used in a LDAP search:
    - vulnerable line: `String userSearchFilter = StringUtils.replace(getUserSearchFilter(), "{0}", token.getUsername());`
    - fixed line `String userSearchFilter = StringUtils.replace(getUserSearchFilter(), "{0}", escape(token.getUsername()));`
- The fix involves escaping special characters in the username using `escape(token.getUsername())` before constructing the LDAP query.
- The `escape` method iterates through each character of the provided value, replacing special characters with their respective escape sequences.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is described as low severity.
- The issue was discovered by the CodeQL static languages team.
- The specific payload depends on the configuration of the "User Search Filter" property in OneDev.
- The fix was introduced in version 4.4.2.
- CVE ID: CVE-2021-32651
