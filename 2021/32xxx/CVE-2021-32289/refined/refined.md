The provided content discusses a segmentation fault vulnerability in the `heif` library, specifically within the `nalutil.cpp` file.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a segmentation fault that occurs within the `convertByteStreamToRBSP` function in `nalutil.cpp` at line 49. The issue arises when processing a byte stream, leading to a memory access violation. The AddressSanitizer output indicates a READ memory access to the zero page (address 0x000000000000).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Memory Corruption:** The root cause is a memory access violation due to an out-of-bounds read that results in a segmentation fault. The vulnerability resides in the `convertByteStreamToRBSP` function which appears to incorrectly handle input data leading to a read from an invalid memory location. Specifically, the crash occurs when trying to construct a `vector` of `unsigned char`, implying that the logic to determine the size or contents of this vector is flawed.
- **Unhandled Input:** The issue is triggered when specific input is provided to the `convertByteStreamToRBSP` function, which appears to be inadequately validating the input data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the application or service that uses the `heif` library. This crash results in a denial of service.
- **Potential Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, a segmentation fault could potentially be leveraged for more severe attacks depending on the overall system configuration (e.g., in combination with other vulnerabilities).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through providing a crafted input byte stream to the `convertByteStreamToRBSP` function. The specific input that triggers the issue is provided in the `SEGV-convertByteStreamToRBSP-nalutil-49.zip` file, attached to the bug report.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the application or library that utilizes the vulnerable `convertByteStreamToRBSP` function. This typically involves control over the data being processed by the library.

**Additional details:**
- The issue was reported by `seviezhou` on August 4, 2020, and was resolved by `lassehe` with commit `b26a70` on August 12, 2020.
- The AddressSanitizer output provides a full stack trace leading to the exact location of the crash in `nalutil.cpp:49:10`, further aiding in debugging and confirming the vulnerability.
