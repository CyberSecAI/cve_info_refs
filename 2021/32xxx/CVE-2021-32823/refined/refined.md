```
{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the inefficient creation of certain classes within the BinData RubyGem, specifically when dealing with bit fields (e.g., BinData::Bit100000, BinData::Bit<N>).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Denial of Service (DoS) due to excessive CPU consumption during class creation."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could exploit this by combining user-controlled input with the `constantize` method in Ruby on Rails applications. This allows them to force the creation of very large bit field objects, resulting in a CPU-based DoS attack. The application would become unresponsive due to the excessive CPU usage.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Network-based attacks by sending requests with crafted input that is then passed to the `constantize` function."
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to supply user-controlled input to an application that utilizes the vulnerable versions of the `bindata` gem, where the input is then processed by `constantize`. No special access is required, and no user interaction is required.",
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability is present due to the way bit fields are handled in `bindata`. The issue was resolved by improving creation time of Bits and Integers in version 2.4.10."
