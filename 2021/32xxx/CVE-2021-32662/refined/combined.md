* Adds a new validation function to helpers to prevent generation when mkdocs.yml is not present or is invalid
* Handles vulnerability where docs_dir can be put in as an absolute path which copies and exposes the files from that absolute path in the file system

# TechDocs mkdocs.yml path traversal

Moderate

[Rugvip](/Rugvip)
published
GHSA-pgf8-28gg-vpr6
Jun 3, 2021

## Package

npm

@backstage/techdocs-common
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 0.6.5

## Patched versions

0.6.5

## Description

### Impact

A malicious actor could read sensitive files from the environment where TechDocs documentation is built and published by setting a particular path for `docs_dir` in `mkdocs.yml`. These files would then be available over the TechDocs backend API.

This vulnerability is mitigated by the fact that an attacker would need access to modify the `mkdocs.yml` in the documentation source code, and would also need access to the TechDocs backend API.

### Patches

The vulnerability is patched in the `0.6.3` release of `@backstage/techdocs-common`.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in the [Backstage repository](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)
* Visit our chat, linked to in [Backstage README](https://github.com/backstage/backstage)

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-32662

### Weaknesses

[CWE-22](/advisories?query=cwe%3A22)
