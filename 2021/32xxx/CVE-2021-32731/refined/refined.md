Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The reset password form in XWiki was displaying the user's email address in plain text, instead of obfuscating it, when a password reset request was initiated. This occurred because the `$email` variable was directly used in the message displayed to the user after requesting the password reset in the `resetpasswordinline.vm` template.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** The primary vulnerability is the exposure of user email addresses via the reset password form. This constitutes an information leak, a violation of confidentiality.
*   **Lack of Obfuscation:** The system failed to properly obfuscate or mask the user's email address in the reset password confirmation message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privacy Violation:** Attackers could obtain valid email addresses for registered users by initiating password reset requests.
*   **Targeted Attacks:** The disclosed email addresses could be used in phishing attacks, spam campaigns, or other social engineering attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The attack vector is network-based, as it is exploited through the web interface of the XWiki platform.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No special access required:** An attacker does not need to be authenticated or have any privileges to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Username:** The attacker needs to know a valid username on the XWiki instance to trigger the password reset functionality and obtain the associated email address.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the XWiki application to interact with the reset password form.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** XWiki versions 13.1RC1 and 13.1 are affected.
*   **Patched Version:** The issue is fixed in version 13.2RC1.
*   **Vulnerable Code:** The vulnerability was located in `xwiki-platform-web/src/main/webapp/templates/resetpasswordinline.vm`, where the email was not properly obfuscated.
*   **Patch:** The fix involves modifying the template to obfuscate the email address using `$services.mail.general.obfuscate($email)`.
*   **CWE:** The vulnerability is categorized as CWE-200 (Information Exposure).
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.3 (Moderate), with the following metrics: AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.

In summary, this is an information disclosure vulnerability where the reset password form reveals user email addresses to unauthenticated users by not obfuscating them when sending the password reset confirmation message.
