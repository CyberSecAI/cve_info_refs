Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Issue 1:** The `/Videos/{Id}/hls/{PlaylistId}/{SegmentId}.{SegmentContainer}` route in Emby Server improperly handles the `{SegmentId}.{SegmentContainer}` part of the URL, allowing an attacker to provide an absolute file path using Windows path separators (`\`, or `%5C` when URL encoded), leading to arbitrary file read.
*   **Issue 2:** The `/Images/Ratings/{theme}/{name}` and `/Images/MediaInfo/{theme}/{name}` routes allow unauthenticated arbitrary *image* file read. The `{theme}` or `{name}` parameters can be set to a relative or absolute path with Windows path separators. The routes append image file extensions, thus only image files can be read.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** Both issues stem from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-provided path components in the URL, which allows an attacker to escape the intended directory and access other files on the server.
*   **Unauthenticated Access:** The file reads are possible without any prior authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Access:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the server's file system. This could include configuration files, database files, application code, and other sensitive information.
*   **Information Disclosure:** Exposure of sensitive files can lead to further exploitation or unauthorized access to the system.
*   **Potential for System Compromise:** Depending on the accessed files, it could lead to full compromise of the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The vulnerabilities are exploited by sending specially crafted HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable endpoints with manipulated file paths.
    *   For issue 1, the request is made to the `/Videos` route. The `Id` needs to be known and can be obtained by an authenticated user.
    *   For issue 2, the request is made to the `/Images/Ratings` or `/Images/MediaInfo` routes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network access to the Emby Server.
*   **Knowledge of a Media ID (Issue 1):** For the arbitrary file read vulnerability in `/Videos`, the attacker needs to know the `Id` of a media file. This ID can be obtained by any authenticated user of the system. No such pre-requisite exists for issue 2.
*   **No Authentication:** No authentication is required to exploit either of the vulnerabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was tested on Emby Server version 4.5.4.0.
*   The issue affects Windows systems due to the use of Windows path separators.
*   The `/Images` routes are restricted to image file extensions.
*   The provided content does not contain information about how the vulnerability can be mitigated.
