Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32772

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize HTML characters from podcast feed data, leading to an OS Command Injection vulnerability. This occurs because the application uses `innerHTML` to display podcast information directly.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **OS Command Injection (CWE-78):** The core vulnerability is that the application doesn't neutralize special elements used in OS commands. By injecting malicious HTML and JavaScript code into podcast titles or other fields, an attacker can potentially execute arbitrary commands on the user's machine.
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The lack of proper HTML sanitization also introduces an XSS vulnerability. Malicious code can be injected into the application's UI. This vulnerability can be scaled to RCE due to the application being built using Electron.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's machine running the application. This could lead to complete system compromise, data theft, malware installation, or other malicious activities.
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** Through the injected Javascript, the attacker can force the execution of arbitrary commands.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Podcast Feed:** An attacker crafts a podcast or episode with malicious HTML/JS payload embedded within the title, subtitle, or other fields included in the feed.
- **User Interaction:** A user adds the malicious podcast to their favorites and views it through the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Create/Control a Podcast Feed:** The attacker needs to be able to create a podcast feed or inject malicious content into existing feeds.
- **Victim Must Use the Application:** The user must add the malicious podcast to the application.

**Specific Code Locations:**
- `helper_entries.js#L80`: Vulnerable code where `TitleElement.innerHTML = _Title` is used without sanitization.
- `feed.js#L285`:  Vulnerable code where `document.getElementsByClassName('settings-header')[0].innerHTML = ChannelName` is used without sanitization
- `favorite.js#L4-L14`: Shows how the feed data is processed but does not show any vulnerability here

**Additional details from content:**
- The provided content shows an example of how to trigger the RCE using a malicious podcast feed. By bookmarking the provided url into the application, the application opens firefox in linux and calculator in windows, as an example of the execution of arbitrary commands.
- The content also mentions that if a user sees the text "html injection here" underlined, there is also a separate XSS vulnerability.
