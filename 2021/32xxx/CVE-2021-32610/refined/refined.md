{
  "CVE-2021-32610": {
    "description": "In Archive_Tar before 1.4.14, symlinks can refer to targets outside of the extracted archive, a different vulnerability than CVE-2020-36193.",
    "root_cause": "Inadequate checking of symbolic links during tar archive extraction.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-59"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers could create symlinks pointing outside the intended extraction path, potentially leading to arbitrary file overwrite or other malicious actions if the system does not properly restrict the symlink creation target or the application is run with elevated privileges.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted tar archives with symlinks pointing to arbitrary paths outside the intended extraction directory"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to create a malicious tar archive and have it extracted using a vulnerable version of Archive_Tar.",
     "more_info": "The vulnerability is a directory traversal issue caused by improper handling of symbolic links in the Archive_Tar library. Specifically, when extracting a tar archive containing symbolic links, the library does not adequately check if the link target points to a location outside the intended extraction directory. This can allow an attacker to craft a malicious archive with symlinks that, when extracted, create files or modify files in arbitrary locations on the filesystem."
