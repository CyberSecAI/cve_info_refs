Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an inefficient procedure in Envoy for resetting HTTP/2 streams. This procedure has a time complexity of O(N^2), where N is the number of streams. This means the processing time increases quadratically with the number of streams, causing high CPU utilization when a large number of streams are reset simultaneously.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Algorithmic complexity vulnerability: The core issue is that the algorithm for handling HTTP/2 stream resets scales poorly with an increasing number of streams, leading to excessive CPU usage. Specifically, the use of a nested loop in the stream reset procedure introduces O(N^2) time complexity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): By opening and closing a large number of HTTP/2 streams, an attacker can force Envoy to spend excessive CPU time processing the resets. This can lead to a denial of service by making the Envoy instance unresponsive.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack: The attack is triggered by a client sending malicious HTTP/2 traffic to Envoy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to establish a network connection with the Envoy instance.
- The attacker needs the ability to generate HTTP/2 requests and to rapidly open and close a large number of HTTP/2 streams.
- No special privileges are needed.
