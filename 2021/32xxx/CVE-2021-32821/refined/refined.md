Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32821:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in a regular expression used within the mootools CSS selector parser. This regular expression is susceptible to ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service) due to ambiguity and overlapping clauses that cause exponential backtracking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **ReDoS:** The core vulnerability is a Regular Expression Denial of Service. The regex has overlapping patterns which cause it to evaluate very slowly when given specific input.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** By injecting a specially crafted string into a CSS selector, an attacker can force the vulnerable regular expression to consume excessive CPU resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **CSS Selector Injection:** The primary attack vector involves injecting a malicious string into a CSS selector that will be processed by mootools.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to influence or inject a string into a CSS selector that will be processed by the vulnerable `Slick.parse` function within mootools. This is common in cases where CSS selectors are dynamically generated or user-provided, such as when processing user input.

**Additional Information:**
* The provided document includes a detailed explanation of ReDoS vulnerabilities, along with examples of vulnerable and fixed regular expressions. This makes the document more useful than just the CVE description.
* The report includes a basic Proof of Concept (PoC) using `node` to demonstrate the vulnerability.
* The maintainers of mootools chose to treat this issue as "wontfix" due to low impact and lack of activity on the project.
