# Advisory Details

August 18th, 2021
## Siemens JT2Go DGN File Parsing Out-Of-Bounds Write Remote Code Execution Vulnerability

### ZDI-21-989ZDI-CAN-13417

| CVE ID | [CVE-2021-32952](https://www.cve.org/CVERecord?id=CVE-2021-32952) |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS SCORE | 7.8, [AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](http://nvd.nist.gov/cvss.cfm?calculator&version=3.0&vector=AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| AFFECTED VENDORS | Siemens |
| AFFECTED PRODUCTS | [JT2Go](https://www.plm.automation.siemens.com/global/en/products/plm-components/jt2go.html) |
| VULNERABILITY DETAILS | This vulnerability allows remote attackers to execute arbitrary code on affected installations of Siemens JT2Go. User interaction is required to exploit this vulnerability in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.  The specific flaw exists within the parsing of DGN files. The issue results from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data, which can result in a write past the end of an allocated buffer. An attacker can leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. |

## Made with ODA software

[#### 4M

Our overall outcome in terms of reliability and performance could never be achieved without adopting the ODA Platform.

[#### Advanced Computer Solutions

We made significant use of the ODA Architecture SDK and incorporated automatic scheduling, live energy calculations and intelligent drafting into Caddie. This means that a window is understood as a window and a door as a door, with a collection of relevant properties as opposed to a bunch of lines simply depicting the object.

[#### Bricsys

We couldn’t take BricsCAD® forward without the help of the ODA. Our in-house developers focus on UX, our Building Information Modeling products and bringing the power of Artificial Intelligence to CAD. If we didn’t have access to the Drawings SDK, we would need a huge team dedicated just to .dwg interoperability. That wouldn’t be profitable for us. Our ODA membership is a win-win for all concerned.

[#### Carlson Software

The ODA is the best in the business at what it does. The ODA Platform enables us to work with customers who are using .dwg- and .dgn-based CAD programs, and that opens up tremendous markets.

[#### Esri

Ultimately, ODA opens up possibilities for our own development efforts. It has freed us to follow new potential that we probably would not otherwise have attempted.

[#### IMSI/Design

We can trust the ODA to deliver .dwg basics while we concentrate on developing new and innovative products on both existing and emerging CAD platforms.  Our use of the ODA Platform enables us to focus on what we do best – create new functionality for a wide range of users.

[#### IntelliCAD Technology Consortium

IntelliCAD was the first native .dwg clone to use the ODA libraries, and after more than 20 years, IntelliCAD still depends on the ODA Platform for its core database to open, visualize, edit, and save .dwg and .dgn files without conversion or data loss. History has shown that we can depend on the ODA to deliver core technology to meet our requirements now, and in the future.

[#### Knowledge Base

Using the ODA Platform, we can quickly and easily keep in step with technological changes, maintain better compliance with .dwg files and direct our efforts to other areas such as making our software more powerful and feature rich.

SSA-155599: File Parsing Vulnerabilities in COMOS

Publication Date:
Last Update:
Current Version:
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

2022-03-08
V1.0

SUMMARY

COMOS uses Drawings SDK from Open Design Alliance that is affected by multiple vulnerabilities that
could be triggered when the application reads ﬁles in DGN, DXF or DWG ﬁle formats. If a user is tricked
to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected application, an attacker could leverage the vulnerability to leak
information or potentially perform remote code execution in the context of the current process.

Siemens has released an update for the COMOS and recommends to update to the latest version.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources in COMOS

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

COMOS is a uniﬁed data platform for collaborative plant design, operation and management that supports
collecting, processing, saving, and distributing of information throughout the entire plant lifecycle.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be

SSA-155599

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Teamcenter Visualization software enables enterprises to enhance their product lifecycle management
(PLM) environment with a comprehensive family of visualization solutions. The software enables enter-
prise users to access documents, 2D drawings and 3D models in a single environment.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
