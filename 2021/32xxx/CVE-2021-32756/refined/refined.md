- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `MiqExpression` module in ManageIQ allows a low-privilege user to inject a crafted Ruby string that gets evaluated.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Arbitrary code execution due to the evaluation of user-controlled input within the `MiqExpression` module. This is a classic case of "eval injection" or insecure deserialization where user-supplied data is treated as code.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the host system.
- **Attack vectors**: A low-privilege user can provide a malicious Ruby string through the `MiqExpression` module.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  The attacker needs to be a low-privilege user of the ManageIQ application and needs to be able to interact with the `MiqExpression` module and be able to inject malicious Ruby code.
