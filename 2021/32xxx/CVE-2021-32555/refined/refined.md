The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-32555.

**CVE-2021-32555**
*   **Root cause:** Arbitrary file read vulnerability in `attach_3d_info` function of `package-hooks/source_xorg.py`. The function uses a potentially user-controlled file path from `/tmp` without checking if it's a symbolic link.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization and symbolic link checking of file paths derived from user-controlled data.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files by creating a symbolic link at `/tmp/compiz_internal_state<pid>` that points to a file they want to read. This can lead to information disclosure.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   An attacker needs to create a symbolic link in the `/tmp` directory with the name `compiz_internal_state<pid>`.
    *   The attacker then needs to trigger a crash report that includes the vulnerable code path.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to have the ability to write to the `/tmp` directory.
    *   The system's `fs.protected_symlinks` sysctl setting needs to be set to `0`.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the creation of a crash report.

This issue is present in the `xorg-hwe-18.04` package.
