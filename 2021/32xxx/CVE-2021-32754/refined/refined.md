- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to an Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference in FlowDroid when parsing XML source/sink definition files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: XML External Entity (XXE) injection (CWE-611).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with control over the source/sink definition file can exploit the XXE vulnerability to read arbitrary files from external locations.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves the attacker manipulating the source/sink definition file, which must be in XML format.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to control the source/sink definition file that is processed by FlowDroid. This implies that the attacker might have some level of access to the system where FlowDroid is running, or might be able to manipulate the file before it is processed.
