Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-32761:

**1. Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   Integer overflow issues within the `BITFIELD` command of Redis. This is specifically a problem on 32-bit systems where the integer overflow can lead to heap corruption.

**2. Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The `BITFIELD` command in Redis versions prior to 5.0.13, 6.0.15, and 6.2.5 is susceptible to integer overflows on 32-bit systems. This occurs when a calculation results in a value larger than the maximum value the data type can hold.
*   **Heap Corruption**:  The integer overflow can lead to corruption of the heap memory.

**3. Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure**:  Sensitive information could potentially be disclosed.
*   **Data Modification**: An attacker could add or modify data.
*   **Denial of Service (DoS)**:  The vulnerability could be exploited to cause a crash or make Redis unavailable.
*   **Remote Code Execution**: In some cases, exploitation could lead to remote code execution.

**4. Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is network-based, meaning that a remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
*   The vulnerability is exploited through the `BITFIELD` command, which is part of the Redis protocol.

**5. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Low Privileges:**  The attacker needs low level access to Redis.
*   **Network access**: The attacker needs the ability to send commands to the Redis instance through the network.
*   **Knowledge of Redis Protocol**:  The attacker needs to be familiar with Redis commands and able to craft specific `BITFIELD` commands to trigger the vulnerability.
*   The attacker must be on a 32-bit system or targeting a 32-bit Redis binary.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

*   **NetApp Products:** Multiple NetApp products incorporate Redis. The vulnerability could lead to disclosure of sensitive information, data modification, or denial of service. Only "Management Services for Element Software and NetApp HCI" were listed as affected products, while others such as Clustered Data ONTAP were specifically listed as not affected
*   **Gentoo Linux:** The vulnerability is mentioned as part of a broader security advisory for `dev-db/redis` on Gentoo, highlighting that versions prior to 7.0.5 are affected. The Gentoo advisory categorizes the exploit as "remote"
*   **Debian:**  Debian issued a security advisory (DSA 5001-1) for redis, and another (DLA 2717-1 and DLA 2717-2 ) for LTS versions, fixing the issue in versions 5:5.0.14-1+deb10u1 (buster) and 5:6.0.16-1+deb11u1 (bullseye), and 3:3.2.6-3+deb9u6 for Debian 9 "Stretch" . This shows that multiple Debian versions were impacted.
*  **Fedora:** Fedora also issued updates, listing the vulnerability as affecting redis versions before 6.2.5-1.fc34 on Fedora 34 and versions before 6.0.15-1.fc33 on Fedora 33
*   **Mitigation:** NetApp and Gentoo mention that preventing users from modifying the `proto-max-bulk-len` config parameter or restricting usage of BITFIELD command can mitigate the issue without patching the server.
* **CVSS Score:** The NetApp advisory lists a CVSS v3 score of 7.5 (HIGH) with the vector string `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H`
