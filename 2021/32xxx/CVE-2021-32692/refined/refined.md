{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `printAppTitle.scpt` script used by aw-watcher-window on macOS was vulnerable to shell injection via the application's window title. The script was using the window title without proper sanitization which allowed for arbitrary shell command execution.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Shell injection vulnerability",
     "Lack of input sanitization"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker could execute arbitrary commands on the macOS machine running ActivityWatch. This could lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, malware installation, and other malicious activities.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Visiting a malicious website that sets the page title to a crafted string",
    "Another application that can set the target application's window title to a malicious string"
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to induce a user to open a web browser (or other application) such that its window title is set to a malicious string crafted by the attacker. No privileges are required for the attacker. User interaction is required."
