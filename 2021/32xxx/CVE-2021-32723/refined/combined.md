# Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Prism

High

[RunDevelopment](/RunDevelopment)
published
GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg
Jun 28, 2021

## Package

npm

prismjs
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<1.24

## Patched versions

1.24

## Description

Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

### Impact

When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. Do not use the following languages to highlight untrusted text.

* ASCIIDoc
* ERB

Other languages are **not** affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text.

### Patches

This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24.

### References

* [#2774](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2774)
* [#2688](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2688)

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-32723

### Weaknesses

[CWE-400](/advisories?query=cwe%3A400)

### @RunDevelopment **[RunDevelopment](/RunDevelopment)** commented [Feb 25, 2021](#issue-816795310)

I worked on refa over the last couple of days and added 2 major improvements:

1. The parser will now resolve certain backreferences. E.g. `/("|')(?:(?!\1)[^\\\r\n]|\\.)*\1/` will be parsed as `/"(?:(?!")[^\\\r\n]|\\.)*"|'(?:(?!')[^\\\r\n]|\\.)*'/`.
2. Assertions can be applied to the pattern. E.g. `/"(?:(?!")[^\\\r\n]|\\.)*"/` -> `/"(?:[^"\\\r\n]|\\.)*"/`.

These two additions enable our current exponential backtracking test to analyze a few more regexes. And guess what, it found new cases of exponential backtracking. The AsciiDoc ones are true positives and have been fixed. The Perl one is a false positive but I "fixed" it anyway.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2021-32723](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg)

Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial
of Service (ReDoS).

### Impact

When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker
can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. Do
not use the following languages to highlight untrusted text.

- ASCIIDoc
- ERB

Other languages are __not__ affected and can be used to highlight
untrusted text.

### Patches
This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24.

### References

- PrismJS/prism#2774
- PrismJS/prism#2688

#### [CVE-2021-3801](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3801)

Prism is a syntax highlighting library. The prismjs package is
vulnerable to ReDoS (regular expression denial of service). An attacker
that is able to provide a crafted HTML comment as input may cause an
application to consume an excessive amount of CPU.

####
[CVE-2022-23647](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-3949-f494-cm99)

### Impact
Prism's [Command line plugin](https://prismjs.com/plugins/command-line/)
can be used by attackers to achieve an XSS attack. The Command line
plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text
being inserted into the DOM as HTML code.

Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the
Command Line plugin are also not impacted.

### Patches
This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0.

### Workarounds
Do not use the Command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitized all
code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use
the Command line plugin.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2021-32723](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg)

Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial
of Service (ReDoS).

### Impact

When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker
can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. Do
not use the following languages to highlight untrusted text.

- ASCIIDoc
- ERB

Other languages are __not__ affected and can be used to highlight
untrusted text.

### Patches
This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24.

### References

- PrismJS/prism#2774
- PrismJS/prism#2688

#### [CVE-2021-3801](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3801)

Prism is a syntax highlighting library. The prismjs package is
vulnerable to ReDoS (regular expression denial of service). An attacker
that is able to provide a crafted HTML comment as input may cause an
application to consume an excessive amount of CPU.

####
[CVE-2022-23647](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-3949-f494-cm99)

### Impact
Prism's [Command line plugin](https://prismjs.com/plugins/command-line/)
can be used by attackers to achieve an XSS attack. The Command line
plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text
being inserted into the DOM as HTML code.

Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the
Command Line plugin are also not impacted.

### Patches
This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0.

### Workarounds
Do not use the Command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitized all
code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use
the Command line plugin.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2021-32723](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg)

Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial
of Service (ReDoS).

### Impact

When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker
can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. Do
not use the following languages to highlight untrusted text.

- ASCIIDoc
- ERB

Other languages are __not__ affected and can be used to highlight
untrusted text.

### Patches
This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24.

### References

- PrismJS/prism#2774
- PrismJS/prism#2688

#### [CVE-2021-3801](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3801)

Prism is a syntax highlighting library. The prismjs package is
vulnerable to ReDoS (regular expression denial of service). An attacker
that is able to provide a crafted HTML comment as input may cause an
application to consume an excessive amount of CPU.

####
[CVE-2022-23647](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-3949-f494-cm99)

### Impact
Prism's [Command line plugin](https://prismjs.com/plugins/command-line/)
can be used by attackers to achieve an XSS attack. The Command line
plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text
being inserted into the DOM as HTML code.

Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the
Command Line plugin are also not impacted.

### Patches
This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0.

### Workarounds
Do not use the Command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitized all
code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use
the Command line plugin.

# Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) in Prism

High

[RunDevelopment](/RunDevelopment)
published
GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg
Jun 28, 2021

## Package

npm

prismjs
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<1.24

## Patched versions

1.24

## Description

Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS).

### Impact

When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. Do not use the following languages to highlight untrusted text.

* ASCIIDoc
* ERB

Other languages are **not** affected and can be used to highlight untrusted text.

### Patches

This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24.

### References

* [#2774](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2774)
* [#2688](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/pull/2688)

### Severity

High

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-32723

### Weaknesses

[CWE-400](/advisories?query=cwe%3A400)

### @RunDevelopment **[RunDevelopment](/RunDevelopment)** commented [Jan 2, 2021](#issue-777465100)

This improves the static pattern test to check every regex.

### Method

This is achieved by running all test files for a given language and overwriting the `Prism.tokenize` function itself. The `tokenize` function will be replaced with a function that runs all checks on the grammar given to the function and then uses the original `tokenize` function. Assuming that our test files cover (nearly) all aspects of our languages, this approach will analyze all regexes used in grammar.

This runtime approach is necessary because some languages (e.g. PHP and Latte) use markup templating (MT) which changes the grammar with one that might not be reachable from `Prism.languages`.

However, even this isn't enough. MT also requires a regex to detect the embedded language ([example](https://github.com/PrismJS/prism/blob/1506f345b0c917b28047ec6e5b8b8dc81790ad98/components/prism-php.js#L306)). This pattern isn't passed to `Prism.tokenize`.

To analyze these regexes for super-linear runtime, the prototype of the `RegExp` type itself is changed to replace the `exec` and `test` methods with methods that run the analysis for every regex that is used throughout the tests.

### Problem

The only problem with this approach is that it is slow.

To statically analyze all regexes, I need about 2s, and to run all test files, I need about another 2s on my machine. However, the exhaustive pattern test takes 9s on my machine.

This is because of the `RegExp` prototype magic that forces us to take the [slow path](https://v8.dev/blog/speeding-up-regular-expressions). Without the prototype magic, the whole thing only takes 5s on my machine.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2021-32723](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg)

Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial
of Service (ReDoS).

### Impact

When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker
can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. Do
not use the following languages to highlight untrusted text.

- ASCIIDoc
- ERB

Other languages are __not__ affected and can be used to highlight
untrusted text.

### Patches
This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24.

### References

- PrismJS/prism#2774
- PrismJS/prism#2688

#### [CVE-2021-3801](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3801)

Prism is a syntax highlighting library. The prismjs package is
vulnerable to ReDoS (regular expression denial of service). An attacker
that is able to provide a crafted HTML comment as input may cause an
application to consume an excessive amount of CPU.

####
[CVE-2022-23647](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-3949-f494-cm99)

### Impact
Prism's [Command line plugin](https://prismjs.com/plugins/command-line/)
can be used by attackers to achieve an XSS attack. The Command line
plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text
being inserted into the DOM as HTML code.

Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the
Command Line plugin are also not impacted.

### Patches
This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0.

### Workarounds
Do not use the Command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitized all
code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use
the Command line plugin.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2021-32723](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg)

Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial
of Service (ReDoS).

### Impact

When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker
can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. Do
not use the following languages to highlight untrusted text.

- ASCIIDoc
- ERB

Other languages are __not__ affected and can be used to highlight
untrusted text.

### Patches
This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24.

### References

- PrismJS/prism#2774
- PrismJS/prism#2688

#### [CVE-2021-3801](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3801)

Prism is a syntax highlighting library. The prismjs package is
vulnerable to ReDoS (regular expression denial of service). An attacker
that is able to provide a crafted HTML comment as input may cause an
application to consume an excessive amount of CPU.

####
[CVE-2022-23647](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-3949-f494-cm99)

### Impact
Prism's [Command line plugin](https://prismjs.com/plugins/command-line/)
can be used by attackers to achieve an XSS attack. The Command line
plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text
being inserted into the DOM as HTML code.

Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the
Command Line plugin are also not impacted.

### Patches
This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0.

### Workarounds
Do not use the Command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitized all
code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use
the Command line plugin.

### GitHub Vulnerability Alerts

####
[CVE-2021-32723](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-gj77-59wh-66hg)

Some languages before 1.24.0 are vulnerable to Regular Expression Denial
of Service (ReDoS).

### Impact

When Prism is used to highlight untrusted (user-given) text, an attacker
can craft a string that will take a very very long time to highlight. Do
not use the following languages to highlight untrusted text.

- ASCIIDoc
- ERB

Other languages are __not__ affected and can be used to highlight
untrusted text.

### Patches
This problem has been fixed in Prism v1.24.

### References

- PrismJS/prism#2774
- PrismJS/prism#2688

#### [CVE-2021-3801](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-3801)

Prism is a syntax highlighting library. The prismjs package is
vulnerable to ReDoS (regular expression denial of service). An attacker
that is able to provide a crafted HTML comment as input may cause an
application to consume an excessive amount of CPU.

####
[CVE-2022-23647](https://togithub.com/PrismJS/prism/security/advisories/GHSA-3949-f494-cm99)

### Impact
Prism's [Command line plugin](https://prismjs.com/plugins/command-line/)
can be used by attackers to achieve an XSS attack. The Command line
plugin did not properly escape its output, leading to the input text
being inserted into the DOM as HTML code.

Server-side usage of Prism is not impacted. Websites that do not use the
Command Line plugin are also not impacted.

### Patches
This bug has been fixed in v1.27.0.

### Workarounds
Do not use the Command line plugin on untrusted inputs, or sanitized all
code blocks (remove all HTML code text) from all code blocks that use
the Command line plugin.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.
