------------------------------------------------------------------------------

[-] Software Link:

<https://invisioncommunity.com>

[-] Affected Versions:

Version 4.5.4.2 and prior versions.

The vulnerability exists because the
IPS\cms\modules\front\pages\\_builder::previewBlock() method allows to
pass arbitrary content to the IPS\\_Theme::runProcessFunction() method,
which will be used in a call to the eval() PHP function. This can be

exploitation of this vulnerability requires an account with permission
to manage the sidebar (such as a Moderator or Administrator) and the
"cms" application to be enabled.
