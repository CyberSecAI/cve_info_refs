- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Heap-based buffer overflow
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write due to a heap buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: When the device is connecting to a 2G cellular network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No additional execution privileges needed, no user interaction is needed for exploitation.
