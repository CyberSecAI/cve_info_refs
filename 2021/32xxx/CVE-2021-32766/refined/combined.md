# Nextcloud Text app can disclose existence of folders in "File Drop" link share

Low

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-gcf3-3wmc-88jr
Sep 6, 2021

## Package

Nextcloud Server

## Affected versions

< 20.0.12, < 21.0.4, < 22.1.0

## Patched versions

20.0.12, 21.0.4, 22.1.0

## Description

### Impact

The Nextcloud Text application shipped with Nextcloud Server returned different error messages depending on whether a folder existed in a public link share. This is problematic in case the public link share has been created with "Upload Only" privileges. (aka "File Drop")

A link share recipient is not expected to see which folders or files exist in a "File Drop" share. Using this vulnerability an attacker is able to enumerate folders in such a share. Exploitation requires that the attacker has access to a valid affected "File Drop" link share.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 20.0.12, 21.0.4 or 22.1.0

### Workarounds

Disable the Nextcloud Text application in the app settings.
