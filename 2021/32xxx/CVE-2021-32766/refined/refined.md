Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Nextcloud Text application was returning different error messages depending on whether a folder existed within a public "File Drop" link share. This allowed an attacker to infer the existence of folders.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Information Disclosure:** The application was leaking information about the existence of folders in a "File Drop" share by providing different error messages depending on the folder's presence.
- **Error Message Differentiation:** The core issue was the lack of consistent error handling, which inadvertently revealed information about the share's contents.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Enumeration of Folders:** An attacker could use this vulnerability to enumerate folders within a "File Drop" link share. This is a violation of the "Upload Only" principle, where the share recipient should not be able to see existing files/folders.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Public Link Share:** The attack vector is a "File Drop" link share. Specifically, a link share created with "Upload Only" privileges

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Valid "File Drop" Link:** The attacker must have access to a valid affected "File Drop" link share to exploit this vulnerability.
