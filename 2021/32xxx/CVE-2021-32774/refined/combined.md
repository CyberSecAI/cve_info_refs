# Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) in DataDump

Moderate

[RhinosF1](/RhinosF1)
published
GHSA-29mh-4vhv-x8mr
Jul 19, 2021

## Package

DataDump
(MediaWiki Extension)

## Affected versions

Not known

## Patched versions

67a82b76e186925330b89ace9c5fd893a300830b

## Description

### Impact

Prior to [67a82b7](https://github.com/miraheze/DataDump/commit/67a82b76e186925330b89ace9c5fd893a300830b), DataDump had no protection against CSRF attacks so requests to generate or delete dumps could be forged.

### Patches

You should either update DataDump to the latest version or apply the [patch](https://github.com/miraheze/DataDump/commit/67a82b76e186925330b89ace9c5fd893a300830b.patch).

### Workarounds

There are no known workarounds. You must completely disable DataDump.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

DataDump is vulnerable to CSRF attacks as it does not add and check for tokens. This means that requests to generate or delete dumps can easily be forged.
