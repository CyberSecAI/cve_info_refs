The content is related to CVE-2021-32625.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Integer overflow in the `STRALGO LCS` command within Redis versions 6.0 and later.
- The vulnerability stems from an incomplete fix of CVE-2021-29477.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow leading to heap corruption.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential remote code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Attacker needs to have low level privileges to send a `STRALGO LCS` command.
- Attacker needs network access to Redis.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability affects Redis versions 6.0 and later.
- The vulnerability is fixed in Redis versions 6.2.4 and 6.0.14.
- A workaround is to use ACL configuration to prevent clients from using the `STRALGO LCS` command.
- On 64-bit systems that have the fixes of CVE-2021-29477, setting `proto-max-bulk-len` config parameter to be smaller than 2GB (default is 512MB) mitigates the problem.
