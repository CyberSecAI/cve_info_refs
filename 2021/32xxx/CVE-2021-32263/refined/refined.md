The content is related to CVE-2021-32263.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow in the `ok_csv_circular_buffer_read()` function, located in `ok_csv.c:95`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A heap-buffer-overflow exists due to improper handling of a circular buffer read operation in `ok_csv_circular_buffer_read`. This is triggered when processing a specially crafted CSV file, leading to a write beyond allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation of the vulnerability leads to a heap-buffer-overflow, potentially causing a crash, denial of service, or potentially arbitrary code execution. The provided Address Sanitizer report shows a write of size 181 at an address that is 0 bytes to the right of an allocated 64-byte region.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves supplying a crafted CSV file as input to the vulnerable program. The `ok_csv_read` function is used to parse this file, which subsequently calls `ok_csv_circular_buffer_read`, where the overflow occurs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to supply a malicious CSV file to the vulnerable application. The attacker would need to be able to execute a program that reads the file with the vulnerable library.
