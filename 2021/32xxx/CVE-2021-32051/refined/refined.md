Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-32051:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a SQL injection flaw in the `DownloadPublicFile` component of the Hexagon G!nius Auskunftsportal. Specifically, the `id` parameter within the download functionality is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application fails to properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input (specifically the `id` parameter) before using it in an SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Complete Database Compromise:** Successful exploitation can lead to the complete compromise of the database's data integrity, as indicated by the text.
- **Information Disclosure:** Attackers can potentially gain unauthorized access to sensitive information stored within the database.
- **Privilege Escalation:** By exploiting the SQL injection, the attacker might be able to escalate privileges within the database to the level of the database user, or even DBA.
- **Data Manipulation:** Depending on the database user's privileges, the attacker could manipulate or delete data in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via HTTP requests to the affected web application.
- **Specific URL:** The attack vector is the `DownloadPublicFile` endpoint, accessible via a URL structure similar to `https://[affected site root]/GiPWorkflow/Service/DownloadPublicFile?id=...`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server where the affected G!nius Auskunftsportal is running.
- No prior authentication is needed as the vulnerability is in an unauthenticated portion of the application.
- The attacker needs to have a basic understanding of SQL injection techniques.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a single quote (') character in the `id` parameter, as seen in the example: `https://[affected site root]/GiPWorkflow/Service/DownloadPublicFile?id=DS'`
- This quote disrupts the original SQL query and allows for the injection of a `UNION SELECT` statement.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) payload demonstrates how to use `UNION SELECT` to extract data from the database, including the banner information indicating an Oracle database.
- The attacker can then inject further SQL to retrieve sensitive information or manipulate the database.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was confirmed by the vendor (Hexagon)
- A patch was released and deployed to address the vulnerability prior to public disclosure
- The affected product is Hexagon G!nius Auskunftsportal versions prior to 5.0.0.0.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Marcel Keiffenheim.
