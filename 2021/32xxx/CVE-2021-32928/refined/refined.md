- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Thales Sentinel LDK Run-Time Environment (RTE) installer creates a firewall rule allowing incoming connections on TCP port 1947. During uninstallation, the uninstaller fails to remove this rule and close the port, leaving it exposed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Incomplete cleanup (CWE-459), specifically the failure to remove the firewall rule and close the open port (TCP 1947) during uninstallation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could connect to the open port (1947), potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system. The impact is rated as High for Confidentiality, Integrity and Availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks targeting the exposed TCP port 1947.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker can be remote and requires low complexity to exploit this vulnerability. User interaction is required during the uninstallation process by the user.
