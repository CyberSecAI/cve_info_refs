# Failure to Sanitize Special Elements into a Different Plane (Special Element Injection) in notebook

Critical

[Carreau](/Carreau)
published
GHSA-hwvq-6gjx-j797
Aug 9, 2021

## Package

pip

notebook
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

<6.4.1, <5.7.11

## Patched versions

5.7.11, 6.4.1

## Description

### Impact

Untrusted notebook can execute code on load. This is a remote code execution, but requires user action to open a notebook.

### Patches

5.7.11, 6.4.1

### References

[OWASP Page on Injection Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html#injection-prevention-rules)

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, or vulnerabilities to report, please email our security list security@ipython.org.

Credit: Guillaume Jeanne from Google

### Example:

A notebook with the following content in a cell and it would display an alert when opened for the first time in Notebook (in an untrusted state):

```
{ "cell_type": "code", "execution_count": 0, "metadata": {}, "outputs": [ { "data": { "text/html": [ "<select><iframe></select><img src=x: onerror=alert('xss')>\n"], "text/plain": [] }, "metadata": {}, "output_type": "display_data" } ], "source": [ "" ] }

```

### Severity

Critical

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-32798

### Weaknesses

[CWE-75](/advisories?query=cwe%3A75) [CWE-80](/advisories?query=cwe%3A80)
