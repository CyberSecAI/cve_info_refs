Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32703:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of rate limiting on the `/shareinfo` endpoint in Nextcloud.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Missing rate limiting on the `/shareinfo` endpoint, which is used to retrieve information about a shared resource using a share token.
- This allows for an attacker to make a large number of requests to the endpoint without being throttled.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Share Token Enumeration:** An attacker could potentially enumerate valid share tokens by making numerous requests to the `/shareinfo` endpoint. This could lead to unauthorized access to shared resources if the attacker guesses or finds a valid share token.
- Potential for Denial of Service (DoS) by overwhelming the server with requests, although this is not explicitly mentioned as the primary impact.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack, specifically by sending HTTP requests to the `/shareinfo` endpoint.
- The attacker would need to be able to reach the Nextcloud server over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have network access to the Nextcloud instance.
- No authentication is mentioned as being required to exploit this vulnerability, so it is likely that an unauthenticated user could attempt this attack.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in Nextcloud versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3.
- The vulnerability has a "Low" severity rating by GitHub. However, it is included in a Fedora update that states it fixes a "high severity" and multiple "low severity" CVEs. This indicates that the severity rating may be context-dependent.
- A related pull request on GitHub exists to add bruteforce protection to the `/shareinfo` endpoint
- This vulnerability is also referenced by the Gentoo security advisory, indicating its broad impact.
