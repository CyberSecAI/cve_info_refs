The provided content is related to CVE-2021-32957.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a function that retrieves system information for a specific process. This function executes multiple commands and summarizes the information into an XML format. The function gives the full path to the executable, making it susceptible to binary hijacking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427): The application's reliance on full executable paths in system information retrieval allows an attacker to potentially replace legitimate binaries with malicious ones.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to hijack the execution flow of the application by replacing legitimate executables with malicious ones. This could lead to arbitrary code execution, system compromise, data manipulation, or denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could exploit this vulnerability remotely.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have a detailed understanding of the product architecture and database structure. They must be able to place a malicious executable in the search path ahead of the legitimate one. The attacker does not need existing user credentials or access.
