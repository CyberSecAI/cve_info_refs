{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The `vi_pci_write` function in `virtio.c` does not check if the `vc_cfgwrite` function pointer is NULL before dereferencing it. The `vtrnd` device does not implement the `vc_cfgwrite` function, resulting in a null pointer dereference when a guest attempts a write operation to the virtio configuration space of a device with no configuration write function.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Null pointer dereference"
    ],
    "impact": "A malicious guest can cause the host to crash, leading to a denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "A malicious guest can trigger the vulnerability by performing a write to the virtio configuration space of the `vtrnd` device.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have control over a guest OS running on the vulnerable hyperkit hypervisor and must be able to write to a device's virtio configuration space.",
     "details": "The `vi_pci_write` function in `src/lib/virtio.c` attempts to call a device-specific configuration write function, `vc->vc_cfgwrite`, without checking if the function pointer is NULL. This function pointer is part of the `virtio_consts` structure. The `vtrnd` (virtio random number generator) device has this function pointer set to NULL in its `virtio_consts` declaration. When the guest attempts a configuration write to `vtrnd`, the hypervisor will try to dereference a null function pointer and crash."
