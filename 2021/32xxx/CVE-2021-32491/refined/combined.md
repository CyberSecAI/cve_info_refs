Hi, could you try whether including <stdint.h> instead of <cstdint> fixes the issue?   > Another question: Is it necessary for us to check whether `rrect.h` is 0 to > avoid division by zero errors?  Yes, I think that we should check this because of the division.   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1943409#c4)  1vanChen    2021-04-23 16:04:33 UTC  ``` > Hi, could you try whether including <stdint.h> instead of <cstdint> fixes > the issue?

Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1943409#c7)  Ben Cotton    2021-11-04 15:29:57 UTC  ``` This message is a reminder that Fedora 33 is nearing its end of life. Fedora will stop maintaining and issuing updates for Fedora 33 on 2021-11-30. It is Fedora's policy to close all bug reports from releases that are no longer maintained. At that time this bug will be closed as EOL if it remains open with a Fedora 'version' of '33'.  Package Maintainer: If you wish for this bug to remain open because you plan to fix it in a currently maintained version, simply change the 'version'  to a later Fedora version.  Thank you for reporting this issue and we are sorry that we were not  able to fix it before Fedora 33 is end of life. If you would still like  to see this bug fixed and are able to reproduce it against a later version  of Fedora, you are encouraged  change the 'version' to a later Fedora  version prior this bug is closed as described in the policy above.  Although we aim to fix as many bugs as possible during every release's  lifetime, sometimes those efforts are overtaken by events. Often a  more recent Fedora release includes newer upstream software that fixes  bugs or makes them obsolete.   ```  [Comment 8](show_bug.cgi?id=1943409#c8)  Marek Kašík    2021-11-25 15:21:18 UTC  ``` This has been fixed quite some time ago (since Fedora 32).   ``` |  |

Debian Bug     : 945114 988215

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in djvulibre, a library and
set of tools to handle documents in the DjVu format. An attacker could
crash document viewers and possibly execute arbitrary code through
crafted DjVu files.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 3.5.27.1-10+deb10u1.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 3.5.28-2.

We recommend that you upgrade your djvulibre packages.

For the detailed security status of djvulibre please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/djvulibre>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be
