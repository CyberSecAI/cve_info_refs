Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32491:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   An integer overflow occurs in the `render()` function within the `tools/ddjvu.cpp` file of the djvulibre library. Specifically, the multiplication of `rowsize` and `rrect.h` results in an integer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Integer Overflow:** The multiplication of `rowsize` and `rrect.h` exceeds the maximum value that can be stored in the allocated memory, leading to a smaller allocation than expected. This smaller buffer is later used by a write operation, leading to a heap-buffer-overflow.
*   **Heap-buffer-overflow:** Due to the integer overflow resulting in undersized allocation, a heap-buffer-overflow occurs during the subsequent write operation when rendering a page.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The code does not adequately validate the input values (`rowsize` and `rrect.h`) before performing the multiplication, leading to the overflow. Additionally, there was no check for division by zero on `rrect.h`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Application crash:** The heap-buffer-overflow leads to an application crash due to memory corruption.
*   **Potential arbitrary code execution:**  Although not explicitly stated, the memory corruption due to the overflow can potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited further.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Crafted DjVu file:** The vulnerability is triggered when a specially crafted DjVu file is processed by the `ddjvu` tool.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to supply a crafted DjVu file to an application using the vulnerable djvulibre library.
*   No specific privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by 1vanChen of NSFOCUS Security Team.
*   A patch was created to address the issue, which includes:
    *   Casting the calculation to `size_t`.
    *   Checking for an overflow by comparing the result to `SIZE_MAX`.
    *  Checking if `rrect.h` is 0 to avoid division by zero errors.
*   The fix was implemented in `djvulibre-3.5.27-24.fc32` and `djvulibre-3.5.27-27.fc33` and later versions
*   The vulnerability affects multiple products, including Fedora, RHEL, and Debian
