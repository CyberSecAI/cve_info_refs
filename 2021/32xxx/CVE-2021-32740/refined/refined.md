The provided content relates to CVE-2021-32740.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the URI template implementation of the Addressable gem. A maliciously crafted template can cause uncontrolled resource consumption when matched against a URI, leading to a denial of service (DoS). This is due to catastrophic backtracking in the regular expression used for matching the template.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS) due to uncontrolled resource consumption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network. A remote attacker can provide a maliciously crafted template to the Addressable library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted URI template to the `Addressable::Template#match` function. No specific privileges or user interaction are required. The attacker can be remote and does not need local access.
