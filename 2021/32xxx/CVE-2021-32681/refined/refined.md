{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Improper escaping of HTML in Wagtail StreamField blocks.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-site Scripting (CWE-79)"
    ],
    "impact": "Users with the ability to author StreamField content ('editor' access to Wagtail admin) could insert arbitrary HTML or scripting, leading to potential XSS attacks.",
     "attack_vectors": "By inserting malicious HTML or JavaScript code into a StreamField block (CharBlock, TextBlock, or similar) when using the `{% include_block %}` template tag without proper escaping.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs 'editor' access to the Wagtail admin interface, which allows them to create or modify StreamField content."
  },
  "affected_versions": [
    "<2.11.8",
    "2.12-2.12.4",
    "2.13-2.13.1"
  ],
  "patched_versions": [
    "2.11.8",
    "2.12.5",
    "2.13.2"
  ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered when the `{% include_block %}` template tag is used to output the value of a plain-text StreamField block (`CharBlock`, `TextBlock` or a similar user-defined block derived from `FieldBlock`), and that block does not specify a template for rendering. The issue only occurs when `{% include_block %}` is used directly on that block; uses of `include_block` on a block *containing* a CharBlock / TextBlock, such as a StructBlock, are unaffected."
