Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32726:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the fact that WebAuthn tokens were not being properly deleted when a user was deleted from Nextcloud.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incomplete cleanup of user-related data, specifically WebAuthn tokens, upon user deletion.
