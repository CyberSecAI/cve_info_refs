Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32622

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the `matrix-react-sdk` handles local file previews during the upload process. It does not properly sanitize the MIME type of uploaded files, leading to potential execution of embedded scripts within the preview.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper sanitization of MIME types for uploaded files during the local preview process.
- Lack of input validation on uploaded files that would prevent execution of embedded scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A local user uploading a file could be vulnerable to the execution of embedded scripts present in the file.
- The exploit is limited to the local user performing the upload, and does not extend to remote users or other users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to craft a file containing embedded scripts, and convince the victim to upload the file.
- The user would need to interact with the file preview in a separate tab for the exploit to occur.
- Exploitation requires multiple user interactions to open the file preview in a separate tab after uploading.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide a file to the victim containing malicious embedded scripts.
- The attacker does not need network access or direct access to the vulnerable user's system.
- The exploit can only affect the local user that uploads and interacts with the file preview.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.21.0 of the `matrix-react-sdk`.
- The fix involved filtering the MIME type of uploaded files to ensure that they are displayed safely, thus preventing the execution of embedded scripts.
- The pull request that addresses this issue is #5981, which includes commits related to extracting blob-safe MIME types, converting the `UploadConfirmDialog` to TSX, and adjusting the MIME type of the upload confirmation.
- The severity of the vulnerability is considered Low.
