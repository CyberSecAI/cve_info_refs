```
- Root cause of vulnerability: The mod_proxy65 module in Prosody allows open access by default, even if neither of the users have an XMPP account on the local server.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Unrestricted access to the file transfer proxy provided by mod_proxy65. This includes lack of authentication and access controls.
- Impact of exploitation: A remote unauthenticated attacker can use the server's bandwidth by initiating a data stream through the proxy, potentially leading to denial of service.
- Attack vectors: A remote unauthenticated attacker can send requests to the vulnerable server.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs network access to the Prosody server.
