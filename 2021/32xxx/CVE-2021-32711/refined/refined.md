Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-32711:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flaw in the API system that allows for information leakage via the Store-API. The specific mechanism isn't detailed, but the fix involved a non-backward compatible change to the API.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Disclosure:** The core vulnerability is the unintended exposure of potentially sensitive information through the Store-API.
- **API Design Flaw:** The underlying problem lies in how the API was designed and handled data access or visibility.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Leakage:** The primary impact is the unauthorized disclosure of information. The nature of the information isn't specified, but given the context of an e-commerce platform, it could potentially include customer data, order details, or other sensitive business information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Store-API:** The vulnerability is specifically exploited via the Store-API. This implies that an attacker needs to interact with the system through this specific API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Store-API:**  An attacker must have the ability to make requests to the vulnerable Store-API endpoint. This doesn't necessarily mean they need to be an authenticated user, but rather have network access to make such requests.

**Additional Notes:**
- The fix for this vulnerability required a non-backward compatible change to the API, which indicates a significant architectural issue.
- The vendor recommends upgrading to version 6.3.5.1 to address the vulnerability. They also provide a plugin for older versions (6.1 and 6.2) as a workaround, but recommend updating to the latest version for full functionality.
- The issue is described as "critical," highlighting its severity.
- The affected versions are Shopware versions 6.1.0 up to and including 6.3.5.0.
- The provided commit diffs show changes related to the `ApiAware` flag, indicating that the fix involved adjustments to how API access is managed.
