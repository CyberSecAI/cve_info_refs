Based on the provided information, this content is related to **CVE-2021-32615**.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `admin/user_list_backend.php` file, specifically in how the `order[0][dir]` parameter from the request is used to construct the SQL query for ordering results.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The `order[0][dir]` parameter, which dictates the sorting direction (ASC or DESC), is directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper sanitization or validation.
- The code at line 70: `$sOrder .= $aColumns[ $col ].' '.$_REQUEST["order"][0]["dir"].', ';` concatenates the user-controlled input `$_REQUEST["order"][0]["dir"]` directly into the `$sOrder` string, which is later used in the SQL query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code by manipulating the `order[0][dir]` parameter. This could allow them to:
    - Access sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify data in the database.
    - Potentially gain control of the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted HTTP request to `admin/user_list_backend.php`, specifically by manipulating the `order[0][dir]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable `admin/user_list_backend.php` page.
- The attacker does not require any authentication before exploiting this SQL injection.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of the structure of the SQL query.

**Additional details from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was reported by Harry Goodman from NCC Group.
- The fix implemented was to use a regular expression (`preg_match('/^(asc|desc)$/i', $_REQUEST["order"][0]["dir"])`) to validate that the value of `order[0][dir]` is either "asc" or "desc" before using it in the query.
