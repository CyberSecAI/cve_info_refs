# Asymmetric Resource Consumption (Amplification) in Docker containers created by Wings

Moderate

[DaneEveritt](/DaneEveritt)
published
GHSA-jj6m-r8jc-2gp7
Jun 21, 2021

## Package

gomod

wings
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.4.3

## Patched versions

1.4.4

## Description

### Impact

All versions of Pterodactyl Wings preior to `1.4.4` are vulnerable to system resource exhaustion due to improper container process limits being defined. A malicious user can consume more resources than intended and cause downstream impacts to other clients on the same hardware, eventually causing the physical server to stop responding.

### Patches

Users should upgrade to `1.4.4`.

### Workarounds

There is no non-code based workaround for impacted versions of the software. Users running customized versions of this software can manually set a PID limit for containers created.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Contact us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/pterodactyl)
* Email us at `dane ät pterodactyl dot io`

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
