| I'm wanting to understand this more fully as I will admit I'm not fully versed on how to prevent RCE.  What I'm gathering is to get this to run:  You need to:   * Create a blank file (or a php script - with 10MB due to the filesize checking involved?) * making sure the file is accessible (this means some checking we already had in place isn't working properly, would you be willing to test dev-branch and working-1.6 branches which I adjusted the code to hopefully fix this so testing would be awesome. * While this is an issue, it appears you would have to have access to the interface for this to be exploited. (I realize people have this externally accessible sometimes. So I want this fixed of course.) Most people are not immediately impacted? * For number 6, unfortunately I don't think its viable to prevent certain file names. |

| [@mastacontrola](https://github.com/mastacontrola) Interesting. Someone with the pseudonym LaCashita contacted me in the FOG forums chat to report exactly this issue in February this year. To fix this issue I commited (and tested!) [c41006e](https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/commit/c41006e3fca6bf1780e7a65fd504195f1ef87560). I am fairly sure it does prevent from that particular issue reported here.  Now you added [bb4b762](https://github.com/FOGProject/fogproject/commit/bb4b762471dc4dac377735ebe896cd9be185b4a4) which essentially just reverts the logic of the URL check. It's probably easier to comprehend the logic this way so that's good. Though I don't understand why you switched to use `stripos` for one of the URLs only. |

| The only reason I switched to stripos was I was under the impression the checks you are referencing were not working. So I just made the search case insensitive. |

| I think this might be an incomplete fix.  **First,** the filename:  I had a look at a fresh Ubuntu 18.04+Apache installation and found the following in `/etc/apache2/mods-enabled/php7.2.conf`:  ``` <FilesMatch ".+\.ph(ar|p|tml)$">     SetHandler application/x-httpd-php </FilesMatch>  ```  So, in addition to `.php` the same RCE works with `.phar` and `.phtml`. I am also pretty sure I have seen `.php5` etc. before.  I guess using randomly-generated names is not easily possible. But is it possible to forbid suffixes completely? Or alternatively to only allow a list of known suffixes?  **Second,** the URL check:  ``` if (false === stripos($dlUrl, 'https://fogproject.org/') &&     false === stripos($dlUrl, 'https://github.com/FOGProject/')) {     throw new Exception(_('Specified download URL not allowed!')); }  ```  It can likely be circumvented by adding the FOG URL inside the malicious URL, for example:  ``` http://malicous.server/myshell?https://fogproject.org/  ```  I must admit, I have not tested this so there might be some code that prevents this. However, this is easy to fix by switching to `str_starts_with` instead of `stripos`. |

| [@georgschoelly](https://github.com/georgschoelly) Thanks for your input on this!   1. Definitely right, many systems allow other PHP file extensions. So I changed the check on filename to block any filename that has an extension (a dot in the filename). Our kernel files are usually named `bzImage` and people should get along without using a dot! 2. Now that I look at this again I am pretty sure I tried to do exactly this by using `if (!(strpos($dlUrl, 'https://fogproject.org/') === 0))`. Though the logic seems to be a bit backwards I am pretty sure it worked in my tests. Using `str_starts_with` sounds great but we don't use PHP 8 yet. Therefore I think we need to go back to the backwards logic I used earlier. |
