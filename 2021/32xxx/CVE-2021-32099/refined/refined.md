  "content": "Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described, which corresponds to CVE-2021-32099:\n\n**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**\nThe root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability due to the failure to properly sanitize user input within the `PandoraFMS\\User` class constructor. Specifically, the code directly uses the `$_REQUEST['session_id']` parameter to build a SQL query without sanitization. This parameter may contain GET, POST, or cookie values.\n\n**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**\n*   **SQL Injection:**  The most severe vulnerability identified is a pre-authentication SQL injection flaw. Attackers can manipulate the SQL queries performed by the application by supplying malicious content in the session ID, allowing them to bypass authentication and perform unauthorized actions.\n*   **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The code uses `$_REQUEST` to fetch parameters, combining GET, POST and cookie values. Also, the code fails to sanitize input passed to the  `PandoraFMS\\User` class constructor and directly uses this untrusted input in a SQL query.\n*   **Deserealization vulnerability:** The function `session_decode()` is used to load session data from the results of the SQL query, where an attacker can control the data and deserialize arbitrary objects via SQL injection.  \n*   **Missing or insufficient input sanitization:** The `io_safe_input()` sanitization function, while implemented, is not used consistently. Direct access to `$_GET` and `$_POST` variables, which are not sanitized, is still present in the code. Also, the sanitization function doesn't cover all attack vectors like SQL Injection. \n\n**Impact of Exploitation:**\n*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can completely bypass the administrator authentication, gaining unauthorized access to the application.\n*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the SQL injection, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the system. This is achieved by impersonating an administrator and using features to execute code on the server.\n*   **Full System Compromise:** Attackers can compromise the entire Pandora FMS application and the network systems it monitors.\n\n**Attack Vectors:**\n*   **Direct exploitation via browser:** Attackers can craft malicious requests containing SQL injection payloads to exploit the application directly if they can reach a Pandora FMS server.\n*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited through a CSRF attack, where a user visiting a malicious website unknowingly triggers a request on their browser to the vulnerable Pandora FMS server. This requires no prior user authentication or privileges. This also applies to Pandora FMS instances directly exposed to the internet.\n\n**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**\n*   **No prior knowledge or specific configurations are needed:**  The attacker requires no prior knowledge of a target system or specific configuration to launch an attack.\n*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Pandora FMS server, whether directly or through an unsuspecting user's browser.\n*   **Ability to craft malicious payloads:** The attacker needs to be able to generate SQL injection payloads to bypass authentication and execute commands.\n\n**Additional details:**\n* The vulnerability was found in Pandora FMS version 742 and patched in version 743.\n* The vulnerable code resides in `/include/chart_generator.php`, `/include/lib/User.php`, and `/include/lib/mysql.php`.\n*  A proof-of-concept (PoC) video exists, demonstrating how a server can be quickly compromised.\n*  The researchers chose not to disclose the exact method of exploitation due to the severity of the vulnerability.\n*  Several Pandora FMS instances were found to be exposed to the internet, increasing the risk of exploitation.\n\n\n",
