    "description": "postgresql: Buffer overrun from integer overflow in array subscripting calculations (CVE-2021-32027)",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from missing bounds checks in array subscripting calculations, where the combination of lower bounds and array dimensions could lead to an integer overflow. This overflow can cause array assignment logic to access memory outside the allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overrun.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Buffer Overflow",
     "Missing bounds check"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to memory corruption, which could allow disclosure of sensitive information, arbitrary code execution, or denial of service (DoS) attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": "An authenticated database user can trigger this vulnerability by modifying SQL array values in a specific manner.",
    "required_capabilities": "Requires an authenticated user with the ability to modify SQL array values in a specific manner."
