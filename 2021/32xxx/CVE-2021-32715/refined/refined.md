{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `hyper` HTTP/1 server incorrectly parses and accepts requests with a `Content-Length` header prefixed with a plus sign, which should have been rejected according to RFC 7230. This is due to using the `FromStr` implementation for `u64` in the standard library, which allows a leading '+'.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CWE-444: Inconsistent Interpretation of HTTP Requests"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability can lead to 'request smuggling' or 'desync attacks'. An upstream proxy might forward the invalid `Content-Length` header (with the plus sign) to the `hyper` server, causing the proxy and server to disagree on the length of the request body. This allows attackers to inject malicious payloads by manipulating the interpretation of message boundaries.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker sends a crafted HTTP/1 request with a `Content-Length` header prefixed with a plus sign to a vulnerable `hyper` server via a vulnerable upstream HTTP proxy. The proxy must not reject the request with the invalid `Content-Length` header and must forward it as-is.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to a vulnerable `hyper` server through an upstream proxy that does not properly validate or reject the plus sign prefix in the Content-Length header, and forwards the request as-is."
