The provided content is related to CVE-2021-32288.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A global-buffer-overflow in `hevcdecoderconfigrecord.cpp` at line 317.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
A global-buffer-overflow vulnerability exists in the `HevcDecoderConfigurationRecord::getPicHeight()` function. The overflow occurs when reading data at an address that is outside the bounds of the allocated memory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The vulnerability can lead to a crash of the application due to the read access violation. As the vulnerability is a global-buffer-overflow, it may also lead to other more serious consequences such as arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted HEIF file that causes the `getPicHeight()` function to read out of bounds. The vulnerability can be triggered by supplying a malicious file to the affected application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious HEIF file that is processed by a vulnerable application.
