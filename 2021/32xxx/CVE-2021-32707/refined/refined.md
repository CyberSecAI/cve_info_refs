Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The Nextcloud Mail application failed to properly sanitize CSS style sheets in emails, specifically `url(...)` values within CSS. The application's privacy filter, designed to block images by default to prevent read state leaks, was bypassed by images loaded via `background-image` CSS attributes. The original style attribute sanitizer was not strict enough, failing to handle all url() values.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application did not sanitize CSS style sheets thoroughly, allowing arbitrary URLs to be loaded via CSS `url()` functions.
*   **CSS Injection:** Attackers could inject malicious CSS containing URLs to load external images, bypassing the intended image blocking mechanism.
*   **Bypass of Privacy Filter:** The privacy filter designed to prevent email tracking was bypassed by using background-image CSS properties to load images.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially track when an email was opened by loading an image from a server under their control when the email is viewed by the victim.
*   While the images were proxied there was no IP address leakage.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Injection:** An attacker sends a crafted HTML email with malicious CSS.
*   **CSS `url()` Function:** Malicious URLs are included within the `url()` function in the CSS style sheets, especially within the `background-image` attributes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send emails to users of the vulnerable Nextcloud Mail application.
*   The attacker does not need any special privileges or access to the Nextcloud server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Nextcloud Mail versions prior to 1.9.6 and 1.10.0.
*   The fix involves sanitizing all `url()` values in CSS style sheets using a new PHP dependency for parsing CSS.
*   The fix also includes improvements to the style attribute sanitizer.
*   The images are loaded through the nextcloud image proxy, so there is no direct IP leakage to the attacker's server.
*   The vulnerability is categorized as low severity.
*   The issue was reported through HackerOne.

**CWEs:**

*   CWE-20: Improper Input Validation
*   CWE-200: Information Exposure
