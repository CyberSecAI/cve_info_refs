# Bypass of image blocking in Nextcloud Mail

Low

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-xxp4-44xc-8crh
Jul 12, 2021

## Package

Nextcloud Mail

## Affected versions

< 1.9.6, < 1.10.0

## Patched versions

1.9.6, 1.10.0

## Description

### Impact

The Nextcloud Mail application does by default not render images in emails to not leak the read state. The privacy filter failed to filter images with a `background-image` CSS attribute.

Note that the images were still passed through the Nextcloud image proxy, and thus there was no IP leakage.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Mail application is upgraded to 1.9.6 or 1.10.0

### Workarounds

None.

### @st3iny **[st3iny](/st3iny)** commented [Jun 16, 2021](#issue-922373424)

Currently, CSS style sheets are not sanitized and allow tracker scripts to bypass our trusted senders feature. Furthermore, our style attribute sanitizer was not strict enough so I improved it to replace all `url(...)` values (not just those of `background-*` rules).

I added a new PHP dependency for parsing CSS style sheets. Using regex is not sufficient to parse style sheets and could be exploited by a future attacker.

## Example

```
ul { list-style-image: url(https://my.tracker.com/some-image.png); }
div { background-image: url(https://my.tracker.com/some-image.png); }
```

Sorry, something went wrong.

I haven't tested this, but could I use this to bypass any other kind of sanitization we may be running on the HTML?

As in: what if someone sends an email that has something like:

```
<span data-original-content="<img src=&quot;doesnotexist&quot; onerror=&quot;alert(1)&quot;">

```

Or don't we have any kind of sanitization anymore regardless as we sandbox the iframe?

Sorry, something went wrong.

The selector only selects `style` elements with the attribute `data-original-content` so your example won't have any effect.

Nevertheless, an attacker could send a forged style tag containing some malicious content but our sanitation extracts, merges and then sanitizes all style sheets at once so theoretically this shouldn't be exploitable. The rendered html email will only have one `style` element right at the beginning.

Sorry, something went wrong.
