PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEC INS (Infrastructure Network Services) is a web-based application that combines various network
services in one tool. This simpliﬁes installation and administration of all network services relevant for
industrial networks.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

Vulnerability CVE-2020-1971

The X.509 GeneralName type is a generic type for representing different types of names. One of those
name types is known as EDIPartyName. OpenSSL provides a function GENERAL_NAME_cmp which
compares different instances of a GENERAL_NAME to see if they are equal or not. This function
behaves incorrectly when both GENERAL_NAMEs contain an EDIPARTYNAME. A NULL pointer
dereference and a crash may occur leading to a possible denial of service attack. OpenSSL itself uses
the GENERAL_NAME_cmp function for two purposes: 1) Comparing CRL distribution point names
between an available CRL and a CRL distribution point embedded in an X509 certiﬁcate 2) When
verifying that a timestamp response token signer matches the timestamp authority name (exposed via
the API functions TS_RESP_verify_response and TS_RESP_verify_token) If an attacker can control
both items being compared then that attacker could trigger a crash. For example if the attacker can
trick a client or server into checking a malicious certiﬁcate against a malicious CRL then this may occur.
Note that some applications automatically download CRLs based on a URL embedded in a certiﬁcate.
This checking happens prior to the signatures on the certiﬁcate and CRL being veriﬁed. OpenSSL’s
s_server, s_client and verify tools have support for the “-crl_download” option which implements
automatic CRL downloading and this attack has been demonstrated to work against those tools. Note
that an unrelated bug means that affected versions of OpenSSL cannot parse or construct correct
encodings of EDIPARTYNAME. However it is possible to construct a malformed EDIPARTYNAME that
OpenSSL’s parser will accept and hence trigger this attack. All OpenSSL 1.1.1 and 1.0.2 versions are
affected by this issue. Other OpenSSL releases are out of support and have not been checked. Fixed
in OpenSSL 1.1.1i (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1h). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.0.2x (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2w).

Vulnerability CVE-2020-8625

BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected version and are conﬁgured to use GSS-
TSIG features. In a conﬁguration which uses BIND’s default settings the vulnerable code path is
not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly setting valid values for the tkey-
gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credentialconﬁguration options. Although the default conﬁguration is not
vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND is integrated with Samba, as well
as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with Active Directory domain controllers.
The most likely outcome of a successful exploitation of the vulnerability is a crash of the named
process. However, remote code execution, while unproven, is theoretically possible. Affects: BIND
9.5.0 -> 9.11.27, 9.12.0 -> 9.16.11, and versions BIND 9.11.3-S1 -> 9.11.27-S1 and 9.16.8-S1 ->

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3450

The X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT ﬂag enables additional security checks of the certiﬁcates present
in a certiﬁcate chain.
It is not set by default. Starting from OpenSSL version 1.1.1h a check to
disallow certiﬁcates in the chain that have explicitly encoded elliptic curve parameters was added
as an additional strict check. An error in the implementation of this check meant that the result of a
previous check to conﬁrm that certiﬁcates in the chain are valid CA certiﬁcates was overwritten. This
effectively bypasses the check that non-CA certiﬁcates must not be able to issue other certiﬁcates. If a
“purpose” has been conﬁgured then there is a subsequent opportunity for checks that the certiﬁcate is
a valid CA. All of the named “purpose” values implemented in libcrypto perform this check. Therefore,
where a purpose is set the certiﬁcate chain will still be rejected even when the strict ﬂag has been
used. A purpose is set by default in libssl client and server certiﬁcate veriﬁcation routines, but it can
be overridden or removed by an application. In order to be affected, an application must explicitly
set the X509_V_FLAG_X509_STRICT veriﬁcation ﬂag and either not set a purpose for the certiﬁcate
veriﬁcation or, in the case of TLS client or server applications, override the default purpose. OpenSSL
versions 1.1.1h and newer are affected by this issue. Users of these versions should upgrade to
OpenSSL 1.1.1k. OpenSSL 1.0.2 is not impacted by this issue. Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1k (Affected

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3711

In order to decrypt SM2 encrypted data an application is expected to call the API function
EVP_PKEY_decrypt(). Typically an application will call this function twice. The ﬁrst time, on en-
try, the “out” parameter can be NULL and, on exit, the “outlen” parameter is populated with the buffer
size required to hold the decrypted plaintext. The application can then allocate a sufﬁciently sized
buffer and call EVP_PKEY_decrypt() again, but this time passing a non-NULL value for the “out”
parameter. A bug in the implementation of the SM2 decryption code means that the calculation of
the buffer size required to hold the plaintext returned by the ﬁrst call to EVP_PKEY_decrypt() can
be smaller than the actual size required by the second call. This can lead to a buffer overﬂow when
EVP_PKEY_decrypt() is called by the application a second time with a buffer that is too small. A
malicious attacker who is able present SM2 content for decryption to an application could cause
attacker chosen data to overﬂow the buffer by up to a maximum of 62 bytes altering the contents of
other data held after the buffer, possibly changing application behaviour or causing the application
to crash. The location of the buffer is application dependent but is typically heap allocated. Fixed in

Vulnerability CVE-2021-3712

ASN.1 strings are represented internally within OpenSSL as an ASN1_STRING structure which
contains a buffer holding the string data and a ﬁeld holding the buffer length. This contrasts with
normal C strings which are repesented as a buffer for the string data which is terminated with a NUL
(0) byte. Although not a strict requirement, ASN.1 strings that are parsed using OpenSSL’s own “d2i”
functions (and other similar parsing functions) as well as any string whose value has been set with the
ASN1_STRING_set() function will additionally NUL terminate the byte array in the ASN1_STRING
structure. However, it is possible for applications to directly construct valid ASN1_STRING structures
which do not NUL terminate the byte array by directly setting the “data” and “length” ﬁelds in the
ASN1_STRING array. This can also happen by using the ASN1_STRING_set0() function. Numerous
OpenSSL functions that print ASN.1 data have been found to assume that the ASN1_STRING
byte array will be NUL terminated, even though this is not guaranteed for strings that have been
directly constructed. Where an application requests an ASN.1 structure to be printed, and where
that ASN.1 structure contains ASN1_STRINGs that have been directly constructed by the application
without NUL terminating the “data” ﬁeld, then a read buffer overrun can occur. The same thing can
also occur during name constraints processing of certiﬁcates (for example if a certiﬁcate has been
directly constructed by the application instead of loading it via the OpenSSL parsing functions, and
the certiﬁcate contains non NUL terminated ASN1_STRING structures).
It can also occur in the
X509_get1_email(), X509_REQ_get1_email() and X509_get1_ocsp() functions. If a malicious actor
can cause an application to directly construct an ASN1_STRING and then process it through one of
the affected OpenSSL functions then this issue could be hit. This might result in a crash (causing
a Denial of Service attack). It could also result in the disclosure of private memory contents (such
as private keys, or sensitive plaintext). Fixed in OpenSSL 1.1.1l (Affected 1.1.1-1.1.1k). Fixed in
OpenSSL 1.0.2za (Affected 1.0.2-1.0.2y).

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22901

curl 7.75.0 through 7.76.1 suffers from a use-after-free vulnerability resulting in already freed memory
being used when a TLS 1.3 session ticket arrives over a connection. A malicious server can use
this in rare unfortunate circumstances to potentially reach remote code execution in the client. When
libcurl at run-time sets up support for TLS 1.3 session tickets on a connection using OpenSSL, it
stores pointers to the transfer in-memory object for later retrieval when a session ticket arrives. If
the connection is used by multiple transfers (like with a reused HTTP/1.1 connection or multiplexed
HTTP/2 connection) that ﬁrst transfer object might be freed before the new session is established on
that connection and then the function will access a memory buffer that might be freed. When using
that memory, libcurl might even call a function pointer in the object, making it possible for a remote
code execution if the server could somehow manage to get crafted memory content into the correct
place in memory.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22923

When curl is instructed to get content using the metalink feature, and a user name and password are
used to download the metalink XML ﬁle, those same credentials are then subsequently passed on to
each of the servers from which curl will download or try to download the contents from. Often contrary
to the user’s expectations and intentions and without telling the user it happened.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22924

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse, if
one of them matches the setup. Due to errors in the logic, the conﬁg matching function did not take
‘issuercert’ into account and it compared the involved paths case insensitively,which could lead to
libcurl reusing wrong connections. File paths are, or can be, case sensitive on many systems but not
all, and can even vary depending on used ﬁle systems. The comparison also didn’t include the ‘issuer
cert’ which a transfer can set to qualify how to verify the server certiﬁcate.

curl supports the -t command line option, known as CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONSin libcurl. This rarely
used option is used to send variable=content pairs toTELNET servers.Due to ﬂaw in the option parser
for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurlcould be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based
buffer to theserver. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to theserver using
a clear-text network protocol.This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly
whenparsing the string provided by the application.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22926

libcurl-using applications can ask for a speciﬁc client certiﬁcate to be used in a transfer. This is done
with the CURLOPT_SSLCERT option (--cert with the command line tool).When libcurl is built to use the
macOS native TLS library Secure Transport, an application can ask for the client certiﬁcate by name
or with a ﬁle name - using the same option. If the name exists as a ﬁle, it will be used instead of by
name.If the appliction runs with a current working directory that is writable by other users (like /tmp), a
malicious user can create a ﬁle name with the same name as the app wants to use by name, and
thereby trick the application to use the ﬁle based cert instead of the one referred to by name making
libcurl send the wrong client certiﬁcate in the TLS connection handshake.

the BIND 9.17 development branch, BIND servers are vulnerable if they are running an affected
version and are conﬁgured to use GSS-TSIG features. In a conﬁguration which uses BIND’s default
settings the vulnerable code path is not exposed, but a server can be rendered vulnerable by explicitly
setting values for the tkey-gssapi-keytab or tkey-gssapi-credential conﬁguration options. Although
the default conﬁguration is not vulnerable, GSS-TSIG is frequently used in networks where BIND
is integrated with Samba, as well as in mixed-server environments that combine BIND servers with
Active Directory domain controllers. For servers that meet these conditions, the ISC SPNEGO
implementation is vulnerable to various attacks, depending on the CPU architecture for which BIND
was built: For named binaries compiled for 64-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can be used to trigger a buffer
over-read, leading to a server crash. For named binaries compiled for 32-bit platforms, this ﬂaw can
be used to trigger a server crash due to a buffer overﬂow and possibly also to achieve remote code
execution. We have determined that standard SPNEGO implementations are available in the MIT and
Heimdal Kerberos libraries, which support a broad range of operating systems, rendering the ISC
implementation unnecessary and obsolete. Therefore, to reduce the attack surface for BIND users,
we will be removing the ISC SPNEGO implementation in the April releases of BIND 9.11 and 9.16 (it
had already been dropped from BIND 9.17). We would not normally remove something from a stable
ESV (Extended Support Version) of BIND, but since system libraries can replace the ISC SPNEGO
implementation, we have made an exception in this case for reasons of stability and security.

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.2, 5.0.7, 4.4.15, and 3.2.3 has an arbitrary
File Creation/Overwrite vulnerability via insufﬁcient symlink protection. node-tar aims to guarantee
that any ﬁle whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part,
achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent
unnecessary stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when
directories are created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a
directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the
directory being created and added to the node-tar directory cache. When a directory is present in the
directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where
node-tar checks for symlinks occur. By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory
with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially
allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary
ﬁles into that location, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 6.1.1, 5.0.6, 4.4.14, and 3.3.2 has a arbitrary File
Creation/Overwrite vulnerability due to insufﬁcient absolute path sanitization. node-tar aims to prevent
extraction of absolute ﬁle paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the preservePaths
ﬂag is not set to true. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute ﬁle paths
contained in a tar ﬁle. For example /home/user/.bashrc would turn into home/user/.bashrc. This
logic was insufﬁcient when ﬁle paths contained repeated path roots such as ////home/user/.bashrc.
node-tar would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute ﬁle path with
repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. ///home/user/.bashrc) would still resolve to an absolute
path, thus allowing arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.2,
4.4.14, 5.0.6 and 6.1.1. Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a
custom onentry method which sanitizes the entry.path or a filter method which removes entries
with absolute paths. See referenced GitHub Advisory for details. Be aware of CVE-2021-32803 which

creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be modiﬁed by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by
ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary
stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are
created. This logic was insufﬁcient when extracting tar ﬁles that contained both a directory and a
symlink with the same name as the directory, where the symlink and directory names in the archive
entry used backslashes as a path separator on posix systems. The cache checking logic used both
\ and / characters as path separators, however \ is a valid ﬁlename character on posix systems.
By ﬁrst creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to
bypass node-tar symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar ﬁle to symlink
into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary ﬁles into that location, thus allowing
arbitrary ﬁle creation and overwrite. Additionally, a similar confusion could arise on case-insensitive
ﬁlesystems. If a tar archive contained a directory at FOO, followed by a symbolic link named foo, then
on case-insensitive ﬁle systems, the creation of the symbolic link would remove the directory from
the ﬁlesystem, but not from the internal directory cache, as it would not be treated as a cache hit.
A subsequent ﬁle entry within the FOO directory would then be placed in the target of the symbolic
link, thinking that the directory had already been created. These issues were addressed in releases
4.4.16, 5.0.8 and 6.1.7. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches

stat calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are

The npm package “tar” (aka node-tar) before versions 4.4.18, 5.0.10, and 6.1.9 has an arbitrary ﬁle
creation/overwrite and arbitrary code execution vulnerability. node-tar aims to guarantee that any ﬁle
whose location would be outside of the extraction target directory is not extracted. This is, in part,
accomplished by sanitizing absolute paths of entries within the archive, skipping archive entries that
contain .. path portions, and resolving the sanitized paths against the extraction target directory. This
logic was insufﬁcient on Windows systems when extracting tar ﬁles that contained a path that was not
an absolute path, but speciﬁed a drive letter different from the extraction target, such as C:some\path.
If the drive letter does not match the extraction target, for example D:\extraction\dir, then the result
of path.resolve(extractionDirectory, entryPath) would resolve against the current working
directory on the C: drive, rather than the extraction target directory. Additionally, a .. portion of the
path could occur immediately after the drive letter, such as C:../foo, and was not properly sanitized
by the logic that checked for .. within the normalized and split portions of the path. This only affects
users of node-tar on Windows systems. These issues were addressed in releases 4.4.18, 5.0.10 and
6.1.9. The v3 branch of node-tar has been deprecated and did not receive patches for these issues.
If you are still using a v3 release we recommend you update to a more recent version of node-tar.
There is no reasonable way to work around this issue without performing the same path normalization
procedures that node-tar now does. Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patched versions
of node-tar, rather than attempt to sanitize paths themselves.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-39134

@npmcli/arborist, the library that calculates dependency trees and manages the node_modules
folder hierarchy for the npm command line interface, aims to guarantee that package dependency con-
tracts will be met, and the extraction of package contents will always be performed into the expected
folder. This is, in part, accomplished by resolving dependency speciﬁers deﬁned in package.json man-
ifests for dependencies with a speciﬁc name, and nesting folders to resolve conﬂicting dependencies.
When multiple dependencies differ only in the case of their name, Arborist’s internal data structure saw
them as separate items that could coexist within the same level in the node_modules hierarchy. How-
ever, on case-insensitive ﬁle systems (such as macOS and Windows), this is not the case. Combined
with a symlink dependency such as file:/some/path, this allowed an attacker to create a situation in
which arbitrary contents could be written to any location on the ﬁlesystem. For example, a package
pwn-a could deﬁne a dependency in their package.json ﬁle such as "foo": "file:/some/path". An-
other package, pwn-b could deﬁne a dependency such as FOO: "file:foo.tgz". On case-insensitive
ﬁle systems, if pwn-a was installed, and then pwn-b was installed afterwards, the contents of foo.tgz
would be written to /some/path, and any existing contents of /some/path would be removed. Anyone
using npm v7.20.6 or earlier on a case-insensitive ﬁlesystem is potentially affected. This is patched in
@npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above.

expected folder. This is accomplished by extracting package contents into a project’s node_modules
folder. If the node_modules folder of the root project or any of its dependencies is somehow replaced
with a symbolic link, it could allow Arborist to write package dependencies to any arbitrary location on
the ﬁle system. Note that symbolic links contained within package artifact contents are ﬁltered out, so
another means of creating a node_modules symbolic link would have to be employed. 1. A preinstall
script could replace node_modules with a symlink. (This is prevented by using --ignore-scripts.)
2. An attacker could supply the target with a git repository, instructing them to run npm install
--ignore-scripts in the root. This may be successful, because npm install --ignore-scripts is
typically not capable of making changes outside of the project directory, so it may be deemed safe.
This is patched in @npmcli/arborist 2.8.2 which is included in npm v7.20.7 and above. For more
information including workarounds please see the referenced GHSA-gmw6-94gg-2rc2.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

## Package

npm

tar
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

>= 4.0.0, < 4.4.15
>= 5.0.0, < 5.0.7
>= 6.0.0, < 6.1.2
>= 3.0.0, < 3.2.3

## Patched versions

4.4.15
5.0.7
6.1.2
3.2.3

## Description

### Impact

Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.

This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur.

By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.

### Patches

3.2.3 || 4.4.15 || 5.0.7 || 6.1.2

### Workarounds

Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `filter` method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.

```
const tar = require('tar')

tar.x({
  file: 'archive.tgz',
  filter: (file, entry) => {
    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {
      return false
    } else {
      return true
    }
  }
})
```

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.

Fast and full-featured Tar for Node.js

The API is designed to mimic the behavior of `tar(1)` on unix systems.
If you are familiar with how tar works, most of this will hopefully be
straightforward for you. If not, then hopefully this module can teach
you useful unix skills that may come in handy someday :)

## Background

A "tar file" or "tarball" is an archive of file system entries
(directories, files, links, etc.) The name comes from "tape archive".
If you run `man tar` on almost any Unix command line, you'll learn
quite a bit about what it can do, and its history.

Tar has 5 main top-level commands:

* `c` Create an archive
* `r` Replace entries within an archive
* `u` Update entries within an archive (ie, replace if they're newer)
* `t` List out the contents of an archive
* `x` Extract an archive to disk

The other flags and options modify how this top level function works.

## High-Level API

These 5 functions are the high-level API. All of them have a
single-character name (for unix nerds familiar with `tar(1)`) as well
as a long name (for everyone else).

All the high-level functions take the following arguments, all three
of which are optional and may be omitted.

1. `options` - An optional object specifying various options
2. `paths` - An array of paths to add or extract
3. `callback` - Called when the command is completed, if async. (If
   sync or no file specified, providing a callback throws a
   `TypeError`.)

If the command is sync (ie, if `options.sync=true`), then the
callback is not allowed, since the action will be completed immediately.

If a `file` argument is specified, and the command is async, then a
`Promise` is returned. In this case, if async, a callback may be
provided which is called when the command is completed.

If a `file` option is not specified, then a stream is returned. For
`create`, this is a readable stream of the generated archive. For
`list` and `extract` this is a writable stream that an archive should
be written into. If a file is not specified, then a callback is not
allowed, because you're already getting a stream to work with.

`replace` and `update` only work on existing archives, and so require
a `file` argument.

Sync commands without a file argument return a stream that acts on its
input immediately in the same tick. For readable streams, this means
that all of the data is immediately available by calling
`stream.read()`. For writable streams, it will be acted upon as soon
as it is provided, but this can be at any time.

### Warnings and Errors

Tar emits warnings and errors for recoverable and unrecoverable situations,
respectively. In many cases, a warning only affects a single entry in an
archive, or is simply informing you that it's modifying an entry to comply
with the settings provided.

Unrecoverable warnings will always raise an error (ie, emit `'error'` on
streaming actions, throw for non-streaming sync actions, reject the
returned Promise for non-streaming async operations, or call a provided
callback with an `Error` as the first argument). Recoverable errors will
raise an error only if `strict: true` is set in the options.

Respond to (recoverable) warnings by listening to the `warn` event.
Handlers receive 3 arguments:

* `code` String. One of the error codes below. This may not match
  `data.code`, which preserves the original error code from fs and zlib.
* `message` String. More details about the error.
* `data` Metadata about the error. An `Error` object for errors raised by
  fs and zlib. All fields are attached to errors raisd by tar. Typically
  contains the following fields, as relevant:
  + `tarCode` The tar error code.
  + `code` Either the tar error code, or the error code set by the
    underlying system.
  + `file` The archive file being read or written.
  + `cwd` Working directory for creation and extraction operations.
  + `entry` The entry object (if it could be created) for `TAR_ENTRY_INFO`,
    `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID`, and `TAR_ENTRY_ERROR` warnings.
  + `header` The header object (if it could be created, and the entry could
    not be created) for `TAR_ENTRY_INFO` and `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID` warnings.
  + `recoverable` Boolean. If `false`, then the warning will emit an
    `error`, even in non-strict mode.

#### Error Codes

* `TAR_ENTRY_INFO` An informative error indicating that an entry is being
  modified, but otherwise processed normally. For example, removing `/` or
  `C:\` from absolute paths if `preservePaths` is not set.
* `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID` An indication that a given entry is not a valid tar
  archive entry, and will be skipped. This occurs when:

  + a checksum fails,
  + a `linkpath` is missing for a link type, or
  + a `linkpath` is provided for a non-link type.

  If every entry in a parsed archive raises an `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID` error,
  then the archive is presumed to be unrecoverably broken, and
  `TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE` will be raised.
* `TAR_ENTRY_ERROR` The entry appears to be a valid tar archive entry, but
  encountered an error which prevented it from being unpacked. This occurs
  when:

  + an unrecoverable fs error happens during unpacking,
  + an entry is trying to extract into an excessively deep
    location (by default, limited to 1024 subfolders),
  + an entry has `..` in the path and `preservePaths` is not set, or
  + an entry is extracting through a symbolic link, when `preservePaths` is
    not set.
* `TAR_ENTRY_UNSUPPORTED` An indication that a given entry is
  a valid archive entry, but of a type that is unsupported, and so will be
  skipped in archive creation or extracting.
* `TAR_ABORT` When parsing gzipped-encoded archives, the parser will
  abort the parse process raise a warning for any zlib errors encountered.
  Aborts are considered unrecoverable for both parsing and unpacking.
* `TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE` The archive file is totally hosed. This can happen for
  a number of reasons, and always occurs at the end of a parse or extract:

  + An entry body was truncated before seeing the full number of bytes.
  + The archive contained only invalid entries, indicating that it is
    likely not an archive, or at least, not an archive this library can
    parse.

  `TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE` is considered informative for parse operations, but
  unrecoverable for extraction. Note that, if encountered at the end of an
  extraction, tar WILL still have extracted as much it could from the
  archive, so there may be some garbage files to clean up.

Errors that occur deeper in the system (ie, either the filesystem or zlib)
will have their error codes left intact, and a `tarCode` matching one of
the above will be added to the warning metadata or the raised error object.

Errors generated by tar will have one of the above codes set as the
`error.code` field as well, but since errors originating in zlib or fs will
have their original codes, it's better to read `error.tarCode` if you wish
to see how tar is handling the issue.

### Examples

The API mimics the `tar(1)` command line functionality, with aliases
for more human-readable option and function names. The goal is that
if you know how to use `tar(1)` in Unix, then you know how to use
`import('tar')` in JavaScript.

To replicate `tar czf my-tarball.tgz files and folders`, you'd do:

```
import { create } from 'tar'
create(
  {
    gzip: <true|gzip options>,
    file: 'my-tarball.tgz'
  },
  ['some', 'files', 'and', 'folders']
).then(_ => { .. tarball has been created .. })
```

To replicate `tar cz files and folders > my-tarball.tgz`, you'd do:

```
// if you're familiar with the tar(1) cli flags, this can be nice
import * as tar from 'tar'
tar.c(
  {
    // 'z' is alias for 'gzip' option
    z: <true|gzip options>
  },
  ['some', 'files', 'and', 'folders']
).pipe(fs.createWriteStream('my-tarball.tgz'))
```

To replicate `tar xf my-tarball.tgz` you'd do:

```
tar.x( // or `tar.extract`
  {
    // or `file:`
    f: 'my-tarball.tgz'
  }
).then(_=> { .. tarball has been dumped in cwd .. })
```

To replicate `cat my-tarball.tgz | tar x -C some-dir --strip=1`:

```
fs.createReadStream('my-tarball.tgz').pipe(
  tar.x({
    strip: 1,
    C: 'some-dir', // alias for cwd:'some-dir', also ok
  }),
)
```

To replicate `tar tf my-tarball.tgz`, do this:

```
tar.t({
  file: 'my-tarball.tgz',
  onReadEntry: entry => { .. do whatever with it .. }
})
```

For example, to just get the list of filenames from an archive:

```
const getEntryFilenames = async tarballFilename => {
  const filenames = []
  await tar.t({
    file: tarballFilename,
    onReadEntry: entry => filenames.push(entry.path),
  })
  return filenames
}
```

To replicate `cat my-tarball.tgz | tar t` do:

```
fs.createReadStream('my-tarball.tgz')
  .pipe(tar.t())
  .on('entry', entry => { .. do whatever with it .. })
```

To do anything synchronous, add `sync: true` to the options. Note
that sync functions don't take a callback and don't return a promise.
When the function returns, it's already done. Sync methods without a
file argument return a sync stream, which flushes immediately. But,
of course, it still won't be done until you `.end()` it.

```
const getEntryFilenamesSync = tarballFilename => {
  const filenames = []
  tar.t({
    file: tarballFilename,
    onReadEntry: entry => filenames.push(entry.path),
    sync: true,
  })
  return filenames
}
```

To filter entries, add `filter: <function>` to the options.
Tar-creating methods call the filter with `filter(path, stat)`.
Tar-reading methods (including extraction) call the filter with
`filter(path, entry)`. The filter is called in the `this`-context of
the `Pack` or `Unpack` stream object.

The arguments list to `tar t` and `tar x` specify a list of filenames
to extract or list, so they're equivalent to a filter that tests if
the file is in the list.

For those who *aren't* fans of tar's single-character command names:

```
tar.c === tar.create
tar.r === tar.replace (appends to archive, file is required)
tar.u === tar.update (appends if newer, file is required)
tar.x === tar.extract
tar.t === tar.list

```

Keep reading for all the command descriptions and options, as well as
the low-level API that they are built on.

### tar.c(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.create]

Create a tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a
directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in `fileList` that starts with an `@` symbol is a tar archive
whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with `@`,
prepend it with `./`.

The following options are supported:

* `file` Write the tarball archive to the specified filename. If this
  is specified, then the callback will be fired when the file has been
  written, and a promise will be returned that resolves when the file
  is written. If a filename is not specified, then a Readable Stream
  will be returned which will emit the file data. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file
  will be fully written after the call to `tar.c`. If this is set,
  and a file is not provided, then the resulting stream will already
  have the data ready to `read` or `emit('data')` as soon as you
  request it.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `cwd` The current working directory for creating the archive.
  Defaults to `process.cwd()`. [Alias: `C`]
* `prefix` A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
* `gzip` Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an
  object with settings for `zlib.Gzip()` [Alias: `z`]
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, stat)` for each
  entry being added. Return `true` to add the entry to the archive,
  or `false` to omit it.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths. [Alias: `P`]
* `mode` The mode to set on the created file archive
* `noDirRecurse` Do not recursively archive the contents of
  directories. [Alias: `n`]
* `follow` Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without
  this option, symbolic links are archived as such. [Alias: `L`, `h`]
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
  [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `mtime` Set to a `Date` object to force a specific `mtime` for
  everything added to the archive. Overridden by `noMtime`.
* `onWriteEntry` Called with each `WriteEntry` or
  `WriteEntrySync` that is created in the course of writing the
  archive.

The following options are mostly internal, but can be modified in some
advanced use cases, such as re-using caches between runs.

* `linkCache` A Map object containing the device and inode value for
  any file whose nlink is > 1, to identify hard links.
* `statCache` A Map object that caches calls `lstat`.
* `readdirCache` A Map object that caches calls to `readdir`.
* `jobs` A number specifying how many concurrent jobs to run.
  Defaults to 4.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.

#### Using `onWriteMethod` to alter entries

The `onWriteMethod` function, if provided, will get a reference
to each `entry` object on its way into the archive.

If any fields on this entry are changed, then these changes will
be reflected in the entry that is written to the archive.

The return value of the method is ignored. All that matters is
the final state of the entry object. This can also be used to
track the files added to an archive, for example.

```
import * as tar from 'tar'
const filesAdded = []
tar.c({
  sync: true,
  file: 'lowercase-executable.tar',
  onWriteEntry(entry) {
    // initially, it's uppercase and 0o644
    console.log('adding', entry.path, entry.stat.mode.toString(8))
    // make all the paths lowercase
    entry.path = entry.path.toLowerCase()
    // make the entry executable
    entry.stat.mode = 0o755
    // in the archive, it's lowercase and 0o755
    filesAdded.push([entry.path, entry.stat.mode.toString(8)])
  },
}, ['./bin'])
console.log('added', filesAdded)
```

Then, if the `./bin` directory contained `SOME-BIN`, it would
show up in the archive as:

```
$ node create-lowercase-executable.js
adding ./bin/SOME-BIN 644
added [[ './bin/some-bin', '755' ]]

$ tar cvf lowercase-executable.tar
-rwxr-xr-x  0 isaacs 20      47731 Aug 14 08:56 ./bin/some-bin

```

with a lowercase name and a mode of `0o755`.

### tar.x(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.extract]

Extract a tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to extract from the tarball. If
no paths are provided, then all the entries are extracted.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

Note that all directories that are created will be forced to be
writable, readable, and listable by their owner, to avoid cases where
a directory prevents extraction of child entries by virtue of its
mode.

Most extraction errors will cause a `warn` event to be emitted. If
the `cwd` is missing, or not a directory, then the extraction will
fail completely.

The following options are supported:

* `cwd` Extract files relative to the specified directory. Defaults
  to `process.cwd()`. If provided, this must exist and must be a
  directory. [Alias: `C`]
* `file` The archive file to extract. If not specified, then a
  Writable stream is returned where the archive data should be
  written. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Create files and directories synchronously.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being unpacked. Return `true` to unpack the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `newer` Set to true to keep the existing file on disk if it's newer
  than the file in the archive. [Alias: `keep-newer`,
  `keep-newer-files`]
* `keep` Do not overwrite existing files. In particular, if a file
  appears more than once in an archive, later copies will not
  overwrite earlier copies. [Alias: `k`, `keep-existing`]
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths, paths containing `..`, and
  extracting through symbolic links. By default, `/` is stripped from
  absolute paths, `..` paths are not extracted, and any file whose
  location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.
  [Alias: `P`]
* `unlink` Unlink files before creating them. Without this option,
  tar overwrites existing files, which preserves existing hardlinks.
  With this option, existing hardlinks will be broken, as will any
  symlink that would affect the location of an extracted file. [Alias:
  `U`]
* `strip` Remove the specified number of leading path elements.
  Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped. Note that
  the pathname is edited after applying the filter, but before
  security checks. [Alias: `strip-components`, `stripComponents`]
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `preserveOwner` If true, tar will set the `uid` and `gid` of
  extracted entries to the `uid` and `gid` fields in the archive.
  This defaults to true when run as root, and false otherwise. If
  false, then files and directories will be set with the owner and
  group of the user running the process. This is similar to `-p` in
  `tar(1)`, but ACLs and other system-specific data is never unpacked
  in this implementation, and modes are set by default already.
  [Alias: `p`]
* `uid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified user id, regardless of the `uid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `gid` option.
* `gid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified group id, regardless of the `gid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `uid` option.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` value for extracted
  entries. [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `transform` Provide a function that takes an `entry` object, and
  returns a stream, or any falsey value. If a stream is provided,
  then that stream's data will be written instead of the contents of
  the archive entry. If a falsey value is provided, then the entry is
  written to disk as normal. (To exclude items from extraction, use
  the `filter` option described above.)
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `chmod` Set to true to call `fs.chmod()` to ensure that the
  extracted file matches the entry mode. This may necessitate a
  call to the deprecated and thread-unsafe `process.umask()`
  method to determine the default umask value, unless a
  `processUmask` options is also provided. Otherwise tar will
  extract with whatever mode is provided, and let the process
  `umask` apply normally.
* `processUmask` Set to an explicit numeric value to avoid
  calling `process.umask()` when `chmod: true` is set.
* `maxDepth` The maximum depth of subfolders to extract into. This
  defaults to 1024. Anything deeper than the limit will raise a
  warning and skip the entry. Set to `Infinity` to remove the
  limitation.

The following options are mostly internal, but can be modified in some
advanced use cases, such as re-using caches between runs.

* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `umask` Filter the modes of entries like `process.umask()`.
* `dmode` Default mode for directories
* `fmode` Default mode for files
* `dirCache` A Map object of which directories exist.
* `maxMetaEntrySize` The maximum size of meta entries that is
  supported. Defaults to 1 MB.

Note that using an asynchronous stream type with the `transform`
option will cause undefined behavior in sync extractions.
[MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)-based streams are designed for this
use case.

### tar.t(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.list]

List the contents of a tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to list from the tarball. If
no paths are provided, then all the entries are listed.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

If the `file` option is *not* provided, then returns an event emitter that
emits `entry` events with `tar.ReadEntry` objects. However, they don't
emit `'data'` or `'end'` events. (If you want to get actual readable
entries, use the `tar.Parse` class instead.)

If a `file` option *is* provided, then the return value will be a promise
that resolves when the file has been fully traversed in async mode, or
`undefined` if `sync: true` is set. Thus, you *must* specify an `onReadEntry`
method in order to do anything useful with the data it parses.

The following options are supported:

* `file` The archive file to list. If not specified, then a
  Writable stream is returned where the archive data should be
  written. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Read the specified file synchronously. (This has no effect
  when a file option isn't specified, because entries are emitted as
  fast as they are parsed from the stream anyway.)
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being listed. Return `true` to emit the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter. This is important for when `file` is set,
  because there is no other way to do anything useful with this method.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `noResume` By default, `entry` streams are resumed immediately after
  the call to `onReadEntry`. Set `noResume: true` to suppress this
  behavior. Note that by opting into this, the stream will never
  complete until the entry data is consumed.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")

### tar.u(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.update]

Add files to an archive if they are newer than the entry already in
the tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a
directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in `fileList` that starts with an `@` symbol is a tar archive
whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with `@`,
prepend it with `./`.

The following options are supported:

* `file` Required. Write the tarball archive to the specified
  filename. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file
  will be fully written after the call to `tar.c`.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `cwd` The current working directory for adding entries to the
  archive. Defaults to `process.cwd()`. [Alias: `C`]
* `prefix` A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
* `gzip` Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an
  object with settings for `zlib.Gzip()` [Alias: `z`]
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, stat)` for each
  entry being added. Return `true` to add the entry to the archive,
  or `false` to omit it.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths. [Alias: `P`]
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `noDirRecurse` Do not recursively archive the contents of
  directories. [Alias: `n`]
* `follow` Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without
  this option, symbolic links are archived as such. [Alias: `L`, `h`]
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
  [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `mtime` Set to a `Date` object to force a specific `mtime` for
  everything added to the archive. Overridden by `noMtime`.
* `onWriteEntry` Called with each `WriteEntry` or
  `WriteEntrySync` that is created in the course of writing the
  archive.

### tar.r(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.replace]

Add files to an existing archive. Because later entries override
earlier entries, this effectively replaces any existing entries.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a
directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in `fileList` that starts with an `@` symbol is a tar archive
whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with `@`,
prepend it with `./`.

The following options are supported:

* `file` Required. Write the tarball archive to the specified
  filename. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file
  will be fully written after the call to `tar.c`.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `cwd` The current working directory for adding entries to the
  archive. Defaults to `process.cwd()`. [Alias: `C`]
* `prefix` A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
* `gzip` Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an
  object with settings for `zlib.Gzip()` [Alias: `z`]
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, stat)` for each
  entry being added. Return `true` to add the entry to the archive,
  or `false` to omit it.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths. [Alias: `P`]
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `noDirRecurse` Do not recursively archive the contents of
  directories. [Alias: `n`]
* `follow` Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without
  this option, symbolic links are archived as such. [Alias: `L`, `h`]
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
  [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `mtime` Set to a `Date` object to force a specific `mtime` for
  everything added to the archive. Overridden by `noMtime`.
* `onWriteEntry` Called with each `WriteEntry` or
  `WriteEntrySync` that is created in the course of writing the
  archive.

## Low-Level API

### class Pack

A readable tar stream.

Has all the standard readable stream interface stuff. `'data'` and
`'end'` events, `read()` method, `pause()` and `resume()`, etc.

#### constructor(options)

The following options are supported:

* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `cwd` The current working directory for creating the archive.
  Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
* `prefix` A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
* `gzip` Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an

* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths.
* `linkCache` A Map object containing the device and inode value for
  any file whose nlink is > 1, to identify hard links.
* `statCache` A Map object that caches calls `lstat`.

  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `noDirRecurse` Do not recursively archive the contents of
  directories.
* `follow` Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without
  this option, symbolic links are archived as such.
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
* `mtime` Set to a `Date` object to force a specific `mtime` for
  everything added to the archive. Overridden by `noMtime`.
* `onWriteEntry` Called with each `WriteEntry` or
  `WriteEntrySync` that is created in the course of writing the
  archive.

#### add(path)

Adds an entry to the archive. Returns the Pack stream.

#### write(path)

Adds an entry to the archive. Returns true if flushed.

#### end()

Finishes the archive.

### class PackSync

Synchronous version of `Pack`.

### class Unpack

A writable stream that unpacks a tar archive onto the file system.

All the normal writable stream stuff is supported. `write()` and
`end()` methods, `'drain'` events, etc.

Note that all directories that are created will be forced to be
writable, readable, and listable by their owner, to avoid cases where
a directory prevents extraction of child entries by virtue of its
mode.

`'close'` is emitted when it's done writing stuff to the file system.

Most unpack errors will cause a `warn` event to be emitted. If the
`cwd` is missing, or not a directory, then an error will be emitted.

#### constructor(options)

* `cwd` Extract files relative to the specified directory. Defaults
  to `process.cwd()`. If provided, this must exist and must be a
  directory.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being unpacked. Return `true` to unpack the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `newer` Set to true to keep the existing file on disk if it's newer
  than the file in the archive.
* `keep` Do not overwrite existing files. In particular, if a file
  appears more than once in an archive, later copies will not
  overwrite earlier copies.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths, paths containing `..`, and
  extracting through symbolic links. By default, `/` is stripped from
  absolute paths, `..` paths are not extracted, and any file whose
  location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.
* `unlink` Unlink files before creating them. Without this option,
  tar overwrites existing files, which preserves existing hardlinks.
  With this option, existing hardlinks will be broken, as will any
  symlink that would affect the location of an extracted file.
* `strip` Remove the specified number of leading path elements.
  Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped. Note that
  the pathname is edited after applying the filter, but before
  security checks.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `umask` Filter the modes of entries like `process.umask()`.
* `dmode` Default mode for directories
* `fmode` Default mode for files
* `dirCache` A Map object of which directories exist.
* `maxMetaEntrySize` The maximum size of meta entries that is
  supported. Defaults to 1 MB.
* `preserveOwner` If true, tar will set the `uid` and `gid` of
  extracted entries to the `uid` and `gid` fields in the archive.
  This defaults to true when run as root, and false otherwise. If
  false, then files and directories will be set with the owner and
  group of the user running the process. This is similar to `-p` in
  `tar(1)`, but ACLs and other system-specific data is never unpacked
  in this implementation, and modes are set by default already.
* `win32` True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where
  filenames containing `<|>?` chars are converted to
  windows-compatible values while being unpacked.
* `uid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified user id, regardless of the `uid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `gid` option.
* `gid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified group id, regardless of the `gid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `uid` option.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` value for extracted
  entries.
* `transform` Provide a function that takes an `entry` object, and
  returns a stream, or any falsey value. If a stream is provided,
  then that stream's data will be written instead of the contents of
  the archive entry. If a falsey value is provided, then the entry is
  written to disk as normal. (To exclude items from extraction, use
  the `filter` option described above.)
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `chmod` Set to true to call `fs.chmod()` to ensure that the
  extracted file matches the entry mode. This may necessitate a
  call to the deprecated and thread-unsafe `process.umask()`
  method to determine the default umask value, unless a
  `processUmask` options is also provided. Otherwise tar will
  extract with whatever mode is provided, and let the process
  `umask` apply normally.
* `processUmask` Set to an explicit numeric value to avoid
  calling `process.umask()` when `chmod: true` is set.
* `maxDepth` The maximum depth of subfolders to extract into. This
  defaults to 1024. Anything deeper than the limit will raise a
  warning and skip the entry. Set to `Infinity` to remove the
  limitation.

### class UnpackSync

Synchronous version of `Unpack`.

Note that using an asynchronous stream type with the `transform`
option will cause undefined behavior in sync unpack streams.
[MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)-based streams are designed for this
use case.

### class tar.Parse

A writable stream that parses a tar archive stream. All the standard
writable stream stuff is supported.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

Emits `'entry'` events with `tar.ReadEntry` objects, which are
themselves readable streams that you can pipe wherever.

Each `entry` will not emit until the one before it is flushed through,
so make sure to either consume the data (with `on('data', ...)` or
`.pipe(...)`) or throw it away with `.resume()` to keep the stream
flowing.

#### constructor(options)

Returns an event emitter that emits `entry` events with
`tar.ReadEntry` objects.

The following options are supported:

* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being listed. Return `true` to emit the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")

#### abort(error)

Stop all parsing activities. This is called when there are zlib
errors. It also emits an unrecoverable warning with the error provided.

### class tar.ReadEntry extends [MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)

A representation of an entry that is being read out of a tar archive.

It has the following fields:

* `extended` The extended metadata object provided to the constructor.
* `globalExtended` The global extended metadata object provided to the
  constructor.
* `remain` The number of bytes remaining to be written into the
  stream.
* `blockRemain` The number of 512-byte blocks remaining to be written
  into the stream.
* `ignore` Whether this entry should be ignored.
* `meta` True if this represents metadata about the next entry, false
  if it represents a filesystem object.
* All the fields from the header, extended header, and global extended
  header are added to the ReadEntry object. So it has `path`, `type`,
  `size`, `mode`, and so on.

#### constructor(header, extended, globalExtended)

Create a new ReadEntry object with the specified header, extended
header, and global extended header values.

### class tar.WriteEntry extends [MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)

A representation of an entry that is being written from the file
system into a tar archive.

Emits data for the Header, and for the Pax Extended Header if one is
required, as well as any body data.

Creating a WriteEntry for a directory does not also create
WriteEntry objects for all of the directory contents.

It has the following fields:

* `path` The path field that will be written to the archive. By
  default, this is also the path from the cwd to the file system
  object.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `myuid` If supported, the uid of the user running the current
  process.
* `myuser` The `env.USER` string if set, or `''`. Set as the entry
  `uname` field if the file's `uid` matches `this.myuid`.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 1 MB.
* `linkCache` A Map object containing the device and inode value for
  any file whose nlink is > 1, to identify hard links.
* `statCache` A Map object that caches calls `lstat`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths.
* `cwd` The current working directory for creating the archive.
  Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
* `absolute` The absolute path to the entry on the filesystem. By
  default, this is `path.resolve(this.cwd, this.path)`, but it can be
  overridden explicitly.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `win32` True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where paths
  replace `\` with `/` and filenames containing the windows-compatible
  forms of `<|>?:` characters are converted to actual `<|>?:` characters
  in the archive.
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.

#### constructor(path, options)

`path` is the path of the entry as it is written in the archive.

The following options are supported:

* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 1 MB.
* `linkCache` A Map object containing the device and inode value for
  any file whose nlink is > 1, to identify hard links.
* `statCache` A Map object that caches calls `lstat`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths.
* `cwd` The current working directory for creating the archive.
  Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
* `absolute` The absolute path to the entry on the filesystem. By
  default, this is `path.resolve(this.cwd, this.path)`, but it can be
  overridden explicitly.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `win32` True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where paths
  replace `\` with `/`.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
* `umask` Set to restrict the modes on the entries in the archive,
  somewhat like how umask works on file creation. Defaults to
  `process.umask()` on unix systems, or `0o22` on Windows.

#### warn(message, data)

If strict, emit an error with the provided message.

Othewise, emit a `'warn'` event with the provided message and data.

### class tar.WriteEntry.Sync

Synchronous version of tar.WriteEntry

### class tar.WriteEntry.Tar

A version of tar.WriteEntry that gets its data from a tar.ReadEntry
instead of from the filesystem.

#### constructor(readEntry, options)

`readEntry` is the entry being read out of another archive.

The following options are supported:

* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.

### class tar.Header

A class for reading and writing header blocks.

It has the following fields:

* `nullBlock` True if decoding a block which is entirely composed of
  `0x00` null bytes. (Useful because tar files are terminated by
  at least 2 null blocks.)
* `cksumValid` True if the checksum in the header is valid, false
  otherwise.
* `needPax` True if the values, as encoded, will require a Pax
  extended header.
* `path` The path of the entry.
* `mode` The 4 lowest-order octal digits of the file mode. That is,
  read/write/execute permissions for world, group, and owner, and the
  setuid, setgid, and sticky bits.
* `uid` Numeric user id of the file owner
* `gid` Numeric group id of the file owner
* `size` Size of the file in bytes
* `mtime` Modified time of the file
* `cksum` The checksum of the header. This is generated by adding all
  the bytes of the header block, treating the checksum field itself as
  all ascii space characters (that is, `0x20`).
* `type` The human-readable name of the type of entry this represents,
  or the alphanumeric key if unknown.
* `typeKey` The alphanumeric key for the type of entry this header
  represents.
* `linkpath` The target of Link and SymbolicLink entries.
* `uname` Human-readable user name of the file owner
* `gname` Human-readable group name of the file owner
* `devmaj` The major portion of the device number. Always `0` for
  files, directories, and links.
* `devmin` The minor portion of the device number. Always `0` for
  files, directories, and links.
* `atime` File access time.
* `ctime` File change time.

#### constructor(data, [offset=0])

`data` is optional. It is either a Buffer that should be interpreted
as a tar Header starting at the specified offset and continuing for
512 bytes, or a data object of keys and values to set on the header
object, and eventually encode as a tar Header.

#### decode(block, offset)

Decode the provided buffer starting at the specified offset.

Buffer length must be greater than 512 bytes.

#### set(data)

Set the fields in the data object.

#### encode(buffer, offset)

Encode the header fields into the buffer at the specified offset.

Returns `this.needPax` to indicate whether a Pax Extended Header is
required to properly encode the specified data.

### class tar.Pax

An object representing a set of key-value pairs in an Pax extended
header entry.

It has the following fields. Where the same name is used, they have
the same semantics as the tar.Header field of the same name.

* `global` True if this represents a global extended header, or false
  if it is for a single entry.
* `atime`
* `charset`
* `comment`
* `ctime`
* `gid`
* `gname`
* `linkpath`
* `mtime`
* `path`
* `size`
* `uid`
* `uname`
* `dev`
* `ino`
* `nlink`

#### constructor(object, global)

Set the fields set in the object. `global` is a boolean that defaults
to false.

#### encode()

Return a Buffer containing the header and body for the Pax extended
header entry, or `null` if there is nothing to encode.

#### encodeBody()

Return a string representing the body of the pax extended header
entry.

#### encodeField(fieldName)

Return a string representing the key/value encoding for the specified
fieldName, or `''` if the field is unset.

### tar.Pax.parse(string, extended, global)

Return a new Pax object created by parsing the contents of the string
provided.

If the `extended` object is set, then also add the fields from that
object. (This is necessary because multiple metadata entries can
occur in sequence.)

### tar.types

A translation table for the `type` field in tar headers.

#### tar.types.name.get(code)

Get the human-readable name for a given alphanumeric code.

#### tar.types.code.get(name)

Get the alphanumeric code for a given human-readable name.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - October 2021

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 419 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [October 2021 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2809080.1).

### Affected Products and Patch Information

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security fixes and detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle E-Business Suite Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 18 new security patches for Oracle E-Business Suite.  4 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuoct2021verbose.html#EBS)

Oracle E-Business Suite products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle E-Business Suite products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle E-Business Suite risk matrix.

# node-tar

Fast and full-featured Tar for Node.js

The API is designed to mimic the behavior of `tar(1)` on unix systems.
If you are familiar with how tar works, most of this will hopefully be
straightforward for you. If not, then hopefully this module can teach
you useful unix skills that may come in handy someday :)

## Background

A "tar file" or "tarball" is an archive of file system entries
(directories, files, links, etc.) The name comes from "tape archive".
If you run `man tar` on almost any Unix command line, you'll learn
quite a bit about what it can do, and its history.

Tar has 5 main top-level commands:

* `c` Create an archive
* `r` Replace entries within an archive
* `u` Update entries within an archive (ie, replace if they're newer)
* `t` List out the contents of an archive
* `x` Extract an archive to disk

The other flags and options modify how this top level function works.

## High-Level API

These 5 functions are the high-level API. All of them have a
single-character name (for unix nerds familiar with `tar(1)`) as well
as a long name (for everyone else).

All the high-level functions take the following arguments, all three
of which are optional and may be omitted.

1. `options` - An optional object specifying various options
2. `paths` - An array of paths to add or extract
3. `callback` - Called when the command is completed, if async. (If
   sync or no file specified, providing a callback throws a
   `TypeError`.)

If the command is sync (ie, if `options.sync=true`), then the
callback is not allowed, since the action will be completed immediately.

If a `file` argument is specified, and the command is async, then a
`Promise` is returned. In this case, if async, a callback may be
provided which is called when the command is completed.

If a `file` option is not specified, then a stream is returned. For
`create`, this is a readable stream of the generated archive. For
`list` and `extract` this is a writable stream that an archive should
be written into. If a file is not specified, then a callback is not
allowed, because you're already getting a stream to work with.

`replace` and `update` only work on existing archives, and so require
a `file` argument.

Sync commands without a file argument return a stream that acts on its
input immediately in the same tick. For readable streams, this means
that all of the data is immediately available by calling
`stream.read()`. For writable streams, it will be acted upon as soon
as it is provided, but this can be at any time.

### Warnings and Errors

Tar emits warnings and errors for recoverable and unrecoverable situations,
respectively. In many cases, a warning only affects a single entry in an
archive, or is simply informing you that it's modifying an entry to comply
with the settings provided.

Unrecoverable warnings will always raise an error (ie, emit `'error'` on
streaming actions, throw for non-streaming sync actions, reject the
returned Promise for non-streaming async operations, or call a provided
callback with an `Error` as the first argument). Recoverable errors will
raise an error only if `strict: true` is set in the options.

Respond to (recoverable) warnings by listening to the `warn` event.
Handlers receive 3 arguments:

* `code` String. One of the error codes below. This may not match
  `data.code`, which preserves the original error code from fs and zlib.
* `message` String. More details about the error.
* `data` Metadata about the error. An `Error` object for errors raised by
  fs and zlib. All fields are attached to errors raisd by tar. Typically
  contains the following fields, as relevant:
  + `tarCode` The tar error code.
  + `code` Either the tar error code, or the error code set by the
    underlying system.
  + `file` The archive file being read or written.
  + `cwd` Working directory for creation and extraction operations.
  + `entry` The entry object (if it could be created) for `TAR_ENTRY_INFO`,
    `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID`, and `TAR_ENTRY_ERROR` warnings.
  + `header` The header object (if it could be created, and the entry could
    not be created) for `TAR_ENTRY_INFO` and `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID` warnings.
  + `recoverable` Boolean. If `false`, then the warning will emit an
    `error`, even in non-strict mode.

#### Error Codes

* `TAR_ENTRY_INFO` An informative error indicating that an entry is being
  modified, but otherwise processed normally. For example, removing `/` or
  `C:\` from absolute paths if `preservePaths` is not set.
* `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID` An indication that a given entry is not a valid tar
  archive entry, and will be skipped. This occurs when:

  + a checksum fails,
  + a `linkpath` is missing for a link type, or
  + a `linkpath` is provided for a non-link type.

  If every entry in a parsed archive raises an `TAR_ENTRY_INVALID` error,
  then the archive is presumed to be unrecoverably broken, and
  `TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE` will be raised.
* `TAR_ENTRY_ERROR` The entry appears to be a valid tar archive entry, but
  encountered an error which prevented it from being unpacked. This occurs
  when:

  + an unrecoverable fs error happens during unpacking,
  + an entry is trying to extract into an excessively deep
    location (by default, limited to 1024 subfolders),
  + an entry has `..` in the path and `preservePaths` is not set, or
  + an entry is extracting through a symbolic link, when `preservePaths` is
    not set.
* `TAR_ENTRY_UNSUPPORTED` An indication that a given entry is
  a valid archive entry, but of a type that is unsupported, and so will be
  skipped in archive creation or extracting.
* `TAR_ABORT` When parsing gzipped-encoded archives, the parser will
  abort the parse process raise a warning for any zlib errors encountered.
  Aborts are considered unrecoverable for both parsing and unpacking.
* `TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE` The archive file is totally hosed. This can happen for
  a number of reasons, and always occurs at the end of a parse or extract:

  + An entry body was truncated before seeing the full number of bytes.
  + The archive contained only invalid entries, indicating that it is
    likely not an archive, or at least, not an archive this library can
    parse.

  `TAR_BAD_ARCHIVE` is considered informative for parse operations, but
  unrecoverable for extraction. Note that, if encountered at the end of an
  extraction, tar WILL still have extracted as much it could from the
  archive, so there may be some garbage files to clean up.

Errors that occur deeper in the system (ie, either the filesystem or zlib)
will have their error codes left intact, and a `tarCode` matching one of
the above will be added to the warning metadata or the raised error object.

Errors generated by tar will have one of the above codes set as the
`error.code` field as well, but since errors originating in zlib or fs will
have their original codes, it's better to read `error.tarCode` if you wish
to see how tar is handling the issue.

### Examples

The API mimics the `tar(1)` command line functionality, with aliases
for more human-readable option and function names. The goal is that
if you know how to use `tar(1)` in Unix, then you know how to use
`import('tar')` in JavaScript.

To replicate `tar czf my-tarball.tgz files and folders`, you'd do:

```
import { create } from 'tar'
create(
  {
    gzip: <true|gzip options>,
    file: 'my-tarball.tgz'
  },
  ['some', 'files', 'and', 'folders']
).then(_ => { .. tarball has been created .. })
```

To replicate `tar cz files and folders > my-tarball.tgz`, you'd do:

```
// if you're familiar with the tar(1) cli flags, this can be nice
import * as tar from 'tar'
tar.c(
  {
    // 'z' is alias for 'gzip' option
    z: <true|gzip options>
  },
  ['some', 'files', 'and', 'folders']
).pipe(fs.createWriteStream('my-tarball.tgz'))
```

To replicate `tar xf my-tarball.tgz` you'd do:

```
tar.x( // or `tar.extract`
  {
    // or `file:`
    f: 'my-tarball.tgz'
  }
).then(_=> { .. tarball has been dumped in cwd .. })
```

To replicate `cat my-tarball.tgz | tar x -C some-dir --strip=1`:

```
fs.createReadStream('my-tarball.tgz').pipe(
  tar.x({
    strip: 1,
    C: 'some-dir', // alias for cwd:'some-dir', also ok
  }),
)
```

To replicate `tar tf my-tarball.tgz`, do this:

```
tar.t({
  file: 'my-tarball.tgz',
  onReadEntry: entry => { .. do whatever with it .. }
})
```

For example, to just get the list of filenames from an archive:

```
const getEntryFilenames = async tarballFilename => {
  const filenames = []
  await tar.t({
    file: tarballFilename,
    onReadEntry: entry => filenames.push(entry.path),
  })
  return filenames
}
```

To replicate `cat my-tarball.tgz | tar t` do:

```
fs.createReadStream('my-tarball.tgz')
  .pipe(tar.t())
  .on('entry', entry => { .. do whatever with it .. })
```

To do anything synchronous, add `sync: true` to the options. Note
that sync functions don't take a callback and don't return a promise.
When the function returns, it's already done. Sync methods without a
file argument return a sync stream, which flushes immediately. But,
of course, it still won't be done until you `.end()` it.

```
const getEntryFilenamesSync = tarballFilename => {
  const filenames = []
  tar.t({
    file: tarballFilename,
    onReadEntry: entry => filenames.push(entry.path),
    sync: true,
  })
  return filenames
}
```

To filter entries, add `filter: <function>` to the options.
Tar-creating methods call the filter with `filter(path, stat)`.
Tar-reading methods (including extraction) call the filter with
`filter(path, entry)`. The filter is called in the `this`-context of
the `Pack` or `Unpack` stream object.

The arguments list to `tar t` and `tar x` specify a list of filenames
to extract or list, so they're equivalent to a filter that tests if
the file is in the list.

For those who *aren't* fans of tar's single-character command names:

```
tar.c === tar.create
tar.r === tar.replace (appends to archive, file is required)
tar.u === tar.update (appends if newer, file is required)
tar.x === tar.extract
tar.t === tar.list

```

Keep reading for all the command descriptions and options, as well as
the low-level API that they are built on.

### tar.c(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.create]

Create a tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a
directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in `fileList` that starts with an `@` symbol is a tar archive
whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with `@`,
prepend it with `./`.

The following options are supported:

* `file` Write the tarball archive to the specified filename. If this
  is specified, then the callback will be fired when the file has been
  written, and a promise will be returned that resolves when the file
  is written. If a filename is not specified, then a Readable Stream
  will be returned which will emit the file data. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file
  will be fully written after the call to `tar.c`. If this is set,
  and a file is not provided, then the resulting stream will already
  have the data ready to `read` or `emit('data')` as soon as you
  request it.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `cwd` The current working directory for creating the archive.
  Defaults to `process.cwd()`. [Alias: `C`]
* `prefix` A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
* `gzip` Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an
  object with settings for `zlib.Gzip()` [Alias: `z`]
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, stat)` for each
  entry being added. Return `true` to add the entry to the archive,
  or `false` to omit it.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths. [Alias: `P`]
* `mode` The mode to set on the created file archive
* `noDirRecurse` Do not recursively archive the contents of
  directories. [Alias: `n`]
* `follow` Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without
  this option, symbolic links are archived as such. [Alias: `L`, `h`]
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
  [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `mtime` Set to a `Date` object to force a specific `mtime` for
  everything added to the archive. Overridden by `noMtime`.
* `onWriteEntry` Called with each `WriteEntry` or
  `WriteEntrySync` that is created in the course of writing the
  archive.

The following options are mostly internal, but can be modified in some
advanced use cases, such as re-using caches between runs.

* `linkCache` A Map object containing the device and inode value for
  any file whose nlink is > 1, to identify hard links.
* `statCache` A Map object that caches calls `lstat`.
* `readdirCache` A Map object that caches calls to `readdir`.
* `jobs` A number specifying how many concurrent jobs to run.
  Defaults to 4.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.

### tar.x(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.extract]

Extract a tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to extract from the tarball. If
no paths are provided, then all the entries are extracted.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

Note that all directories that are created will be forced to be
writable, readable, and listable by their owner, to avoid cases where
a directory prevents extraction of child entries by virtue of its
mode.

Most extraction errors will cause a `warn` event to be emitted. If
the `cwd` is missing, or not a directory, then the extraction will
fail completely.

The following options are supported:

* `cwd` Extract files relative to the specified directory. Defaults
  to `process.cwd()`. If provided, this must exist and must be a
  directory. [Alias: `C`]
* `file` The archive file to extract. If not specified, then a
  Writable stream is returned where the archive data should be
  written. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Create files and directories synchronously.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being unpacked. Return `true` to unpack the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `newer` Set to true to keep the existing file on disk if it's newer
  than the file in the archive. [Alias: `keep-newer`,
  `keep-newer-files`]
* `keep` Do not overwrite existing files. In particular, if a file
  appears more than once in an archive, later copies will not
  overwrite earlier copies. [Alias: `k`, `keep-existing`]
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths, paths containing `..`, and
  extracting through symbolic links. By default, `/` is stripped from
  absolute paths, `..` paths are not extracted, and any file whose
  location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.
  [Alias: `P`]
* `unlink` Unlink files before creating them. Without this option,
  tar overwrites existing files, which preserves existing hardlinks.
  With this option, existing hardlinks will be broken, as will any
  symlink that would affect the location of an extracted file. [Alias:
  `U`]
* `strip` Remove the specified number of leading path elements.
  Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped. Note that
  the pathname is edited after applying the filter, but before
  security checks. [Alias: `strip-components`, `stripComponents`]
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `preserveOwner` If true, tar will set the `uid` and `gid` of
  extracted entries to the `uid` and `gid` fields in the archive.
  This defaults to true when run as root, and false otherwise. If
  false, then files and directories will be set with the owner and
  group of the user running the process. This is similar to `-p` in
  `tar(1)`, but ACLs and other system-specific data is never unpacked
  in this implementation, and modes are set by default already.
  [Alias: `p`]
* `uid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified user id, regardless of the `uid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `gid` option.
* `gid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified group id, regardless of the `gid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `uid` option.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` value for extracted
  entries. [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `transform` Provide a function that takes an `entry` object, and
  returns a stream, or any falsey value. If a stream is provided,
  then that stream's data will be written instead of the contents of
  the archive entry. If a falsey value is provided, then the entry is
  written to disk as normal. (To exclude items from extraction, use
  the `filter` option described above.)
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `chmod` Set to true to call `fs.chmod()` to ensure that the
  extracted file matches the entry mode. This may necessitate a
  call to the deprecated and thread-unsafe `process.umask()`
  method to determine the default umask value, unless a
  `processUmask` options is also provided. Otherwise tar will
  extract with whatever mode is provided, and let the process
  `umask` apply normally.
* `processUmask` Set to an explicit numeric value to avoid
  calling `process.umask()` when `chmod: true` is set.
* `maxDepth` The maximum depth of subfolders to extract into. This
  defaults to 1024. Anything deeper than the limit will raise a
  warning and skip the entry. Set to `Infinity` to remove the
  limitation.

The following options are mostly internal, but can be modified in some
advanced use cases, such as re-using caches between runs.

* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `umask` Filter the modes of entries like `process.umask()`.
* `dmode` Default mode for directories
* `fmode` Default mode for files
* `dirCache` A Map object of which directories exist.
* `maxMetaEntrySize` The maximum size of meta entries that is
  supported. Defaults to 1 MB.

Note that using an asynchronous stream type with the `transform`
option will cause undefined behavior in sync extractions.
[MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)-based streams are designed for this
use case.

### tar.t(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.list]

List the contents of a tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to list from the tarball. If
no paths are provided, then all the entries are listed.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

If the `file` option is *not* provided, then returns an event emitter that
emits `entry` events with `tar.ReadEntry` objects. However, they don't
emit `'data'` or `'end'` events. (If you want to get actual readable
entries, use the `tar.Parse` class instead.)

If a `file` option *is* provided, then the return value will be a promise
that resolves when the file has been fully traversed in async mode, or
`undefined` if `sync: true` is set. Thus, you *must* specify an `onReadEntry`
method in order to do anything useful with the data it parses.

The following options are supported:

* `file` The archive file to list. If not specified, then a
  Writable stream is returned where the archive data should be
  written. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Read the specified file synchronously. (This has no effect
  when a file option isn't specified, because entries are emitted as
  fast as they are parsed from the stream anyway.)
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being listed. Return `true` to emit the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter. This is important for when `file` is set,
  because there is no other way to do anything useful with this method.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `noResume` By default, `entry` streams are resumed immediately after
  the call to `onReadEntry`. Set `noResume: true` to suppress this
  behavior. Note that by opting into this, the stream will never
  complete until the entry data is consumed.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")

### tar.u(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.update]

Add files to an archive if they are newer than the entry already in
the tarball archive.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a
directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in `fileList` that starts with an `@` symbol is a tar archive
whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with `@`,
prepend it with `./`.

The following options are supported:

* `file` Required. Write the tarball archive to the specified
  filename. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file
  will be fully written after the call to `tar.c`.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `cwd` The current working directory for adding entries to the
  archive. Defaults to `process.cwd()`. [Alias: `C`]
* `prefix` A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
* `gzip` Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an
  object with settings for `zlib.Gzip()` [Alias: `z`]
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, stat)` for each
  entry being added. Return `true` to add the entry to the archive,
  or `false` to omit it.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths. [Alias: `P`]
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `noDirRecurse` Do not recursively archive the contents of
  directories. [Alias: `n`]
* `follow` Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without
  this option, symbolic links are archived as such. [Alias: `L`, `h`]
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
  [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `mtime` Set to a `Date` object to force a specific `mtime` for
  everything added to the archive. Overridden by `noMtime`.
* `onWriteEntry` Called with each `WriteEntry` or
  `WriteEntrySync` that is created in the course of writing the
  archive.

### tar.r(options, fileList, callback) [alias: tar.replace]

Add files to an existing archive. Because later entries override
earlier entries, this effectively replaces any existing entries.

The `fileList` is an array of paths to add to the tarball. Adding a
directory also adds its children recursively.

An entry in `fileList` that starts with an `@` symbol is a tar archive
whose entries will be added. To add a file that starts with `@`,
prepend it with `./`.

The following options are supported:

* `file` Required. Write the tarball archive to the specified
  filename. [Alias: `f`]
* `sync` Act synchronously. If this is set, then any provided file
  will be fully written after the call to `tar.c`.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `cwd` The current working directory for adding entries to the
  archive. Defaults to `process.cwd()`. [Alias: `C`]
* `prefix` A path portion to prefix onto the entries in the archive.
* `gzip` Set to any truthy value to create a gzipped archive, or an
  object with settings for `zlib.Gzip()` [Alias: `z`]
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, stat)` for each
  entry being added. Return `true` to add the entry to the archive,
  or `false` to omit it.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths. [Alias: `P`]
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 16 MB.
* `noDirRecurse` Do not recursively archive the contents of
  directories. [Alias: `n`]
* `follow` Set to true to pack the targets of symbolic links. Without
  this option, symbolic links are archived as such. [Alias: `L`, `h`]
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
  [Alias: `m`, `no-mtime`]
* `mtime` Set to a `Date` object to force a specific `mtime` for
  everything added to the archive. Overridden by `noMtime`.
* `onWriteEntry` Called with each `WriteEntry` or
  `WriteEntrySync` that is created in the course of writing the
  archive.

#### end()

Finishes the archive.

### class PackSync

Synchronous version of `Pack`.

### class Unpack

A writable stream that unpacks a tar archive onto the file system.

All the normal writable stream stuff is supported. `write()` and
`end()` methods, `'drain'` events, etc.

Note that all directories that are created will be forced to be
writable, readable, and listable by their owner, to avoid cases where
a directory prevents extraction of child entries by virtue of its
mode.

`'close'` is emitted when it's done writing stuff to the file system.

Most unpack errors will cause a `warn` event to be emitted. If the
`cwd` is missing, or not a directory, then an error will be emitted.

#### constructor(options)

* `cwd` Extract files relative to the specified directory. Defaults
  to `process.cwd()`. If provided, this must exist and must be a
  directory.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being unpacked. Return `true` to unpack the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `newer` Set to true to keep the existing file on disk if it's newer
  than the file in the archive.
* `keep` Do not overwrite existing files. In particular, if a file
  appears more than once in an archive, later copies will not
  overwrite earlier copies.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths, paths containing `..`, and
  extracting through symbolic links. By default, `/` is stripped from
  absolute paths, `..` paths are not extracted, and any file whose
  location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted.
* `unlink` Unlink files before creating them. Without this option,
  tar overwrites existing files, which preserves existing hardlinks.
  With this option, existing hardlinks will be broken, as will any
  symlink that would affect the location of an extracted file.
* `strip` Remove the specified number of leading path elements.
  Pathnames with fewer elements will be silently skipped. Note that
  the pathname is edited after applying the filter, but before
  security checks.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `umask` Filter the modes of entries like `process.umask()`.
* `dmode` Default mode for directories
* `fmode` Default mode for files
* `dirCache` A Map object of which directories exist.
* `maxMetaEntrySize` The maximum size of meta entries that is
  supported. Defaults to 1 MB.
* `preserveOwner` If true, tar will set the `uid` and `gid` of
  extracted entries to the `uid` and `gid` fields in the archive.
  This defaults to true when run as root, and false otherwise. If
  false, then files and directories will be set with the owner and
  group of the user running the process. This is similar to `-p` in
  `tar(1)`, but ACLs and other system-specific data is never unpacked
  in this implementation, and modes are set by default already.
* `win32` True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where
  filenames containing `<|>?` chars are converted to
  windows-compatible values while being unpacked.
* `uid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified user id, regardless of the `uid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `gid` option.
* `gid` Set to a number to force ownership of all extracted files and
  folders, and all implicitly created directories, to be owned by the
  specified group id, regardless of the `gid` field in the archive.
  Cannot be used along with `preserveOwner`. Requires also setting a
  `uid` option.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` value for extracted
  entries.
* `transform` Provide a function that takes an `entry` object, and
  returns a stream, or any falsey value. If a stream is provided,
  then that stream's data will be written instead of the contents of
  the archive entry. If a falsey value is provided, then the entry is
  written to disk as normal. (To exclude items from extraction, use
  the `filter` option described above.)
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `chmod` Set to true to call `fs.chmod()` to ensure that the
  extracted file matches the entry mode. This may necessitate a
  call to the deprecated and thread-unsafe `process.umask()`
  method to determine the default umask value, unless a
  `processUmask` options is also provided. Otherwise tar will
  extract with whatever mode is provided, and let the process
  `umask` apply normally.
* `processUmask` Set to an explicit numeric value to avoid
  calling `process.umask()` when `chmod: true` is set.
* `maxDepth` The maximum depth of subfolders to extract into. This
  defaults to 1024. Anything deeper than the limit will raise a
  warning and skip the entry. Set to `Infinity` to remove the
  limitation.

### class UnpackSync

Synchronous version of `Unpack`.

Note that using an asynchronous stream type with the `transform`
option will cause undefined behavior in sync unpack streams.
[MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)-based streams are designed for this
use case.

### class tar.Parse

A writable stream that parses a tar archive stream. All the standard
writable stream stuff is supported.

If the archive is gzipped, then tar will detect this and unzip it.

Emits `'entry'` events with `tar.ReadEntry` objects, which are
themselves readable streams that you can pipe wherever.

Each `entry` will not emit until the one before it is flushed through,
so make sure to either consume the data (with `on('data', ...)` or
`.pipe(...)`) or throw it away with `.resume()` to keep the stream
flowing.

#### constructor(options)

Returns an event emitter that emits `entry` events with
`tar.ReadEntry` objects.

The following options are supported:

* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `filter` A function that gets called with `(path, entry)` for each
  entry being listed. Return `true` to emit the entry from the
  archive, or `false` to skip it.
* `onReadEntry` A function that gets called with `(entry)` for each entry
  that passes the filter.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")

#### abort(error)

Stop all parsing activities. This is called when there are zlib
errors. It also emits an unrecoverable warning with the error provided.

### class tar.ReadEntry extends [MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)

A representation of an entry that is being read out of a tar archive.

It has the following fields:

* `extended` The extended metadata object provided to the constructor.
* `globalExtended` The global extended metadata object provided to the
  constructor.
* `remain` The number of bytes remaining to be written into the
  stream.
* `blockRemain` The number of 512-byte blocks remaining to be written
  into the stream.
* `ignore` Whether this entry should be ignored.
* `meta` True if this represents metadata about the next entry, false
  if it represents a filesystem object.
* All the fields from the header, extended header, and global extended
  header are added to the ReadEntry object. So it has `path`, `type`,
  `size`, `mode`, and so on.

#### constructor(header, extended, globalExtended)

Create a new ReadEntry object with the specified header, extended
header, and global extended header values.

### class tar.WriteEntry extends [MiniPass](http://npm.im/minipass)

A representation of an entry that is being written from the file
system into a tar archive.

Emits data for the Header, and for the Pax Extended Header if one is
required, as well as any body data.

Creating a WriteEntry for a directory does not also create
WriteEntry objects for all of the directory contents.

It has the following fields:

* `path` The path field that will be written to the archive. By
  default, this is also the path from the cwd to the file system
  object.
* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `myuid` If supported, the uid of the user running the current
  process.
* `myuser` The `env.USER` string if set, or `''`. Set as the entry
  `uname` field if the file's `uid` matches `this.myuid`.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 1 MB.
* `linkCache` A Map object containing the device and inode value for
  any file whose nlink is > 1, to identify hard links.
* `statCache` A Map object that caches calls `lstat`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths.
* `cwd` The current working directory for creating the archive.
  Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
* `absolute` The absolute path to the entry on the filesystem. By
  default, this is `path.resolve(this.cwd, this.path)`, but it can be
  overridden explicitly.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `win32` True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where paths
  replace `\` with `/` and filenames containing the windows-compatible
  forms of `<|>?:` characters are converted to actual `<|>?:` characters
  in the archive.
* `noPax` Suppress pax extended headers. Note that this means that
  long paths and linkpaths will be truncated, and large or negative
  numeric values may be interpreted incorrectly.
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.

#### constructor(path, options)

`path` is the path of the entry as it is written in the archive.

The following options are supported:

* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `maxReadSize` The maximum buffer size for `fs.read()` operations.
  Defaults to 1 MB.
* `linkCache` A Map object containing the device and inode value for
  any file whose nlink is > 1, to identify hard links.
* `statCache` A Map object that caches calls `lstat`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths.
* `cwd` The current working directory for creating the archive.
  Defaults to `process.cwd()`.
* `absolute` The absolute path to the entry on the filesystem. By
  default, this is `path.resolve(this.cwd, this.path)`, but it can be
  overridden explicitly.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `win32` True if on a windows platform. Causes behavior where paths
  replace `\` with `/`.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.
* `umask` Set to restrict the modes on the entries in the archive,
  somewhat like how umask works on file creation. Defaults to
  `process.umask()` on unix systems, or `0o22` on Windows.

#### warn(message, data)

If strict, emit an error with the provided message.

Othewise, emit a `'warn'` event with the provided message and data.

### class tar.WriteEntry.Sync

Synchronous version of tar.WriteEntry

### class tar.WriteEntry.Tar

A version of tar.WriteEntry that gets its data from a tar.ReadEntry
instead of from the filesystem.

#### constructor(readEntry, options)

`readEntry` is the entry being read out of another archive.

The following options are supported:

* `portable` Omit metadata that is system-specific: `ctime`, `atime`,
  `uid`, `gid`, `uname`, `gname`, `dev`, `ino`, and `nlink`. Note
  that `mtime` is still included, because this is necessary for other
  time-based operations. Additionally, `mode` is set to a "reasonable
  default" for most unix systems, based on a `umask` value of `0o22`.
* `preservePaths` Allow absolute paths. By default, `/` is stripped
  from absolute paths.
* `strict` Treat warnings as crash-worthy errors. Default false.
* `onwarn` A function that will get called with `(code, message, data)` for
  any warnings encountered. (See "Warnings and Errors")
* `noMtime` Set to true to omit writing `mtime` values for entries.
  Note that this prevents using other mtime-based features like
  `tar.update` or the `keepNewer` option with the resulting tar archive.

### class tar.Header

A class for reading and writing header blocks.

It has the following fields:

* `nullBlock` True if decoding a block which is entirely composed of
  `0x00` null bytes. (Useful because tar files are terminated by
  at least 2 null blocks.)
* `cksumValid` True if the checksum in the header is valid, false
  otherwise.
* `needPax` True if the values, as encoded, will require a Pax
  extended header.
* `path` The path of the entry.
* `mode` The 4 lowest-order octal digits of the file mode. That is,
  read/write/execute permissions for world, group, and owner, and the
  setuid, setgid, and sticky bits.
* `uid` Numeric user id of the file owner
* `gid` Numeric group id of the file owner
* `size` Size of the file in bytes
* `mtime` Modified time of the file
* `cksum` The checksum of the header. This is generated by adding all
  the bytes of the header block, treating the checksum field itself as
  all ascii space characters (that is, `0x20`).
* `type` The human-readable name of the type of entry this represents,
  or the alphanumeric key if unknown.
* `typeKey` The alphanumeric key for the type of entry this header
  represents.
* `linkpath` The target of Link and SymbolicLink entries.
* `uname` Human-readable user name of the file owner
* `gname` Human-readable group name of the file owner
* `devmaj` The major portion of the device number. Always `0` for
  files, directories, and links.
* `devmin` The minor portion of the device number. Always `0` for
  files, directories, and links.
* `atime` File access time.
* `ctime` File change time.

#### constructor(data, [offset=0])

`data` is optional. It is either a Buffer that should be interpreted
as a tar Header starting at the specified offset and continuing for
512 bytes, or a data object of keys and values to set on the header
object, and eventually encode as a tar Header.

#### decode(block, offset)

Decode the provided buffer starting at the specified offset.

Buffer length must be greater than 512 bytes.

#### set(data)

Set the fields in the data object.

#### encode(buffer, offset)

Encode the header fields into the buffer at the specified offset.

Returns `this.needPax` to indicate whether a Pax Extended Header is
required to properly encode the specified data.

### class tar.Pax

An object representing a set of key-value pairs in an Pax extended
header entry.

It has the following fields. Where the same name is used, they have
the same semantics as the tar.Header field of the same name.

* `global` True if this represents a global extended header, or false
  if it is for a single entry.
* `atime`
* `charset`
* `comment`
* `ctime`
* `gid`
* `gname`
* `linkpath`
* `mtime`
* `path`
* `size`
* `uid`
* `uname`
* `dev`
* `ino`
* `nlink`

#### constructor(object, global)

Set the fields set in the object. `global` is a boolean that defaults
to false.

#### encode()

Return a Buffer containing the header and body for the Pax extended
header entry, or `null` if there is nothing to encode.

#### encodeBody()

Return a string representing the body of the pax extended header
entry.

#### encodeField(fieldName)

Return a string representing the key/value encoding for the specified
fieldName, or `''` if the field is unset.

### tar.Pax.parse(string, extended, global)

Return a new Pax object created by parsing the contents of the string
provided.

If the `extended` object is set, then also add the fields from that
object. (This is necessary because multiple metadata entries can
occur in sequence.)

### tar.types

A translation table for the `type` field in tar headers.

#### tar.types.name.get(code)

Get the human-readable name for a given alphanumeric code.

#### tar.types.code.get(name)

Get the alphanumeric code for a given human-readable name.

# Arbitrary File Creation/Overwrite via insufficient symlink protection due to directory cache poisoning

High

[isaacs](/isaacs)
published
GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw
Aug 3, 2021

## Package

npm

tar
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<3.2.3 || 4.x <4.4.15 || 5.x <5.0.7 || 6.x <6.1.2

## Patched versions

3.2.3 || 4.4.15 || 5.0.7 || 6.1.2

## Description

### Impact

Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

`node-tar` aims to guarantee that any file whose location would be modified by a symbolic link is not extracted. This is, in part, achieved by ensuring that extracted directories are not symlinks. Additionally, in order to prevent unnecessary `stat` calls to determine whether a given path is a directory, paths are cached when directories are created.

This logic was insufficient when extracting tar files that contained both a directory and a symlink with the same name as the directory. This order of operations resulted in the directory being created and added to the `node-tar` directory cache. When a directory is present in the directory cache, subsequent calls to mkdir for that directory are skipped. However, this is also where `node-tar` checks for symlinks occur.

By first creating a directory, and then replacing that directory with a symlink, it was thus possible to bypass `node-tar` symlink checks on directories, essentially allowing an untrusted tar file to symlink into an arbitrary location and subsequently extracting arbitrary files into that location, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

This issue was addressed in releases 3.2.3, 4.4.15, 5.0.7 and 6.1.2.

### Patches

3.2.3 || 4.4.15 || 5.0.7 || 6.1.2

### Workarounds

Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `filter` method which prevents the extraction of symbolic links.

```
const tar = require('tar')

tar.x({
  file: 'archive.tgz',
  filter: (file, entry) => {
    if (entry.type === 'SymbolicLink') {
      return false
    } else {
      return true
    }
  }
})
```

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.

[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-3jfq-g458-7qm9/dependabot)

## Package

npm

tar
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

< 3.2.2
>= 4.0.0, < 4.4.14
>= 5.0.0, < 5.0.6
>= 6.0.0, < 6.1.1

## Patched versions

3.2.2
4.4.14
5.0.6
6.1.1

## Description

### Impact

Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Overwrite, Arbitrary Code Execution

`node-tar` aims to prevent extraction of absolute file paths by turning absolute paths into relative paths when the `preservePaths` flag is not set to `true`. This is achieved by stripping the absolute path root from any absolute file paths contained in a tar file. For example `/home/user/.bashrc` would turn into `home/user/.bashrc`.

This logic was insufficient when file paths contained repeated path roots such as `////home/user/.bashrc`. `node-tar` would only strip a single path root from such paths. When given an absolute file path with repeating path roots, the resulting path (e.g. `///home/user/.bashrc`) would still resolve to an absolute path, thus allowing arbitrary file creation and overwrite.

### Patches

3.2.2 || 4.4.14 || 5.0.6 || 6.1.1

NOTE: an adjacent issue [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/npm/node-tar/security/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw) affects this release level. Please ensure you update to the latest patch levels that address [CVE-2021-32803](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-r628-mhmh-qjhw "CVE-2021-32803") as well if this adjacent issue affects your `node-tar` use case.

### Workarounds

Users may work around this vulnerability without upgrading by creating a custom `onentry` method which sanitizes the `entry.path` or a `filter` method which removes entries with absolute paths.

```
const path = require('path')
const tar = require('tar')

tar.x({
  file: 'archive.tgz',
  // either add this function...
  onentry: (entry) => {
    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {
      entry.path = sanitizeAbsolutePathSomehow(entry.path)
      entry.absolute = path.resolve(entry.path)
    }
  },

  // or this one
  filter: (file, entry) => {
    if (path.isAbsolute(entry.path)) {
      return false
    } else {
      return true
    }
  }
})
```

Users are encouraged to upgrade to the latest patch versions, rather than attempt to sanitize tar input themselves.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
