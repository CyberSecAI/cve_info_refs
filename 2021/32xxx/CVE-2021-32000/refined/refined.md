Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32000:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `clone-master-clean-up.sh` script's use of `rm -rf` and other commands that could be exploited through symbolic links (symlinks). Specifically, the script attempts to remove files and directories under `/etc/ssh`, `/root/.ssh`, `/home`, `/var/spool/postfix`, and `/var/log`. If an unprivileged user creates a symlink in their home directory (e.g., `/home/evil/.ssh -> /`), the script could follow this symlink and delete arbitrary files or directories outside the intended target, leading to a system wipe. Similarly, other directories owned by non-privileged users, such as those in `/var/spool/postfix` could be exploited if compromised.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Symbolic Link Following:** The primary weakness is the script's use of `rm -rf` and other operations that are vulnerable to symlink attacks. By placing a symlink pointing to a sensitive location, an attacker can trick the script into deleting unintended files.
2.  **Insecure File Operations:** The script performs file and directory removal operations without properly verifying the target or sanitizing the paths, leaving it susceptible to symlink based attacks.
3.  **Lack of Privilege Separation:** The script attempts to truncate log files, but it lacks proper privilege separation to ensure that it is not exploited via file permissions of log files.
4.  **Insufficient Input Validation:** The script did not validate the content of the `/home` directory, which could lead to deleting data from populated home directories of users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

An attacker could potentially:

1.  **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Delete arbitrary files or directories on the system, leading to data loss or system instability.
2.  **System Wipe:** Cause a complete system wipe if symlinks point to critical parts of the file system, such as the root directory `/`.
3.  **Denial of Service:** Render the system unusable by deleting essential files or configuration data.
4.  **Data loss:** Deleting user data from /home

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Local Access:** A local user with the ability to create symbolic links in the /home directory can exploit this vulnerability.
2.  **Compromised Services:** A compromised service running with a non-privileged user account (e.g. postfix user) could create malicious symlinks in their spool directories, enabling an attacker to delete files.
3.  **Pre-existing Symlinks:** Malicious symlinks can be set up on the system before the `clone-master-clean-up.sh` script is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

1.  **Local User:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system with the ability to create symlinks.
2.  **Compromised Service:** The attacker may also gain access via a compromised service running with non-privileged user access.
3.  **System Access:** The attacker must have the ability to execute the `clone-master-clean-up.sh` script, or their actions must occur before this script runs.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects `clone-master-clean-up` script versions 1.6-4.6.1 and prior in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 12 SP3, versions 1.6-3.9.1 and prior in SUSE Linux Enterprise Server 15 SP1, and versions 1.6-1.4 and prior in openSUSE Factory.
*   The fix for this vulnerability involved adding a warning message if the home directory has data, preventing softlink attacks by using `setpriv` when deleting spool files, and using the `-P` option in the `cd` command to avoid following symlinks when cleaning up log files.
*   The newer versions of the `find` command are considered safe against 'symlink' attacks.
*   A separate bug ([https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1203651](https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1203651)) was created to address a btrfs snapshot issue found during testing of the fix for CVE-2021-32000.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS v3 base score of 7.1. The CVSS vector string is `CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H`, indicating that the attack vector is Local, the attack complexity is Low, low privileges are required, there is no user interaction needed, and the impact on integrity and availability is high.
*  CWE-59 and CWE-61 are associated with this vulnerability.
