Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32428:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `veysel-xan.com` explicitly states that the identified SQL injection vulnerability in the "viaviwebtech Android EBook App" is associated with CVE-2021-32428. The provided details align with a SQL injection vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the `api.php` file of the Android EBook App.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection, specifically through the `author_id` parameter in the `api.php` file.
   - The `veysel-xan.com` content indicates this is a blind SQL injection vulnerability. The OWASP article also explains that with a blind SQL injection the application does not display error messages from the database, but instead an attacker must infer the database's response by monitoring the application's behavior.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - An attacker can potentially gain unauthorized access to the application's database.
   - Data exfiltration: Once in the database the attacker can retrieve sensitive data, including user information, book details, and other stored data.
   - Data modification: The attacker could also modify or delete data.
   - Service disruption: Depending on the attacker's actions the application may become unusable.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - The attack vector is through HTTP requests to the `api.php` endpoint.
   - The specific attack is achieved by manipulating the `author_id` parameter.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application's backend (likely where `api.php` is located).
   - The attacker does not need to be authenticated initially to exploit this vulnerability (based on the description it's present in api.php which often serves as a public API).

**Additional Notes:**

- The content provides more detail than a typical CVE description, pinpointing the vulnerable file (`api.php`) and parameter (`author_id`).
- The OWASP content provides detailed information about blind SQL injection techniques which is consistent with the description from `veysel-xan.com`.
- The content from codecanyon.net is related to the application, however it doesn't directly describe any vulnerability. It provides a product description for the application that contains the vulnerability.
