  "response": {
    "related": true,
    "information": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises because the module does not properly sanitize URLs when the `OIDCPreservePost On` directive is used. Specifically, single quotes in URLs were not escaped, leading to an XSS vulnerability.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which can then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to stealing user credentials, session hijacking, or performing other malicious actions on behalf of the victim.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "The attacker needs to craft a URL containing a single quote and include this crafted URL in the redirect process when `OIDCPreservePost On` is set."
      ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to influence the redirect URL used by the application when `OIDCPreservePost On` is enabled.",
    "additional_details": "The fix includes a function `oidc_util_javascript_escape` that properly escapes single quotes, double quotes, backslashes, forward slashes, carriage returns, line feeds, '<', and '>' characters in URLs and is used when the `OIDCPreservePost On` directive is used."
