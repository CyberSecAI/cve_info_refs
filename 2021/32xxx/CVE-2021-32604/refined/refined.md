{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The 'Sender Email' input field in the 'Request Files' feature of SolarWinds Serv-U FTP Server does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied input when generating publicly accessible share URLs.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper input sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript into a publicly shareable URL. When a victim visits the URL, the XSS payload is executed in their browser. This can lead to session hijacking, defacement, or redirection to malicious sites. More specifically, in this case, it can lead to an attacker intercepting uploaded files and redirecting them to a third-party server without the user knowing.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By creating a 'Request Files' URL with a crafted malicious payload in the 'SenderEmail' field. This is then distributed via email or other forms of communication."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires a low privileged account within Serv-U FTP Server, but can then cause impact to non-authenticated users via the created share URL.",
    "additional_information": "The vulnerability was discovered in SolarWinds Serv-U FTP Server versions up to 15.2.2.573. The vendor has addressed this vulnerability in later releases, specifically Serv-U 15.2.3"
