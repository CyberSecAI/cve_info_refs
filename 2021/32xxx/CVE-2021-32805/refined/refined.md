Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of the `next` parameter within the OAuth authorization flow of Flask-AppBuilder. Specifically, the application was not properly verifying if the redirect URL was within the application's domain.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Open Redirect:** The application was vulnerable to an open redirect because it used the `next` parameter from the OAuth state to redirect users after successful authentication, without properly validating the target URL.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The application lacked sufficient input validation of the `next` parameter within the OAuth state. It did not check if the domain in the `next` URL matched the application's domain.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Redirection to Malicious Site:** An attacker could craft a malicious URL that, upon successful OAuth authentication, redirects the user to an attacker-controlled website.
- **Phishing Attacks:** The attacker could use the open redirect to set up phishing attacks, luring users to fake login pages or other malicious content.
- **Session Hijacking:** Depending on the context, the attacker might be able to leverage the open redirect as part of a more complex attack to steal session cookies or other sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Maliciously Crafted URL:** The attacker would craft a malicious URL containing a `next` parameter that points to an external, untrusted site. The crafted URL would be for the application using Flask-AppBuilder and its OAuth login.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker would then distribute this link to users, possibly through phishing emails or social media.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft URLs:** The attacker must be able to create URLs with the `next` parameter pointing to an external malicious site and encode the URL into a state variable, which is then used by the OAuth flow.
- **No Special Access:** No special access to the application or server is needed; the attacker can use a standard web browser to send the crafted URL.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must use social engineering techniques to trick users into clicking the malicious link.

**Additional Information from the provided content:**
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 3.3.2 of Flask-AppBuilder.
- The fix involved adding a check to ensure the `next` parameter's URL hostname matches the host of the application, preventing redirection to external domains.
- A workaround was provided to filter HTTP traffic with a `?next={next-site}` parameter where the `next-site` domain is not the application being protected.
- The provided commit includes changes to `flask_appbuilder/security/views.py` to validate the `next` URL and also adds new tests to `flask_appbuilder/tests/test_mvc_oauth.py` to verify the fix.
-  The `requirements-extra.txt` file was updated to include `Authlib==0.15.4` and `setup.py` was updated to add `Authlib>=0.14, <1.0.0` to the `oauth` extra dependencies, which is related to OAuth implementation in the project.

In summary, the provided content confirms that CVE-2021-32805 is an open redirect vulnerability in Flask-AppBuilder that could be exploited via a malicious `next` URL parameter.
