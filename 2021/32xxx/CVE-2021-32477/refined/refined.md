Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The last access time of the Moodle mobile app was displayed on a user's profile page to all users, instead of being restricted to users with the appropriate capability (site administrators by default).
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Information exposure. The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper access control for sensitive user information.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  The exposure of the last app access time to non-administrators could reveal potentially sensitive user activity patterns or habits. The severity is considered minor.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through the user profile page, which is accessible to other users depending on the site's configuration.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be a regular user (non-site administrator) on the Moodle platform to view another user's profile page and the last app access time.
