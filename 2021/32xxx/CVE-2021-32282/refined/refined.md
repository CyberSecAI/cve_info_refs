Based on the provided information, this content relates to **CVE-2021-32282**.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a segmentation fault occurring in the `ircode_add_check` function within `gravity_ircode.c` at line 428. This is triggered during the compilation process of the Gravity programming language.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary vulnerability is a segmentation fault, which indicates a memory access violation. Specifically, the AddressSanitizer output shows a READ memory access on address 0x000000000000, which is a null pointer dereference. The vulnerable code is located in `ircode_add_check` function, suggesting a problem in intermediate code generation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The exploitation of this vulnerability leads to a crash of the Gravity compiler. This can halt the compilation process, potentially disrupting development workflows.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through crafted Gravity source code that triggers the problematic code path within the compiler. The provided POC file "SEGV-ircode\_add\_check-gravity\_ircode-428.zip" demonstrates how to trigger this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide input to the Gravity compiler. This could be a developer or a user who can control the input source code.
