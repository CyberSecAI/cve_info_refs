Based on the provided documents, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-32985:

**Root Cause:** Origin Validation Error. The software does not properly verify that the source of data or communication is valid.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-346: Origin Validation Error:** The software fails to validate the source of data or communication, which could lead to the system accepting malicious input from an untrusted source.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** If chained with other vulnerabilities, this could allow a malicious actor to execute arbitrary code with system privileges.
*   **Denial of Service:**  A separate, related vulnerability (CVE-2021-33010) can lead to a denial-of-service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based attacks. The vulnerability is exploitable from an adjacent network and can be triggered with low complexity.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the affected system.
*   **Low Attack Complexity:** Exploitation is possible without requiring specific or uncommon conditions.
*   **High Privileges:** While the CVE itself doesn't specify the need for prior privileges, it is noted that the full exploitation chain requires higher privileges.
