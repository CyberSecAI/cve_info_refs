# GHSL-2021-076: Arbitrary command execution in Gerapy - CVE-2021-32849

[![Author avatar](https://avatars.githubusercontent.com/u/61799930)
GitHub Security Lab](https://github.com/ghsecuritylab)

## Coordinated Disclosure Timeline

* 2021-05-13: Report sent to maintainers
* 2021-05-14: Report bounced
* 2021-05-14: Created GitHub issue asking for maintainer’s contact information
* 2021-11-22: Created GitHub issue warning of the expiration of the disclosure deadline
* 2021-11-24: Disclosing as per our [disclosure policy](https://securitylab.github.com/advisories/#policy).

## Summary

An authenticated attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the system.

## Product

Gerapy

## Tested Version

0.9.6

## Details

### Issue 1: `project_clone`

The function `project_clone` is vulnerable to command injection while handling attacker controlled data. The `address` (1) variable is used in the creation of a `git clone` command (2) in an insecure way that allows an attacker to craft the url of a repository that contains shell commands (3).

*From [views.py](https://github.com/Gerapy/Gerapy/blob/af5657354aa040d5a6b52c91a837f5d63422d6d3/gerapy/server/core/views.py#L339)*:

```
@api_view(['POST'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def project_clone(request):
    """
    clone project from github
    :param request: request object
    :return: json
    """
    if request.method == 'POST':
        data = json.loads(request.body)

        # NOTE(1): Address comes from the post's body.
        address = data.get('address')
        if not address.startswith('http'):
            return JsonResponse({'status': False})
        address = address + '.git' if not address.endswith('.git') else address

        # NOTE(2): Address is used to build a command without sanitization.
        cmd = 'git clone {address} {target}'.format(address=address, target=join(PROJECTS_FOLDER, Path(address).stem))
        logger.debug('clone cmd %s', cmd)

        # NOTE(3): Command is executed.
        p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE)
        stdout, stderr = bytes2str(p.stdout.read()), bytes2str(p.stderr.read())
        logger.debug('clone run result %s', stdout)
        if stderr: logger.error(stderr)
        return JsonResponse({'status': True}) if not stderr else JsonResponse({'status': False})

```

*Example:*

By specifying `address` to be `/dev/null || malicious code #` the executed command will look like this:

```
git clone /dev/null || malicious code #.git <...>

```
### Issue 2: `project_parse`

The function `project_parse` is vulnerable to command injection while handling attacker controlled data. Attacker controlled data coming from the body of a `POST` request (1) is used in the creation of a shell command (2) in a way that allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the host (3).

*From [views.py](https://github.com/Gerapy/Gerapy/blob/af5657354aa040d5a6b52c91a837f5d63422d6d3/gerapy/server/core/views.py#L539)*:

```
@api_view(['POST'])
@permission_classes([IsAuthenticated])
def project_parse(request, project_name):
    """
    parse project
    :param request: request object
    :param project_name: project name
    :return: requests, items, response
    """
    if request.method == 'POST':
        project_path = join(PROJECTS_FOLDER, project_name)

        # NOTE(1)
        data = json.loads(request.body)
        logger.debug('post data %s', data)
        spider_name = data.get('spider')
        args = {
            'start': data.get('start', False),
            'method': data.get('method', 'GET'),
            'url': data.get('url'),
            'callback': data.get('callback'),
            'cookies': "'" + json.dumps(data.get('cookies', {}), ensure_ascii=False) + "'",
            'headers': "'" + json.dumps(data.get('headers', {}), ensure_ascii=False) + "'",
            'meta': "'" + json.dumps(data.get('meta', {}), ensure_ascii=False) + "'",
            'dont_filter': data.get('dont_filter', False),
            'priority': data.get('priority', 0),
        }
        # set request body
        body = data.get('body', '')
        if args.get('method').lower() != 'get':
            args['body'] = "'" + json.dumps(body, ensure_ascii=False) + "'"

        # NOTE(2)
        args_cmd = ' '.join(
            ['--{arg} {value}'.format(arg=arg, value=value) for arg, value in args.items()])
        logger.debug('args cmd %s', args_cmd)
        cmd = 'gerapy parse {args_cmd} {project_path} {spider_name}'.format(
            args_cmd=args_cmd,
            project_path=project_path,
            spider_name=spider_name
        )
        logger.debug('parse cmd %s', cmd)

        # NOTE(3)
        p = Popen(cmd, shell=True, stdin=PIPE, stdout=PIPE, stderr=PIPE, close_fds=True)
        stdout, stderr = bytes2str(p.stdout.read()), bytes2str(p.stderr.read())
        logger.debug('stdout %s, stderr %s', stdout, stderr)
        if not stderr:
            return JsonResponse({'status': True, 'result': json.loads(stdout)})
        else:
            return JsonResponse({'status': False, 'message': stderr})

```

# The next step for LGTM.com: GitHub code scanning!

Today, GitHub code scanning has all of LGTM.com’s key features—and more! The time has therefore come to announce the plan for the gradual deprecation of LGTM.com.

Three years ago, [the team that built LGTM.com joined GitHub](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-github-welcomes-semmle/). From that moment on, we have worked tirelessly to natively integrate its underlying CodeQL analysis technology into GitHub. In 2020, GitHub code scanning was [launched](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#security) in public beta, and later that year it became [generally available](https://github.blog/2020-09-30-code-scanning-is-now-available/) for everyone. GitHub code scanning is powered by the very same analysis engine: CodeQL.

We’ve since continued to invest in CodeQL and GitHub code scanning. Today, GitHub code scanning has all of LGTM.com’s key features—and [more](https://github.blog/changelog/label/code-scanning/)! The time has therefore come to announce the plan for the gradual deprecation of LGTM.com.

### End of August 2022: no more user sign-ups and new repositories

Starting at the end of August, LGTM.com will no longer accept new user sign-ups. It will also no longer be possible to add new repositories for analysis to LGTM.com. Existing users will continue to be able to log in and use LGTM.com, and the analysis of existing repositories will continue to work. However, [historical analysis](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/viewing-history-of-project) will no longer be performed–only new commits will be analyzed.

### October: help migrate repositories to GitHub code scanning

We will do our best to help migrate repositories that actively use LGTM.com to flag potential security issues in their pull requests. For those repositories, we will create pull requests that add a [GitHub Actions workflow that runs code scanning](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/setting-up-code-scanning-for-a-repository#setting-up-code-scanning-manually). Once that configuration file is merged, the repository’s source code (and future pull requests) will be scanned by GitHub code scanning. GitHub code scanning will flag any potential security issues [in pull requests](https://github.blog/changelog/2022-06-02-users-can-view-and-comment-on-code-scanning-alerts-on-the-conversation-tab-in-a-pull-request/) and on the repository’s [security tab](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/code-scanning/automatically-scanning-your-code-for-vulnerabilities-and-errors/managing-code-scanning-alerts-for-your-repository). Once that’s all working as it should, you can disable the LGTM.com integration.

Some repositories make use of advanced LGTM.com build and analysis configurations. In such cases, we might not be able to automatically propose a GitHub Actions workflow to set up code scanning. We will notify such repositories directly.

### End of November: new commits and pull requests are no longer analyzed

At the end of November, LGTM.com will stop fetching new commits for the repositories that it analyzes. It will also stop analyzing pull requests on GitHub.com. Repositories that still use LGTM.com’s pull request analysis in the week(s) leading up to this deprecation phase will be reminded through a message in the pull request comments that are posted by LGTM.com.

### 16th of December: LGTM.com will be shut down

From the 16th of December, LGTM.com will no longer be available. This includes but is not limited to:

* [LGTM.com code quality badges](https://lgtm.com/help/lgtm/adding-badges-to-project-readme-files)
* The LGTM query console (including historical results)
* The LGTM documentation
* All LGTM.com APIs

## So long and thanks for all the fish!

On behalf of the entire LGTM.com team, we’d like to thank you all for joining us on this wonderful journey. From launching LGTM.com back in 2017, all the way through [GitHub’s acquisition of Semmle in 2019](https://github.blog/2019-09-18-github-welcomes-semmle/), the subsequent [launch of GitHub code scanning](https://github.blog/2020-05-06-new-from-satellite-2020-github-codespaces-github-discussions-securing-code-in-private-repositories-and-more/#security), and all the [improvements we’ve since shipped](https://github.blog/changelog/label/code-scanning/): it’s been an absolutely amazing journey. Thank you!
