Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-32849:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from two functions within the Gerapy application, `project_clone` and `project_parse`, that are susceptible to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **`project_clone` Function:**
    *   The `address` variable, obtained from the POST request body, is used to construct a `git clone` command without proper sanitization.
    *   An attacker can inject shell commands within the `address` parameter, leading to arbitrary command execution.
2.  **`project_parse` Function:**
    *   Data from the POST request body is used to create a shell command without proper sanitization.
    *   An attacker can manipulate the request parameters to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the host system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an authenticated attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server hosting the Gerapy application. This can lead to:

*   Complete compromise of the server
*   Data breaches and exfiltration
*   Malware installation
*   Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`project_clone`:** An attacker sends a malicious POST request to the `/project_clone` endpoint with a crafted `address` parameter containing shell commands.
*   **`project_parse`:** An attacker sends a malicious POST request to the `/project_parse` endpoint with crafted parameters (e.g., `url`, `body`, `headers`, etc.) that inject shell commands into the constructed command.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user of the Gerapy application. This implies having valid login credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by the GitHub Security Lab.
*   The affected versions of Gerapy are below 0.9.9.
*   The vulnerability is fixed in version 0.9.9.
*   The initial report was made on 2021-05-13.
*   The vulnerability was publicly disclosed on 2021-11-24 after the maintainers did not respond to the reports.
* The vulnerability was assigned the identifier `GHSL-2021-076-gerapy` by the GitHub Security Lab.
* The vulnerability was mentioned in GitHub issues #197 and #217.
*   The vulnerability was given the identifier `GHSA-756h-r2c9-qp5j` on Github.
