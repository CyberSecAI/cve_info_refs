The provided content relates to CVE-2021-32135.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a null dereference in the `trak_box_size` function within the GPAC library. This occurs because the code attempts to access members of `ptr->moov->mov->movieFileMap` without ensuring that these pointers are valid, and they can be NULL under certain conditions. Specifically, it checks `!ptr->moov || !!ptr->moov->mov || !ptr->moov->mov->movieFileMap` and returns if it is true, however it does not return if any of these are NULL.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference: The code dereferences `ptr->moov->mov->movieFileMap` without proper null checks, leading to a crash if `ptr->moov`, `ptr->moov->mov` or `ptr->moov->mov->movieFileMap` is NULL.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service: Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a crash due to a null pointer dereference, which causes a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted MP4 files: The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted MP4 file to the GPAC library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a malicious input file that will trigger the vulnerable code path.
