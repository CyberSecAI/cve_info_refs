# XSS in Nextcloud Text application

Low

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-x4w3-jhcr-57pq
Jul 12, 2021

## Package

Nextcloud Server

## Affected versions

< 19.0.13, < 20.0.11, < 21.0.3

## Patched versions

19.0.13, 20.0.11, 21.0.3

## Description

### Impact

The Nextcloud Text application shipped with Nextcloud server did use a `text/html` Content-Type when serving files to users.

Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Server is upgraded to 19.0.13, 20.0.11 or 21.0.3

### Workarounds

Use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy. You can find a list of supported browsers on [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/contentsecuritypolicy). A notable exemption is Internet Explorer which does not support CSP properly.
