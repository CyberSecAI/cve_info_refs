| Hi,  While fuzzing Schism Tracker git nightly rev: [e665489](https://github.com/schismtracker/schismtracker/commit/e665489da0e3165e926e2b01691772279ddb2247) (and also latest release Schism Tracker 20200412 ) with Honggfuzz, I found a heap-based buffer overflow READ of size 8 in the fmt\_mtm\_load\_song() function, in mtm.c.
