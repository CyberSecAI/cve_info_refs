Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32763:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability stems from a regular expression (regex) used in the `quote` method of the `MessagesController` in OpenProject. This regex is used to strip `<pre>` tags from quoted forum messages.
- The problematic regex is ` %r{<pre>((.|\s)*?)</pre>}m`. The `(.|\s)` part allows the regex engine to match a space character in two ways, leading to excessive backtracking when processing an unterminated `<pre>` tag with many spaces.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS):** The vulnerable regex causes the regex engine to try numerous states (2n, where n is the number of spaces) when encountering an unterminated `<pre>` tag with many spaces. This results in a performance bottleneck and possible denial of service.
- **Inefficient Regex:** The use of `(.|\s)` is inefficient as it attempts to match any character including whitespace in two different ways, which makes the engine backtrack and causes high resource consumption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending a crafted message with an unterminated `<pre>` tag containing a large number of spaces, an attacker can trigger excessive backtracking in the regex engine, leading to high resource consumption (CPU, memory) on the server. This can make the OpenProject instance unresponsive or unavailable for legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack can be launched over the network by submitting a malicious message through the OpenProject's forum functionality.
- **Input Injection:** The attacker injects the malicious payload with the specially crafted `<pre>` tag in a forum message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Low Privileges Required:** A user with the ability to post forum messages can exploit the vulnerability.
- **No User Interaction Required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without the need for interaction from other users.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the OpenProject instance.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in OpenProject versions up to and including 11.3.2. It has been fixed in version 11.3.3 by changing the regex to ` %r{<pre>(.+?)</pre>}m`.
- The provided patch ( <https://github.com/opf/openproject/pull/9447.patch> ) also mitigates the vulnerability.
- The fix replaces `(.|\s)*?` with `.+?`, which matches any character (except newline) one or more times, preventing excessive backtracking.
- The vulnerability is related to Redmine and forked from Redmine.
- The provided CVSS score is 4.3 with the following vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L
