# Heap Use After Free in the deletestringbox() function (READ of size 8 )

Hi,

While fuzzing dpic [68ab9432](/aplevich/dpic/-/commit/68ab94321d9ea978b68906d16a315efab4758353 "Colored svg sprintf text and appended %") with [AFL++](https://aflplus.plus/), I found a heap use-after-free in the deletestringbox() function, in dpic.y.

```
DISTRIB_ID=Ubuntu
DISTRIB_RELEASE=20.04
DISTRIB_CODENAME=focal
DISTRIB_DESCRIPTION="Ubuntu 20.04.2 LTS"
```

Attaching a reproducer: [test03](/-/project/5973503/uploads/337e2adfa7eaf8e89c5d87047d265b5d/test03)

the issue can be reproduced by running:

`dpic test03`

With ASAN report

```
