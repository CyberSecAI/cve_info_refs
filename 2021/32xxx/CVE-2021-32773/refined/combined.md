# Confused deputy attack in sandbox module resolution

Moderate

[samth](/samth)
published
GHSA-cgrw-p7p7-937c
Jul 19, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 8.2

## Patched versions

8.2

## Description

### Impact

Code evaluated using the Racket sandbox could cause system modules to incorrectly use attacker-created modules instead of their intended dependencies. This could allow system functions to be controlled by the attacker, giving access to facilities intended to be restricted.

### Patches

This problem is fixed in Racket version 8.2, now widely available from <https://download.racket-lang.org>.

### Workarounds

For systems that provide arbitrary Racket evaluation, external sandboxing such as containers limit the impact of the problem. For multi-user evaluation systems, such as the `handin-server` system, it is not possible to work around this problem and upgrading is required.

For users of the Handin server, it now provides an API to restrict `require`s for uses of teaching languages. We strongly encourage using this API [1], which can prevent exploiting this bug as well as other problems that access to full Racket or other installed modules might expose.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in [the racket repository](https://github.com/racket/racket/issues)
* Email us at security@racket-lang.org

### Severity

Moderate

### CVE ID

CVE-2021-32773

### Weaknesses
