Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32816:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of inefficient regular expressions in ProtonMail's web client, specifically within the `attachedPublicKey.js` file, while parsing the Autocrypt header to extract public keys. These regexes are susceptible to Regular Expression Denial of Service (ReDoS) due to ambiguity and overlapping clauses.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ReDoS:** The core issue is the presence of regular expressions that can exhibit exponential backtracking, leading to a denial of service when provided with crafted input strings.
- **Inefficient Regex:** The regular expressions used for parsing the Autocrypt header are not optimized, causing the regex engine to try multiple overlapping matches for strings. This can lead to very long processing times.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can craft a malicious email with a specially crafted Autocrypt header. Processing this email would trigger the vulnerable regex, causing the server to become unresponsive due to excessive CPU usage. This leads to denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Email:** An attacker sends a specially crafted email to a ProtonMail user. The email contains a malformed or ambiguous Autocrypt header that triggers the ReDoS vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to send emails:** The attacker needs to be able to send emails to a ProtonMail user.
- **Knowledge of Autocrypt header:** The attacker needs to be aware of the format and structure of the Autocrypt header and the ReDoS vulnerability.

**Technical Details:**

The vulnerable regexes were found in the `attachedPublicKey.js` file when parsing the Autocrypt header, for example:

```javascript
/^(\s*(_[^;\s]*|addr|prefer-encrypt)\s*=\s*[^;\s]*\s*;)*\s*keydata\s*=([^;]*)$/
/^(\s*(_[^;\s]*|addr)\s*=\s*[^;\s]*\s*;)*\s*prefer-encrypt\s*=\s*mutual\s*;/
/^(?:\s*(?:[^;\s]*)\s*=\s*[^;\s]*\s*;)*\s*keydata\s*=([^;]*)$/
```

The provided PoC demonstrates how an attacker can construct a string that will cause these regexes to not terminate. The fix involved updating the regular expression to remove the ambiguity/overlap.
```javascript
  const result = getParsedAutocryptHeader(header, message.Sender.Address);
```
The commit `6687fbb867ef872c96cf4fde68cb6e9c58d3fddc` shows the changes made to address the issue, which includes changes in `attachedPublicKey.js` and also introduces a new file called `autocryptHelper.js` which is used for parsing Autocrypt headers.
