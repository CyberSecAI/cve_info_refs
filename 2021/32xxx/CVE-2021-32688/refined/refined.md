Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-32688:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing permission check in Nextcloud Server's handling of application-specific tokens.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Improper Permission Check:** Application-specific tokens, which are meant to have restricted permissions (e.g., no filesystem access), were able to modify their own permissions due to a lack of proper validation. This allowed tokens with limited privileges to grant themselves full access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker using an app token with restricted permissions could escalate those privileges to gain unrestricted access, including the ability to access the filesystem.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker would need to have a valid app token to exploit the vulnerability. They would then use this token to modify its own permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to possess a valid application-specific token for a Nextcloud instance. This token might have initially been created with limited permissions.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was addressed in Nextcloud Server versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3.
- The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.
- A patch was implemented in pull request #27000 on the Nextcloud server GitHub repository.
- The vulnerability is related to CWE-285 (Improper Authorization).
- The vulnerability was initially reported on HackerOne.
