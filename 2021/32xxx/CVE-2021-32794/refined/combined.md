# Accidental removal of IPCPassword (< 5.1.2.4)

Moderate

[JustArchi](/JustArchi)
published
GHSA-wxx4-66c2-vj2v
Jul 23, 2021

## Package

ArchiSteamFarm
(GitHub)

## Affected versions

< 5.1.2.4

## Patched versions

≥ 5.1.2.4

## Description

### Impact

*What kind of vulnerability is it? Who is impacted?*

Due to a bug in ASF code, resolved as part of [#2379](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/pull/2379), `POST /Api/ASF` ASF API endpoint responsible for updating global ASF config incorrectly removed `IPCPassword` from resulting (updated) config when the caller (e.g. ASF-ui) did not specify it explicitly. This is incorrect behaviour, as existing `IPCPassword` should be preserved in the config itself if the caller does not specify it explicitly. The same behaviour applies to other sensitive properties, e.g. `SteamLogin` or `SteamPassword`, however, the bug described in this security advisory applies only to `IPCPassword` as only that property behaved incorrectly.

Due to the above, it was possible for the user to accidentally remove `IPCPassword` security measure from his IPC interface when updating global ASF config, which exists e.g. as part of global config update functionality in ASF-ui. Removal of `IPCPassword` possesses a security risk, as unauthorized users may in result access the (now insecure) IPC interface after such modification.

It was not possible to remove `IPCPassword` remotely without prior authorization or in any other way access protected IPC interface. Since the authorized user had to run into the bug described here and therefore authorize himself firstly, this issue is not critical, but of significant severity (to be exact, a bug in the program that could lead to security issue rather than security issue itself).

### Patches

*Has the problem been patched? What versions should users upgrade to?*

The issue is patched in ASF V5.1.2.4 and future versions.

While the patch itself will not bring removed `IPCPassword` back, additional security measures implemented as part of ASF V5.1.2.1 and above limit the damage by refusing to handle remote requests without `IPCPassword` set.

We recommend to manually verify that `IPCPassword` is specified after update, and if not, set it accordingly.

### Workarounds

*Is there a way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading?*

In default settings, ASF is configured to allow IPC access from `localhost` **only**, therefore the bug itself has rather very limited scope and should not affect majority of users in any negative way. Of course, the issue doesn't apply whatsoever if somebody is not using `IPC` at all.

In any case, the workaround would be to refrain from using `POST /Api/ASF` (so not using ASF-ui global config update functionality), or manually setting `IPCPassword` again after its removal. Once again, there is no security breach that would allow attacker to execute this bug remotely, it requires properly authorized user modifying the global config first.

### References

*Are there any links users can visit to find out more?*

The issue was originally reported at <https://steamcommunity.com/groups/archiasf/discussions/6/3057365873428498659/>

The fix was applied as part of [#2379](https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/pull/2379)

We suspect that the issue described here could be the root cause of reported security incidents mentioned in the thread above, as well as other places such as <https://keylol.com/t733938-1-1>

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Currently updating `GlobalConfig` via the respective IPC endpoint resets `IPCPassword` to its default value. This merge request attempts to fix the issue.

Sorry, something went wrong.

Beware of unknown method which steal inventory through ASF IPC(on VPS)
So far two ppl on Chinese steam forum got stolen and left their inventory empty.
They both have these following features:
1. Put their ASF on VPS and IPC server on behind a reverse proxy with password.
2.There is no login record of Steam and VPS from unknown address/device.
3.ASF record shows "Global config file has been changed" then someone added them as steam friend, and they accepted automaticlly(by the "steamownerID" or "steamuserpermission" from ASF config I guess)
4.Accept all the offers from same user "The trade offer xxxxxxx is determined to be Accepted due to OtherSteamID64 76561198194377091: Master." and left inventory empty.

Is there any idea how the hacker finds their IP address/domain name of the server running ASF and password?

So the user simply changed ASF config through the API and executed loot command, nothing unexpected if he managed to access the API itself.

You say that the IPCPassword was set, this is good, but it depends what it was, because if somebody set password as "asf" or something similar then the hacker could've simply guessed it right.

I'll take a deeper look if I see any way to actually skip providing IPCPassword to authorize the requests, but I doubt that this is possible. Rather I suspect misconfiguration or user's neglect.

Also, [https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ArchiSteamFarm/wiki/IPC](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJustArchiNET%2FArchiSteamFarm%2Fwiki%2FIPC) directly states that:

> Be extremely careful when you use Host values that allow remote access. Doing so will enable access to ASF's IPC interface from other machines, which may pose a security risk. We strongly recommend to use IPCPassword (and preferably your own firewall too) **at a minimum** in this case.

For example, IPCPassword will protect nothing if somebody configured his reverse-proxy to supply it automatically. Or if somebody configured ASF to trust nginx in known networks and he didn't protect his nginx against anti-bruteforce then attacker could've brute-forced the password through IP spoofing. There are a lot of factors, from what I observed majority of people do not give a single crap about security of their public ASF instances, it's easier to blame some unknown "exploit" rather than its own misconfiguration, neglecting to read the wiki and doing things right.

Of course if somebody has any proof or hint for me that ASF has a security issue which allows an attacker to skip the need of providing IPC password to every /Api endpoint, then I'll be welcome to hear it (while doing my own investigation), but for now I doubt in such possibility.

The fact that people are running insecure IPC instances is very common, I found it myself in [https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ASF-ui/issues/1461](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJustArchiNET%2FASF-ui%2Fissues%2F1461) and as part of ASF V5.1.2.X I'm implementing additional measures to protect people from (their own) stupidity - but this isn't any security exploit in ASF, this is a particular misconfiguration that ASF will hopefully prevent automatically, and only a particular one too, not all possible.

It's very possible that people were not using IPCPassword at all, e.g. due to [https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ASF-ui/issues/1481](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJustArchiNET%2FASF-ui%2Fissues%2F1481) issue (which is not really ASF's problem). This is also why I said multiple times that IPCPassword is the bare minimum, people using reverse-proxies to access ASF should at least have their own basic auth on top of it, which they didn't have.

As of now, I suspect that people used ASF-ui to modify global ASF config and had their IPCPassword removed, as per ASF-ui issue #1481 linked above.

Hi,Archi thanks for your reply,I guess they've counter ["https://github.com/JustArchiNET/ASF-ui/issues/1481"](https://steamcommunity.com/linkfilter/?u=http%3A%2F%2F%26quot%3Bhttps%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2FJustArchiNET%2FASF-ui%2Fissues%2F1481%26quot%3B) this issue you metioned,but they both claimed that they were using password because ASF asked for it when they logined with new device ,and they haven't changed the setting for a long time so it's weird.When they found they got stolen,IPC password has gone.

They can claim anything they want to, I didn't find any way to skip a requirement of IPCPassword to access any ASF endpoint withot prior authentication, and I won't analyze specific setups to find what mistakes the user has made that lead to him getting hacked, that's what you pay security forensics for. There are a lot of possibilities what user could do wrong, some of them I listed in my post above. Until somebody presents me with a valid reproduction or proof that I'm wrong and it's possible to skip IPCPassword with proper configuration, I'll have to assume that it's user's neglect - especially considering we have linked issue that could be the root cause of that.

And this is on top of the fact that user didn't set up ANY additional security as ASF wiki strongly recommended when exposing IPC to the public. Even nginx basic auth would've stopped that.
