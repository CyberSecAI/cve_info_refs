- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Integer overflow when decoding chunk sizes in HTTP chunked transfer encoding. The hyper library only reads the rightmost 64-bit integer as the chunk size, potentially truncating larger values.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Integer overflow, data loss, HTTP request smuggling/desync attacks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Data loss occurs if chunk sizes are truncated, resulting in incomplete data being read. HTTP request smuggling or desync attacks become possible when used in conjunction with an upstream proxy that has a different interpretation or handling of chunk sizes, where the proxy understands larger chunk sizes than hyper does, resulting in an inconsistency in how the request is processed between the proxy and the server.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending specially crafted HTTP requests or responses with large chunk sizes in chunked transfer encoding.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server using hyper or to an upstream proxy that will forward these requests to a hyper server.
