```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application does not properly sanitize user-controlled input when creating context menu items. Specifically, the `name` field of a menu item is directly inserted into the `innerHTML` property of an HTML element without any encoding.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML or JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of a user's browser when the context menu is rendered, potentially leading to malicious actions such as session hijacking, information theft, or defacement.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker needs to be able to control the `name` field of a context menu item when creating a `MindElixir` instance.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs the ability to influence the configuration data passed to the `MindElixir` constructor, specifically the `contextMenuOption.extend` array."
