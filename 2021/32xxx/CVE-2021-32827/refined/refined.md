  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The MockServer application has a default CORS configuration that is too broad, allowing any site to send cross-site requests, and it allows for script injection using Javascript or Velocity templates. The Javascript templates are evaluated using an unsandboxed Nashorn engine, and Velocity uses a script engine configured with VelocityScriptEngineFactory, allowing an attacker to execute arbitrary code on behalf of MockServer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Insecure default CORS configuration",
      "Script injection via Javascript templates",
        "Script injection via Velocity templates",
       "Unsandboxed Nashorn engine"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution on the MockServer machine by tricking a user into visiting a malicious site while running MockServer locally.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Cross-site requests due to insecure CORS",
      "Script injection via Javascript templates through the REST API",
       "Script injection via Velocity templates through the REST API"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to trick a victim into visiting a malicious site while the victim is running MockServer locally. The attacker must also be able to craft malicious JavaScript or Velocity templates to inject through the REST API."
