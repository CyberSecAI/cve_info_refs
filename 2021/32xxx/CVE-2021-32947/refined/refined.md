Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it into a stack-based buffer during the parsing of FPJ files.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Crafted FPJ files: An attacker can craft a malicious project file.
-  User interaction is required, where a target must open a malicious file or visit a malicious page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver a malicious FPJ file to the victim.
- The victim must open the file using the vulnerable software (FvDesigner).
- The attack vector is considered local, and non-remote.
