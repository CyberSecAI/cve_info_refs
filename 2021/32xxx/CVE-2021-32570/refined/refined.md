Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described, focusing on CVE-2021-32570:

**CVE-2021-32570:**

*   **Status:** The provided document mentions CVE-2021-32570 as a related vulnerability to other Ericsson products.
*   **Root Cause:**  Exposure of Resource to Wrong Sphere
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** In ENM releases before 21.2 users belonging to the same AMOS authorization group can retrieve the data related to managed network from each other. All AMOS users are considered to be highly privileged users in ENM system and all users must be previously defined and authorized by the Security Administrator. Those users can access some log’s files, under a common path, and read information stored in the log’s files in order to conduct privilege escalation
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can gain access to sensitive data that should not be accessible to other users within the same authorization group, potentially leading to privilege escalation.
*  **Attack vectors:** A malicious user belonging to the same AMOS authorization group can retrieve the data from specific log files that are intended for administrators only.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be an authenticated user within the same AMOS authorization group.
