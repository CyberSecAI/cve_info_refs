Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32814

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of file paths provided by a remote client to the `MKSNAP` action within the Skytable database server. Specifically, the server does not validate the provided filename argument, allowing directory traversal sequences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The core weakness is the server's failure to restrict the file path to a designated directory, allowing the client to access and manipulate files outside the intended scope.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The `MKSNAP` action did not validate or sanitize the file path provided by the client, leading to this vulnerability.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** The server was directly using the unsanitized client provided path to create snapshots, which could lead to arbitrary file writes

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary File Overwrite/Deletion:** A malicious client can use directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to specify a path outside the database's working directory, resulting in the ability to overwrite or delete arbitrary files on the server's filesystem if the process has the appropriate permissions.
*   **Potential System Compromise:** By overwriting critical system files, an attacker could potentially compromise the entire system.
*   **Data Loss:** The attacker could overwrite or delete critical data on the server through arbitrary file manipulation.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote Network Access:** The attack is performed remotely via the network by connecting to the database server.
*   **MKSNAP Action:** The attack exploits a specific `MKSNAP` action, that is part of the server's functionality.
*   **Directory Traversal:** The attack leverages directory traversal sequences in the file path provided to the `MKSNAP` action.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the database server.
*   **Authenticated Client (Potentially):** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the database server by sending it commands, and there is no mention in the content if an authenticated user is required
*   **Knowledge of `MKSNAP`:** The attacker needs to know about the `MKSNAP` action within the server's API and how to call it.
*   **Understanding of Directory Traversal:** The attacker needs knowledge of directory traversal techniques.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability exists in Skytable version 0.5.0.
*   It was fixed in version 0.5.1 by implementing path sanitization
*   The vulnerability is identified as `VE/S/00001` on the Skytable Security Advisory page.
*   A workaround involved restricting the permissions of the `skyd` process to its working directory.
*   The fix commit is  `38b011273bb92b83c61053ae2fcd80aa9320315c`, which adds a check if the path includes parent or root directories
