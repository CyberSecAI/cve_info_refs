  ```
* Click ‚ÄúCopy as HTML‚Äù
* Open https://b3log.org/vditor/demo/option-mode.html
* Paste into the text editor.

Note: This issue was found using the following [CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql/) [query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-xss/)

#### Impact

This issue may lead to XSS with user interaction
