Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32855:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the vditor text editor handles HTML content during copy-paste operations. Specifically, it fails to properly sanitize HTML pasted into the editor, allowing malicious code to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is a copy-paste XSS. The editor does not adequately sanitize HTML content that is copied from an external source and then pasted into the editor.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The editor's sanitization process (using `Lute.Sanitize`) was not effective in removing or neutralizing malicious HTML elements.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which is then executed within the context of the user's browser when the user views or interacts with the content in the editor.
- **Session Hijacking:** By executing malicious JavaScript, an attacker could steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the user's account.
- **Data Theft:** The attacker could also use JavaScript to steal other sensitive information from the user's browser or system.
- **Defacement or Redirection:** The injected script can alter the appearance of the page, redirect users to malicious sites, or perform other unwanted actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Copy-Paste:** The attack requires a user to copy HTML from a malicious source, then paste it into the vulnerable vditor editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Malicious HTML Creation:** An attacker needs to create a malicious HTML payload containing the XSS.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick a user into copying the malicious HTML payload.

**Technical Details:**
- The proof-of-concept provided involves a user opening a page (cdn.sekurak.pl/copy-paste/playground.html), pasting malicious HTML (e.g., `<img src="foo" onload="alert(1)" onerror="alert(2)"/>`) into the "HTML Input" field, copying the output as HTML, and then pasting it into the vditor editor.
- The fix involves sanitizing the pasted HTML using Lute.Sanitize, as indicated in the provided diffs from the commit `1b2382d`.
- The vulnerability was discovered using a CodeQL query.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content indicates the issue was fixed in commit `1b2382d`.
- The vulnerability was found by GHSL team members Erik Kristensen and Daniel Santos.
- The issue was also reported by a separate researcher which lead to a collision.
- The vulnerability is also present in the related Protyle editor.
- The fix was backported to the Siyuan note application.
- The vulnerability was fixed in vditor version 3.8.7
