- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  When an authenticated password change request occurs, an attacker can intercept the message containing the legitimate, new password hash and replace it with an illegitimate one.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Channel Accessible by Non-Endpoint (CWE-300).  The vulnerability stems from the ability to intercept and modify the password hash during a password change request.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service condition, where the legitimate user can no longer authenticate to the controller.  Recovery requires a firmware flash, which will erase the user program and data.
- **Attack vectors:** Remote network access is required to intercept the password change message.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker must be on the same network as the controller, be able to intercept network traffic, and must have knowledge of the password change process to intercept and manipulate the password hash. The attacker needs to be able to access the network and intercept a password change request.
