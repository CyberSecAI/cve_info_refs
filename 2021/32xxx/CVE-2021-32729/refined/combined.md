#### Description

A script service method has been introduced in 11.6RC1 as part of [~~XWIKI-15488~~](https://jira.xwiki.org/browse/XWIKI-15488 "Limit number of login attempts until user is asked for a captcha") to reset the counter of authentication failures. The @Programming annotation has been used on it, thinking that it would be enough to protect it, for being used only by users with PR.

However it's not the case: the annotation is only indicative and is not used to perform any check. Which means that right now any user with script rights can use this method.

# A user without PR can reset user authentication failures information

Low

published
GHSA-m738-3rc4-5xv3
Jul 1, 2021

## Package

maven

org.xwiki.platform:xwiki-platform-security-authentication-script
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

> 11.6RC1

## Patched versions

12.10.4, 13.0, 12.6.8

## Description

### Impact

The script service method used to reset the authentication failures record can be executed by any user with Script rights and does not require Programming rights as it should have.

Note that being able to reset the authentication failure record mean that an attacker with script right might use it to try performing a bruteforce attack since she'd been able to virtually deactivate the mechanism introduced to mitigate those attacks.

### Patches

The problem has been patched in version 12.6.8, 12.10.4 and 13.0.

### Workarounds

There's no workaround besides upgrading and being careful on which user should have Script right access. Note that any bruteforce attack on the authentication should be visible in the logs since the authentication failures are logged.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
