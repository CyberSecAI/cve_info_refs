## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

## Patched versions

stable >= 2.7.7; beta >= 2.8.0.beta4; tests-passed >= 2.8.0.beta4;

## Description

### Impact

There are two bugs which led to the post creator of a whisper post being revealed to non-staff users.

1. Staff users that creates a whisper post in a personal message is revealed to non-staff participants of the personal message even though the whisper post cannot be seen by them.
2. When a whisper post is before the last post in a post stream, deleting the last post will result in the creator of the whisper post to be revealed to non-staff users as the last poster of the topic.

### Patches

This issue is patched in the latest stable, beta and tests-passed versions of Discourse

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
