Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32788

**Description:** The vulnerability relates to the disclosure of a whisper post's creator in Discourse to non-staff users under specific circumstances.

**Root Cause:**
   1.  **Whisperer revealed in personal message participants list:** When a staff user creates a whisper post in a private message, the user is added to the topic's participants list, even though non-staff users cannot see the whisper post itself.
   2.  **Incorrect last poster assignment:** If a whisper post is present before the last post in a topic, and the last post is deleted, the topic's last poster can be incorrectly set to the user who created the whisper post.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
   - Information Disclosure: The system incorrectly exposes the creator of a whisper post to users who are not meant to see that information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
   -  Non-staff users can potentially learn the identity of the author of a whisper post, which is intended to be hidden from them.
   - This can lead to privacy violations where non-staff users gain information they should not have access to.

**Attack Vectors:**
   1.  A staff user creates a whisper post within a private message.
   2.  A user deletes the last post in a topic containing a previous whisper post.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Scenario 1:** The attacker needs to be a non-staff member involved in the personal message to view the participants list and the whisper post creator.
   - **Scenario 2:** The attacker needs to be a user with permissions to delete posts in a topic with a prior whisper post.

**Patches:**
   - The vulnerability is addressed in stable versions 2.7.7 and later, and beta/tests-passed versions 2.8.0.beta4 and later.

**CVSS Metrics:**
   -  CVSS v3 Base Score: 4.3
