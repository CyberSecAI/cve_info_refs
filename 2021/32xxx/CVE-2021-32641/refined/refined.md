Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-32641:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-controlled data within the `flashMessage` and `languageDictionary` features of the `auth0-lock` library. Specifically, when user input or data from URL parameters is directly incorporated into these features, it allows for the injection of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is a reflected XSS vulnerability. User-provided data is reflected back in the application's response without proper sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser.
*   **Insecure use of `flashMessage` and `languageDictionary`:** The `flashMessage` feature is used to display messages to the user, and the `languageDictionary` feature is used to customize the UI with localized text. The library did not sanitize the input to these features.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's session. This can lead to various malicious activities, including:
    *   **Session hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies or tokens.
    *   **Data theft:** Accessing sensitive user information or application data.
    *   **Account takeover:** Modifying user settings or taking over user accounts.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms.
    *   **Defacement:** Altering the appearance or behavior of the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **URL Parameters:** The primary attack vector involves manipulating URL parameters to inject malicious code into the `flashMessage` or `languageDictionary` properties.
*   **User Input:** Other sources of user input that are not properly sanitized before being used in `flashMessage` or `languageDictionary` may also be exploited.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to craft malicious URLs:** An attacker must be able to create malicious URLs that include the XSS payload within the query parameters.
*   **Social Engineering:** It is likely that the attacker would need to get the victim to click on a crafted link, for example, via phishing or social engineering.

**Mitigation:**

* The vulnerability is fixed in version `11.30.1` by using `DOMPurify` to sanitize the `flashMessage` and `languageDictionary` inputs.

**Additional details**

*   The provided commit diff shows that the fix involved sanitizing the input to these fields using `DOMPurify` to remove potentially malicious HTML or javascript.
*   The fix also converts SVG strings to SVG elements and sanitizes their usage to mitigate other XSS vulnerabilities.
