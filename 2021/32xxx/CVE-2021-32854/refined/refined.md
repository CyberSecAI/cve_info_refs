- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The textAngular text editor is vulnerable to cross-site scripting (XSS) via copy-paste. The editor does not properly sanitize HTML content pasted into it, allowing execution of embedded scripts.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The editor fails to sanitize pasted HTML, leading to the injection of malicious code.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation can lead to the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves a victim copying a malicious HTML payload (containing a script) from a separate source and pasting it into the textAngular editor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML payload. The attacker also needs to fool the victim into copying and pasting this payload into the vulnerable text editor.
