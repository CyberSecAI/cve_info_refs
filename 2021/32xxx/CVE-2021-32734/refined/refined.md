Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32734:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Nextcloud Text application was returning verbatim exception messages to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Information Disclosure: The application did not properly sanitize or handle exception messages, revealing internal file paths to users. This is a vulnerability that belongs to CWE-209: Generation of Error Message Containing Sensitive Information.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full Path Disclosure: An attacker could obtain the full server-side path of shared files. This reveals the directory structure of the Nextcloud installation, which may contain sensitive information about the system. For instance, an attacker could determine the username and specific locations of files within the storage system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- By interacting with the Nextcloud Text application and causing an exception, a malicious user could receive the full file path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a user of the Nextcloud instance and have the capability to trigger exceptions within the Text application. This may involve normal usage of the application in a way that causes an error.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in the Text applicationâ€™s handling of exceptions, which unintentionally leaks the full file path of shared files due to the inclusion of detailed, unfiltered error messages. This information could be used by an attacker to gain insights into the server's file structure and potential vulnerabilities.

The vulnerability was addressed in Nextcloud versions 19.0.13, 20.0.11, and 21.0.3.
