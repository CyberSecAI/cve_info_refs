The provided content is a commit diff for FreeRTOS kernel, specifically addressing improvements to heap bounds checking. While it doesn't explicitly describe a CVE, it details changes made to prevent potential memory corruption due to insufficient bounds checking during memory allocation.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from insufficient checks when allocating memory from the heap.  Specifically, the code was not properly checking for integer overflows during the calculation of the required memory size, which includes alignment and header overhead. This could lead to an undersized allocation and subsequent heap corruption.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** In multiple heap implementations (`heap_1.c`, `heap_2.c`, `heap_4.c`, and `heap_5.c`), the code calculates the total allocation size by adding the requested size, alignment padding, and structure overhead. The original code was vulnerable to an integer overflow during this size calculation. If the requested size was large enough, adding the header size and alignment could wrap around to a small value, leading to allocating less memory than needed.
- **Insufficient Bounds Checking:** Before the fix, the heap code was only checking whether `xNextFreeByte + xWantedSize` was less than `configADJUSTED_HEAP_SIZE`, but did not check if the result was still greater than the current allocation pointer, which can indicate an overflow. In the case of heap_2, _4 and _5 there were no checks for overflows, which could cause out-of-bounds writes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Heap Corruption:** An integer overflow vulnerability would lead to a smaller-than-expected memory allocation.  When the application uses the allocated memory, it could write beyond the allocated buffer, corrupting the heap metadata or other data in memory.
- **Unpredictable Behavior:** Heap corruption can cause unpredictable behavior, including system crashes, data corruption, and potentially denial-of-service situations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a call to `pvPortMalloc()` with a size that, when combined with the overhead, results in an integer overflow during the size calculation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control, or be able to influence the `xWantedSize` parameter passed to the `pvPortMalloc()` function to trigger the integer overflow condition.

**Changes made in the commit:**
- The commit adds explicit checks for integer overflows within the `pvPortMalloc` function in `heap_1.c`, `heap_2.c`, `heap_4.c`, and `heap_5.c`.
- In `heap_1.c` and checks for valid size are added as well.
- Specifically, checks were added when aligning the requested size as it's increased to ensure the addition does not cause an overflow
- The commit also includes additional assertions (`configASSERT`) to detect potential issues early in the development process.

**Summary of Improvements:**
The commit improves memory management by adding overflow checks and making the memory allocation more robust. This helps prevent heap corruption caused by integer overflows during size calculations, which leads to improved system stability and reliability.
