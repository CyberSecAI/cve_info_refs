| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1959911#c0)  Cedric Buissart    2021-05-12 15:32:55 UTC  ``` fill_mishblk() does not check the length of the read buffer, and copy 0xCC bytes from it. The length of the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound. This possibly leads to memory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in a chain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.  ``` 185 void fill_mishblk(char* c, struct _mishblk* m) 186 { 187     memset(m, 0, sizeof(struct _mishblk)); 188     memcpy(m, c, 0xCC); ``` In the above code, the memory allocated for `c` may be shorter than 0xCC bytes.  Upstream bug report : <https://github.com/Lekensteyn/dmg2img/issues/11>   ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=1959911#c1)  Cedric Buissart    2021-05-12 15:33:14 UTC  ``` Created dmg2img tracking bugs for this issue:  Affects: fedora-all [[bug 1959912](show_bug.cgi?id=1959912 "CLOSED EOL - CVE-2021-32614 dmg2img: OOB read in memcpy() for up to 204 bytes in fill_mishblk() [fedora-all]")]   ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=1959911#c2)  Cedric Buissart    2021-05-12 15:35:31 UTC  ``` Acknowledgments:  Name: Anshunkang Zhou   ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=1959911#c4)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-05-13 14:33:52 UTC  ``` This CVE Bugzilla entry is for community support informational purposes only as it does not affect a package in a commercially supported Red Hat product.

## Description

A flaw was found in dmg2img through 20170502. fill\_mishblk() does not check the length of the read buffer, and copy 0xCC bytes from it. The length of the buffer is controlled by an attacker. By providing a length smaller than 0xCC, memcpy reaches out of the malloc'ed bound. This possibly leads to memory layout information leaking in the data. This might be used in a chain of vulnerability in order to reach code execution.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
