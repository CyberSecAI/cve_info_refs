Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32614:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a missing bounds check in the `fill_mishblk()` function within the `dmg2img` utility. This function copies 0xCC (204) bytes from a provided buffer into a structure, without verifying if the buffer is actually that large.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-bounds read:** The `memcpy` operation in `fill_mishblk()` reads beyond the allocated buffer's boundaries when the provided buffer is smaller than 0xCC bytes.
- **Lack of input validation:** The function does not validate the size of the input buffer against the size of the copy operation, leading to the out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Leakage:** An attacker can cause `memcpy` to read beyond the allocated memory, potentially leaking memory layout information or other sensitive data.
- **Potential Code Execution:** Although not directly leading to code execution, the leaked memory information could be used in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A specially crafted input file processed by `dmg2img`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a crafted input file to `dmg2img` where the size of the buffer passed to `fill_mishblk` is less than `0xCC` bytes.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.
- User interaction is required to run the vulnerable utility with the crafted input.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is within `dmg2img.h`, line 188:
```c
void fill_mishblk(char* c, struct _mishblk* m)
{
    memset(m, 0, sizeof(struct _mishblk));
    memcpy(m, c, 0xCC);
}
```
- The `memcpy` copies 0xCC bytes from `c` to `m`, regardless of the actual size of memory pointed to by `c`.
- The issue was reported to the upstream project.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is classified as having a high severity, with a CVSS score of 7.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:H).
- The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have access to the system where `dmg2img` is executed.
- The vulnerability is categorized as a CWE-125 (Out-of-bounds read).
- The fix involves verifying the size of the input buffer before passing it to `memcpy`.
