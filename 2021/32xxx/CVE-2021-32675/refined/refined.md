Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32675:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Redis processes incoming Redis Standard Protocol (RESP) requests, specifically during the parsing of multi-bulk and bulk headers. The server allocates memory based on the values specified in these headers by the client, without proper validation or limits for unauthenticated connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Uncontrolled Memory Allocation:**  The lack of limits on the number of elements and size of elements in RESP request payloads for unauthenticated connections.
- **Denial of Service:** An attacker can exploit the uncontrolled memory allocation to exhaust server resources, leading to a denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful attack causes the Redis server to allocate an excessive amount of memory, potentially crashing the service and impacting availability.

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network:** The attack is carried out by sending specially crafted RESP request payloads over the network.
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The vulnerability can be exploited by unauthenticated users due to the lack of input sanitization for unauthenticated clients.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network access to the Redis server to send the malicious payloads.
- **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not require valid credentials to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Ability to Craft Malicious Payloads:** The attacker needs the ability to send a specially crafted RESP request payload with a large number of elements.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in the parsing of both multi-bulk headers (which determines the number of elements) and bulk headers (which defines the size of each element)
- The fix introduces low limits for multibulk and bulk length for unauthenticated connections, preventing the allocation of excessive memory
- The vulnerability affects Redis server, redis-cli, redis-sentinel tools as those share some common code.
