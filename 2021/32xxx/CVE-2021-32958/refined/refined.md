- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An authentication bypass vulnerability exists in Claroty Secure Remote Access (SRA) Site due to an alternate path or channel that can be used to bypass access controls.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Authentication bypass using an alternate path or channel (CWE-288).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with local system access can bypass access controls for the central configuration file of the SRA Site software. This allows them to gain the secret key, generate valid session tokens for the web user interface (UI), access assets managed by the SRA installation and potentially compromise the installation.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the Linux system hosting the SRA Site software is required.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local command line interface access to the system hosting the SRA Site software.
