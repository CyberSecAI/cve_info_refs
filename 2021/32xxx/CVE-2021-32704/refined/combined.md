# SQL Injection in DHIS2 Tracker API

High

[amcgee](/amcgee)
published
GHSA-fj38-585h-hxgj
Jun 24, 2021

## Package

dhis2-core

## Affected versions

2.34.4,2.35.2,2.35.3,2.35.4,2.36.0

## Patched versions

2.34.5,2.35.5,2.36.1

## Description

Improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command

('SQL Injection') vulnerability in the Tracker component in DHIS2 Server allows authenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary SQL commands via unspecified vectors.

### Impact

A **serious SQL injection security vulnerability** has been found in specific versions of DHIS2. This vulnerability affects the /api/trackedEntityInstances API endpoint in DHIS2 versions 2.34.4, 2.35.2, 2.35.3, 2.35.4, and 2.36.0.

Earlier versions, such as 2.34.3 and 2.35.1 and all versions 2.33 and older are unaffected.

The system is vulnerable to attack only from users that are logged in to DHIS2, and there is no known way of exploiting the vulnerability without first being logged in as a DHIS2 user.

The vulnerability is not exposed to a non-malicious user - the vulnerability requires a conscious attack to be exploited.

A successful exploit of this vulnerability could allow the malicious user to read, edit and delete data in the DHIS2 instance.

**There are no known exploits of the security vulnerabilities addressed by these patch releases.** However, we strongly recommend that all DHIS2 implementations using versions 2.34, 2.35 and 2.36 install these patches as soon as possible.

### Patches

Security patches are now available for the following DHIS2 versions:

v2.34.4 -- Update to v2.34.5

v2.35.2, v2.35.3, v2.35.4 -- Update to v2.35.5

v2.36.0 -- Update to v2.36.1

These patches address a critical security vulnerability. If your DHIS2 system is using one of the versions listed above, you should download and install the appropriate patch version immediately. All latest patch versions are available for download at [dhis2.org/downloads](https://dhis2.org/downloads/).

### Workarounds

There is no straightforward known workaround for DHIS2 instances using the Tracker functionality other than upgrading the affected DHIS2 server to one of the patches in which this vulnerability has been fixed. For implementations which do NOT use Tracker functionality, it may be possible to block all network access to POST to the /api/trackedEntityInstance endpoint as a temporary workaround while waiting to upgrade.

### References

These updates are the first product of the newly formed DHIS2 Security team. You can read more about the process for identifying and reviewing potential security vulnerabilities on our website: [dhis2.org/security](https://dhis2.org/security)

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
