{
  "CVE-2021-32052": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is due to the URLValidator in Django not prohibiting newlines and tabs in input on Python 3.9.5+, potentially leading to header injection attacks.",
    "root_cause": "The root cause is that the URLValidator in Django, on Python 3.9.5 and later, failed to sanitize newlines and tabs from URL inputs, which allowed them to be included in HTTP response headers.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Header injection vulnerability"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to header injection attacks. This could result in disclosure of sensitive information, or the addition/modification of data.",
     "attack_vectors": [
      "By including newline characters in the input processed by the vulnerable URLValidator, an attacker can inject malicious headers into an HTTP response."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to provide input strings with newlines and tabs to the vulnerable URLValidator.",
      "affected_products": [
        "Django versions 2.2 prior to 2.2.22, 3.1 prior to 3.1.10, and 3.2 prior to 3.2.2. This also includes the Django main branch.",
        "Multiple NetApp products incorporate Django"
      ],
    "additional_details": "The URLField form field, which uses URLValidator, silently removes newlines and tabs on Python 3.9.5+, so the vulnerability exists if the validator is used outside of the form fields. This issue was introduced by a fix in Python (bpo-43882) which allowed newlines in URLs."
