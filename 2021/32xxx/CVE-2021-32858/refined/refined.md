Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32858

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a flawed HTML sanitization implementation within the `esdoc-publish-html-plugin`. The sanitizer incorrectly parses HTML comments, specifically it only recognizes comments in the form of `<!-- comment -->`, but fails to recognize comments that look like `<!-- --!>`. This parsing error allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML by using this alternative comment format, tricking the sanitizer into not removing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **HTML Sanitizer Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the intended HTML sanitization. This allows the injection of arbitrary HTML code, which the sanitizer was designed to prevent.
- **Incorrect Comment Parsing:**  The sanitizer's flawed logic for identifying HTML comments is the core of the bypass. It assumes a specific format and doesn't handle variations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The most significant impact is the potential for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks. By injecting malicious JavaScript, an attacker can execute arbitrary scripts in the context of a user's browser. This allows an attacker to steal cookies, redirect users, or perform other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Markdown Input:** The vulnerability is triggered through the `markdown` function which processes user-supplied text, which can include specially crafted markdown comments to bypass the sanitizer.
- **HTML Injection via Comments:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload using the `<!-- --!>` comment format to embed malicious HTML content within the markdown, which is then processed by the vulnerable sanitizer.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Inject Markdown:** The attacker needs to be able to provide markdown input to the system that utilizes the vulnerable `esdoc-publish-html-plugin`.
- **Knowledge of the Sanitizer's Weakness:** The attacker must understand the sanitizer's flawed parsing logic regarding HTML comments to craft the specific bypass payload.

**Additional Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is located in `esdoc-publish-html-plugin/src/Builder/util.js`, specifically in the `markdown` function's sanitizer logic.
- The `sanitizer` function uses a regular expression `tag.match(/<!--.*-->/)` to identify HTML comments.
- The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how the sanitizer fails to remove `<script>` tags when embedded within a `<!-- --!>` comment.
