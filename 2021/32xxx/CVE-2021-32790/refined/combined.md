# Critical Vulnerability Detected in WooCommerce on July 13, 2021 – What You Need to Know

![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/22bd03ace6f176bfe0c593650bcf45d8?s=50&d=mm&r=g)
[News](https://woocommerce.com/news/)

![](https://woocommerce.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/Blog-Header-1920x580@2x1.jpg)

**Last Updated: July 23, 2021**

On July 13, 2021, a critical vulnerability concerning [WooCommerce](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woocommerce/) and the [WooCommerce Blocks](https://wordpress.org/plugins/woo-gutenberg-products-block/) feature plugin was identified and responsibly disclosed by security researcher [Josh](https://hackerone.com/jl-dos?type=user), via our [HackerOne security program](https://hackerone.com/automattic).

Upon learning about the issue, our team immediately conducted a thorough investigation, audited all related codebases, and created a patch to fix the issue for every impacted version (90+ releases) which was deployed automatically to vulnerable stores.

## [I have a WooCommerce store – what actions should I take?](#section-1)

[↑ Back to top](#doc-title "Back to top")

Automatic software updates to WooCommerce 5.5.1 began rolling out on July 14, 2021, to all stores running impacted versions of each plugin, but we still highly recommend you ensure that you’re using the latest version. For WooCommerce, this is **5.5.2**\* or the **highest number possible** in your [release branch](https://developer.woocommerce.com/releases). If you’re also running WooCommerce Blocks, you should be using version 5.5.1 of that plugin.

**Important**: With the release of WooCommerce 5.5.2 on July 23, 2021, the auto-update process mentioned above has been discontinued.

After updating to a patched version, we also recommend:

* Updating the passwords for any Admin users on your site, especially if they reuse the same passwords on multiple websites
* Rotating any Payment Gateway and WooCommerce API keys used on your site.

There’s more information about these steps below.

\* WooCommerce 5.5.2 was released on July 23, 2021. [The fixes contained in this version](https://developer.woocommerce.com/2021/07/23/woocommerce-5-5-2-fix-release/) are unrelated to the recent security vulnerability.

## [How do I know if my version is up-to-date?](#versions)

[↑ Back to top](#doc-title "Back to top")

The table below contains the full list of patched versions for both WooCommerce and WooCommerce Blocks. If you are running a version of WooCommerce or WooCommerce Blocks that is not on this list, please update immediately to the highest version in your release branch.

| **Patched WooCommerce versions** | **Patched WooCommerce Blocks versions** |
| --- | --- |
| 3.3.6 | 2.5.16 |
| 3.4.8 | 2.6.2 |
| 3.5.9 | 2.7.2 |
| 3.6.6 | 2.8.1 |
| 3.7.2 | 2.9.1 |
| 3.8.2 | 3.0.1 |
| 3.9.4 | 3.1.1 |
| 4.0.2 | 3.2.1 |
| 4.1.2 | 3.3.1 |
| 4.2.3 | 3.4.1 |
| 4.3.4 | 3.5.1 |
| 4.4.2 | 3.6.1 |
| 4.5.3 | 3.7.2 |
| 4.6.3 | 3.8.1 |
| 4.7.2 | 3.9.1 |
| 4.8.1 | 4.0.1 |
| 4.9.3 | 4.1.1 |
| 5.0.1 | 4.2.1 |
| 5.1.1 | 4.3.1 |
| 5.2.3 | 4.4.3 |
| 5.3.1 | 4.5.3 |
| 5.4.2 | 4.6.1 |
| 5.5.1 | 4.7.1 |
| 5.5.2 | 4.8.1 |
|  | 4.9.2 |
|  | 5.0.1 |
|  | 5.1.1 |
|  | 5.2.1 |
|  | 5.3.2 |
|  | 5.4.1 |
|  | 5.5.1 |

## [Why didn’t my website get the automatic update?](#section-3)

[↑ Back to top](#doc-title "Back to top")

Your site may not have automatically updated for a number of reasons, a few of the most likely are: you’re running a version prior to one impacted (below WooCommerce 3.3), automatic updates have been explicitly disabled on your site, your filesystem is read-only, or there are potentially conflicting extensions preventing the update.

In all cases (except the first example, where you are unaffected), you should attempt to manually update to the newest patched version on your release branch (e.g. 5.5.2, 5.4.2, 5.3.1, etc), as listed in the table above.

## [Has any data been compromised?](#section-4)

[↑ Back to top](#doc-title "Back to top")

Based on the current available evidence we believe any exploit was limited.

If a store was affected, the exposed information will be specific to what that site is storing but could include order, customer, and administrative information.

## [How can I check if my store was exploited?](#section-5)

[↑ Back to top](#doc-title "Back to top")

Due to the nature of this vulnerability, and the extremely flexible way that WordPress (and thus WooCommerce) allows web requests to be handled, there is no definitive way of confirming an exploit. You may be able to detect some exploit attempts by reviewing your web server’s access logs (or getting help from your web host to do so). Requests in the following formats seen between December 2019 and now likely indicate an attempted exploit:

* REQUEST\_URI matching regular expression `/\/wp-json\/wc\/store\/products\/collection-data.*%25252.*/`
* REQUEST\_URI matching regular expression `/.*\/wc\/store\/products\/collection-data.*%25252.*/` (note that this expression is not efficient/is slow to run in most logging environments)
* Any non-GET (POST or PUT) request to `/wp-json/wc/store/products/collection-data` or `/?rest_route=/wc/store/products/collection-data`

Requests that we have seen exploiting this vulnerability come from the following IP addresses, with over 98% coming from the first in the list. If you see any of these IP addresses in your access logs, you should assume the vulnerability was being exploited:

* `137.116.119.175`
* `162.158.78.41`
* `103.233.135.21`

## [Which passwords do I need to change?](#section-6)

[↑ Back to top](#doc-title "Back to top")

It’s unlikely that your password was compromised as it is [hashed](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptographic_hash_function).

WordPress user passwords are hashed using salts, which means the resulting hash value is very difficult to crack. This salted hash approach protects your password as an admin user, and also the passwords of any other users on your site, including customers. While it is possible the hashed version of your password stored in your database may have been accessed through this vulnerability, the hash value should be indiscernible and still protect your passwords from unauthorized use.

This assumes that your site is using the standard WordPress password management for users.  Depending on the plugins you’ve installed on your site you may have passwords or other sensitive information stored in less secure ways.

If any of the Administrator users on your site might have reused the same passwords on multiple websites we recommend you update those passwords in case their credentials have been compromised elsewhere.

We also recommend changing any private or secret data stored in your WordPress/WooCommerce database. This may include API keys, public/private keys for payment gateways and more, depending on your particular store configuration.

## [As an extension developer or service provider, should we alert our WooCommerce merchants?](#section-7)

[↑ Back to top](#doc-title "Back to top")

If you work with any live WooCommerce store or merchant, we encourage you to work with them to make sure they know about this issue, and/or update their store to a secure version.

If you have built an extension or offer a SaaS service that relies on the WooCommerce API, we encourage you to help merchants reset the keys to connect to your service.

## [As a store owner, should I alert my customers?](#section-8)

[↑ Back to top](#doc-title "Back to top")

Whether you alert your customers is ultimately up to you. Your obligations to notify customers or reset things like passwords will vary depending on details like your site infrastructure, where you and your customers are geographically located, what data your site is collecting, and whether or not your site has been compromised.

The most important action you can take to protect your customers is to update your version of WooCommerce to a version that has been patched with a fix for this vulnerability.

After updating, we recommend:

* Updating the passwords for any Administrator users on your site, especially if you reuse the same passwords on multiple websites
* Rotating any Payment Gateway and WooCommerce API keys used on your site.

As the store owner it is ultimately your decision whether you want to take additional precautions such as resetting your customers’ passwords. WordPress (and thus WooCommerce) user passwords are hashed using salts, which means the resulting hash value is very difficult to crack. This salted hash approach is applied to all user passwords on your site, including your customers’ passwords.

## [Is WooCommerce still safe to use?](#section-9)

[↑ Back to top](#doc-title "Back to top")

Yes.

Incidents like this are uncommon, but do unfortunately sometimes happen. Our intention is always to respond immediately and operate with complete transparency.

Since learning of the vulnerability, the team has worked around the clock to ensure that a fix has been put in place, and our users have been informed.

Our continued investment in platform security allows us to prevent the vast majority of issues – but in the rare cases that could potentially impact stores, we strive to fix quickly, communicate proactively, and work collaboratively with the WooCommerce Community.

## [What if I still have questions?](#section-10)

   This vulnerability affected sites without blocks installed? Did you send warnings to all sites affected? (I don’t know if I was, I’ve updated my sites to 5.5.1 manually after reading this post) thanks!!!

     Hi, Daniel.

     > This vulnerability affected sites without blocks installed?

     Yes, WooCommerce versions 3.3 to 5.5.

     > Did you send warnings to all sites affected?

     We sent out [an email](https://mailchi.mp/woocommerce/action-required-critical-vulnerability-woocommerce) to our mailing list as well.

     > I’ve updated my sites to 5.5.1 manually after reading this post) thanks!!!

       Ok, if i didn’t receive a personalized mail or automatic update to my site(hosted outside wordpress.com) it means that wasn’t affected in the meantime(1 day) between 5.5 update and 5.5.1 manual update?

         Unfortunately your store still may have been vulnerable in that timeframe.

         We can only email users who have opted-in to our mailing list, and auto-updates aren’t always possible.

         However, now that you have updated, you are running the patched version.

           Ok, but you’ll disclose a way to check if the site was attacked?(verifying our logs or any other way?) Do we need to changes admin passwords just in case?

           Sorry for asking, but as merchants is very worrying, iv’e updated an hour ago when you published the notice in social media.

           Thanks in advance to the woo team!

           Out of caution it is a good idea to update your passwords after installing the pached version.

           We will be sharing more information with site owners on how to investigate this security vulnerability on their site, which we will publish on our blog when it is ready.

           You mention updating passwords along with updating to the patched version. Can you provide more detail of which passwords? Are you referring to WordPress Admin passwords? Payment processor passwords? Thank you!

         Hi Alex,

         If you’re running WooCommerce 5.4.1 you should update to 5.4.2.

         We’re still investigating the issue, and will share more information on our blog when we’re able to do so.

       How can I update WooCommerce when I get this warning? No guarantee the site will still work. I’ve been avoiding updates for a while. And now this vulnerability alert from you. What do you suggest I (we) do?

       The following active plugin(s) have not declared compatibility with WooCommerce 5.0 yet and should be updated and examined further before you proceed:

       Plugin Tested up to WooCommerce version

       WooCommerce Table Rate Shipping 4.5

       Plug’n Pay Direct Gateway for WooCommerce unknown

       As this is a major update, we strongly recommend creating a backup of your site before updating.

         Hi Knox,

         An updated version of WooCommerce containing the security patch has been made available for each release branch, which should negate the need for a major update at this time.

         For example, if you’re using 4.9.2, you can update to the patched version in that branch – 4.9.3 – instead of jumping straight to 5.0.1 or higher.

         You can find a list of all patched versions in the table above – if you’re currently running one of these versions, then you do not need to update. If you’re not using a patched version, you can find a direct download for each release branch on this page: <https://developer.woocommerce.com/releases/>.

         You should not update to WooCommerce 5.0 as this is not a secure version.

         Thanks,

     Hi, John.

     Yes!

     We provided the patch to WordPress.org and automatic software updates are rolling out now to all stores running impacted versions of each plugin.

     However, we’re urging everyone check and manually update if needed just in case.

       Recommandez-vous de passer à une autre plate-forme au lieu de WooCommerce car elle est toujours piratée. Il a des trous de sécurité. Et personne du support ne s’en soucie car c’est gratuit.

     Unless i’m misunderstanding, I don’t think a forced updated is possible on self-hosted/Wordpress.org sites, right? To be safe I just went all the way up to 5.5.1 on everything I manage, although the new point releases for each branch released today should have the patch, according to this page: <https://developer.woocommerce.com/releases/>

       @Chris, it’s a little known and rarely used capability of the WordPress security team. They pushed a forced update for the loginizer plugin in October of last year and it looks as though they’ll do the same for this one

       Automattic security team has the ability to force update on themes and plugins – there is such solution implemented in update system.

       It has been already used few times, AFAIR.

       Just hours before your announcement and email, the site I manage saw a massive spike in network traffic before effectively locking out administrative logins and presenting various bizarre messages. When I SSH’d into the live environment, the console reported that there were 4 failed login attempts since my last login. So far as I could tell there was no apparent vandalism and the failed logins had their IP banned. It seems a little too coincidental.

       Is there any information you can share that could help me (or other concerned bystanders) to forensically determine if we were impacted? Maybe some diagnostic error log messages or URL patterns?

         Hi there,

         The team is still investigating the issue, and will share more details as soon as they’re able to do so.

         In the meantime, please ensure that you’re running the latest version of WooCommerce in your release branch and update any admin passwords

         Thanks,

     Hi, Stef.

     From what we know at this time only WooCommerce (versions 3.3 to 5.5) and the WooCommerce Blocks feature plugin (versions 2.5 to 5.5) are affected.

     I’d also suggest notifying your merchants to make sure they’ve updated.

     Thank you!

         Those are both patched versions, so you are safe from this vulnerability. If you are running the Blocks plugin separately, we do suggest you always keep it on the latest version since the only reason to run it separately is to get more recent features. If you don’t need that, then you can just uninstall the separate Blocks plugin, since a stable version is always bundled with WooCommerce Core now.

    I can’t update. I started to update from my phone, but it fails. Also, tried moving the Autoupdate slider from Off to On, but it keeps sliding back to Off. On the computer I went to my website, but get “Briefly unavailable for scheduled maintenance. Check back in a minute.” 15 minutes now. I filled out a support ticket, but maybe you can let others know what to do in this situation.

      I’m sure our support team will be able to help you figure out what’s going on.

      If you can FTP into your site, or access the file manager through your host’s control panel, find the file called maintenance.php and delete it. It will be it the main hierarchy of your site, inside the httpdocs directory, or where you find the wp-content, wp-admin, etc. directories. Try updating again after that. If you still can’t update, certainly reach out to Woocommerce or your host, but if it were me, I’d back up the plugin and then reinstall it.

      Hope that helps.

        Thanks Kevin, I reached out to my support team, but I’m not sure how many hours I will have to wait for them to get this resolved.

        Thanks David, before I could track down that php file, the site returned from maintenance mode. However, the WooCommerce plugin had disappeared. I tried to reinstall, but that failed.

          Fixed it. I renamed the WC installation and recovered my plugins, including WC, from a backup. I didn’t realize the restore would wipe the directory, so for anyone in my position, move the renamed WC folder outside the plugins folder in case you need it. In my case, the restore worked, and then I updated WC to 5.5.1. Things appear to be working.

            Woke up to a similar situation. Website was on maintenance mode (from Plesk), after disabling maintenance mode and login to the WP admin backend I was greeted with errors that Woocommerce was missing. Under plugins, no WC visible. Could not upload the plugin via the backend for a reinstall, some generic error.

            Checked via FTP and the WC folder was totally missing from plugins directory. Extracted the latest version and uploaded it manually to this directory. After that everything was fine again. I’ve got auto updates enabled for every plugin, first time it caused havoc to be honest.

Do I still need to update to 5.5.1? – when I try to, I get a major update warning and it shows the majority of my plugins say that haven’t been tested past version 3.2-4.5 etc ..so am I good to leave it as is? – or do I need to install 5.5.1?

      This specific vulnerability is patched in that version, yes.

      That being said, that is a \*very\* old version of WooCommerce, so we would strongly suggest that you explore a path to being to update. This is an extreme case where we “backported” a security fix back to many previous versions, but we constantly release improvements to security, performance, and functionality, which normally only ship in the latest version usually (5.5.1 as of right now).

          Hi Derek,

          I wouldn’t personally say to update from 3.4.8 up to 5.5.1 without testing this first say on a staging copy of your current site. If your host doesn’t offer that option, we’d recommend [WP Staging](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-staging/) for quickly spinning up a new test site.

          Lots has changed from WooCommerce 3.4.8, like template files, functions, etc… so the chances are higher you would run into compatibility issues if your other extensions weren’t also updated for WooCommerce 5+ compatibility.

          The important thing is that now your store is secure from this known vulnerability and you have the time to plan and test updating to the latest version of WooCommerce. 🙂

      blocking access to the API without being authenticated prevents the exploit.

      as for IOC’s its a GET request, so there will be logs showing it being exploited in the web server (nginx or apache) logs.

      We’re currently still investigating the issue, and will share details on our blog when we’re able to do so.

      > is there any way to audit whether this attack has been performed on your site?

      If your store keeps request logs, you can check this log to find out if anything looks unusual. If you’re not sure if this is possible on your store, you can chat with your hosting company about this.

      We will be sharing more information with site owners on how to investigate this security vulnerability on their site, which we will publish on our blog when it is ready.

      > Do you suggest any other mitigation other than the update?

      At present, no. We will be contacting store owners directly if any further action is required.

      That’s rough man… I would suggest a couple of things:

      1. Revert your files (\*\*NOT THE DATABASE\*\*) to the backed up version.

      2. Update to the latest version in your branch by downloading the .zip here: <https://developer.woocommerce.com/releases/>

      Extract manually via the server to update.

      3. Use Wordfence (free version) to scan the site – it’s good at detecting malware and modified files.

      3a. IF Wordfence finds some bad files, you’ve got problems – try and scan your logs to see what IP address was accessing them, then search your database to see if there are any matching sessions, and check the user\_id (indicating a weak password on a user-account).

      3b. Delete the files, and scan again until clean.

    I had version 5.4.1, wordpress gives me the version 5.4.2 to update (not 5.5.1)

    why wordpress won´t mention ver 5.5.1 to me?

    what depends on the update process?…

    I thought we were always going to the latest version,

    (I thought I was up to date with my version until yesterday that I got your email)

    why will it be ok to update to 5.4.2 if there is 5.5.1 (even thou is not present in my updates page…)

      WooCommerce 5.4.2 is the correct version to update to based on your release branch, and contains the security patch.

    Is the vulnerability there if Woocommerce or Woocommerce blocks files are present but the plugin is deactivated? We’re a hosting company and we have a bunch of customers who have inactive woocommerce plugins in their codebases. I assume they tried it at one point then changed their minds or something…

    are those deactivated plugin files safe or do they also need to be updated?

    Thank you for all your hard work!

      Hi Damien,

      Deactivated plugin files are safe, but we do still recommend updating to the latest version in case any of your customers decide to reactivate them again in the future.

    Hi!

    I have an auto-update feature on for all my plugins and when I got the email notif earlier, I checked the plugin and it has been automatically updated to version 5.5.1. I’m not sure how instant the auto-update feature on wordpress is but should I be concerned that I might have gotten compromised or does the vulnerability only occur to outdated plugins?

    Thanks!

      Excellent. Ensuring that you’re running the latest version of WooCommerce available is the recommended course of action right now.

      Hi Suneth,

      Updating to the latest branch version should avoid this problem. For example, if you’re running 5.4.1, updating to 5.4.2). This shouldn’t conflict with any customizations unless you’ve made them inside the WooCommerce plugin (which we strongly recommend against doing).

      I hope that helps,

      5.2.2 is not a patched version, so you’ll need to update this to 5.2.3.

          As this critical vulnerability concerns the WooCommerce plugin, we highly recommend ensuring this is up to date first.

          The version you mention, 4.8.1, contains the security patch so there’s nothing else you need to do here until you’re ready to update to the latest version (5.5.1).

      Hi Janet,

      Yes, 3.1.2 is unaffected. However, that is a \*very\* old version of WooCommerce, so we would strongly recommend that you explore a path to being up to date.

      This is an extreme case where we “backported” a security fix back to many previous versions, but we constantly release improvements to security, performance, and functionality, which normally only ship in the latest version usually (5.5.1 as of right now).

    Adding a sales pitch into this warning makes it a little odd. “Would you like to avoid doing these updates manually in the future? Add the Smart Plugin Manager: <https://my.wpengine.com/products/smart_plugin_manager> to your plan today! ” I think this really weakens the alert status and many clients saw this as a sales opp bundled with a WC issue. How critical is this?

    I’m using a modified version of woocommerce 3.7 (so I can’t just update it straight away). Just to be sure I fixed manually the vulnerability, was the vulnerability located in woocommerce\includes\data-stores\class-wc-webhook-data-store.php and the risk was SQL injection right because you skipped the usage of $wpdb->prepare for the search query right?

      Oliver Jones, I’m sure bureaucracy is the last thing on their mind. In fact, it’s the complete opposite of bureaucracy why this was fixed this so fast.

      That’s not it. that’s XSS. This one’s a SQL Injection vulnerability and apparently has not yet been assigned a CVE number yet, according to reports on security sites like WordFence and others. If it had been assigned then it would have been cited in reports. This is not unusual when something is happening this fast.

    Hi i have another problem – i updated Woocommerce to the latest version and my woocommerce germanized plugin is active, but:

    Germanized is inactive. This version of Germanized requires WooCommerce 3.9 or newer. Please update WooCommerce to version 3.9 or newer »

    Can you help me?

      Hi, Alex!

      The newest version of WooCommerce is 5.5.1, which is quite a bit newer than 3.9.

      Is it possible there’s a newer version of Germanized that is also updated for newer versions of WooCommerce?

      What was the solution after you contacted woocommerce directly? This is ONE of the problems I’m having. I was almost starting to wonder if I’d been compromised, but bandwidth to my site is below 3MB for the past 24 hours so if I’m compromised, it’s a sleeper that takes up bytes.

    This looks more serious than I thought it to be initially. Are there specific countries that perhaps, may have been more vulnerable to this or? Should we also alert our users to change their password or admin-level password changes are enough?

      Hi there, thanks for your questions.

      Whether you alert your users to change their password is ultimately your decision to make. Your obligations to notify customers or reset things like passwords will vary depending on things like your site infrastructure, where you and your customers are geographically located, what data your site is collecting, and whether or not your site has been compromised.

      We will be sharing more information with site owners on how to check their own site, which we will publish on our blog when it is ready.

      Our investigations so far have not indicated any specific countries or regions are more vulnerable than any others.

    I’m running WooCommerce 3.9.4 according to “WooCommerce->Status” menu. Is this a correct place to check the version?

    The release date of 3.9.4 under the Woo “Releases” page is 2021-07-14″.

    So I have to update to the 2021-07-14 release, correct?

    The release is a zip file. Can I just install as a “Add New” plug in on top of the existing? Or do I uninstall the existing first?

      Hi there. That’s correct. Uploading a .zip file to update a plugin that’s already present is a functionality that was added in WordPress 5.5. If you’re using an older version of WordPress, then this will not work.

      You can delete WooCommerce and then upload version 3.9.4. The WooCommerce data and settings are stored in your database and not in the plugin files. That said, it’s always a good idea to first make a backup.

      I understand your frustration here, Joe. Is it possible for you to roll back to a previous version using a site backup?

      If so, I’d recommend doing so and then first updating to the highest version number in your [release branch](https://developer.woocommerce.com/releases/) first before updating to WooCommerce 5.5.1 (for example: If your store is running WooCommerce 4.8, first update to WooCommerce 4.8.1).

      If your site is still down and you’re unable to access your site via the front-end to make changes, here’s how you can access it via FTP:

        I was already at the highest release, 5.5 I think

        Having to roll back an entire site because of a single plugin is a last resort. It always causes other issues when this step is taken.

        I have 500’s, white screens, and multiple access errors killing my site.

        Practical advice would be appreciated rather than the generic “use a backup”

    Would it be possible to manually apply the patch? And if yes, would there be a script to follow? The goal is to apply the patch without affecting customized code.

    One site runs WC 3.7.0 with customization code. After updating to 3.7.2, the whole product section broke. So it has to be restored to the vulnerable state.

      Hi, Young.

      We don’t have a manual patch at this time.

      You may need to contact your developer who applied the custom code and have them update for you.

      Also a good idea to have a look at some best practices when adding custom code so not to run into this in the future!

    I’m using WC 2.6.4. I outsourced to build my e-commerce store and several angular based custom templates and few custom plugins are built and functioning on my site.

    Previously, I tested updating WooCommerce in staging, and it messed up all the custom angular templates and plugins. So we can’t update WooCommerce right away.

    May I know like even the WC 2.6.4 has the same vulnerability? And can you provide a patch for that? ’cause it’ll take time for me to update all the templates and custom plugins.

      Hi there,

      This issue only affects WooCommerce versions 3.3 to 5.5 and the WooCommerce Blocks feature plugin versions 2.5 to 5.5.

      That is quite an old version of WooCommerce however, so working with your developer to update would be a good idea!

      Thanks!

    How long does it take to update? Mine is updating for more than an hour now and nothing is happening. When I open my dashboard in a new page the complete woocommerce plugin is gone. What is happening? Can anyone help me?

      How strange!

      The time it takes to update would depend mostly on your hosting provider – the update should be fairly quick.

      If the WooCommerce plugin is still gone, I’d download the newest version and install it again manually.

     I’m amazed that so many people don’t keep their plugins up-to-date. WordPress Site Health always flags any non-updates as a risk! Don’t people use the Site Health tool?!

     Hi! I have a store that’s running on WordPress version 3.7.2 (before the critical vulnerability was detected). It’s still on version 3.7.2. I tried updating my store to the newest version of WordPress and several things stopped working. My question is, do I even need to update anything? I see that version 3.7.2 is a patched version…

       I assume you mean WooCommerce 3.7.2? 🙂

       If so, yes, that is a patched version and you’re safe from this issue.

     I have noticed on a new store I setup that when I go to the checkout for a payment a pop up page loads before the checkout, and the url does not change, the popup asks for credit card details. I entered in garbage and hit submit, and the page disappears and the checkout is then left empty. The form which loads is the following html:

     Is this related? I haven’t seen this pop up before, on a similar store. I updated WooCommerce to 5.5.1 but the same pop up is still appearing. I came here to open a ticket but I can’t possibly because I haven’t setup my account correctly.

       That doesn’t sound related to this issue.

       Best thing is to [submit a support ticket](https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/) – have you created an account on WooCommerce.com? That’s the best way to get in touch so we can help you work through the issue.

       4.5.3 is indeed a patched version, so it is safe to use.

       However, we do recommend working towards using the latest version of WooCommerce. You can find out how to do this safely here: <https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/how-to-update-woocommerce/>

     My site automatically updated to WooCommerce 5.5.1, but it’s been affected site speed dramatically…to the point where I’m getting time out errors whilst trying to do simple things like edit a product. I created a duplicate copy of my site on my server…deactivated all the plugins and changed to Storefront theme. The problem persisted. Rolled back to 5.5.0…still have the problem, but roll back to 5.4.2 and all is good….. has a security patch been put in place for 5.4.2 for me to use it ???

       We’re strongly recommending that you update your website immediately if it isn’t already using a patched version.

       The team has released security patches for WooCommerce versions 3.3 – 5.5, and so at the moment, you just need to ensure that you’re running on the latest version for your release branch.

     This destroyed my server. My host and I have been troubleshooting for over 24 hours. This turfed my server so bad that I can’t even restore from backup. If I find a way to restore my backup, I’ll be staying on the vulnerable edition and blocking the vulnerability with my WAF.

     I’m a reseller host, and my host is on google. My support department is working with my hosts support department who are working together with google support. This update for the critical vulnerability unleashes several hard to stop processes that just hang the server.

     We updated as soon as we got the email and have been experiecing issues since.

     When trying to process orders it just spins until we get a 504 Timeout error although it does normally update the order this is very time consuming. this also happens in other areas of the backend on the website.

     Is there a suggested solution for this?

       This affects WooCommerce versions 3.3 – 5.5, regardless of whether you’re using Gutenberg or Classic Press. It’s therefore really important that you upgrade to the patched version in your release branch.

       The team is still investigating this issue and we will release more details as soon as we’re able to do so.

     My site now reports the dreaded 500 error and I am looking to rolling any changes back

     Could you confirm if there was there a forced update and at what date/time and was it to a file within the woocommmerce folder(s) or was it a database update.

     Thanks

       Hi Mike,

       On July 14, WordPress.org rolled out an automatic security update to websites running versions of WooCommerce that had been identified as being affected by a critical vulnerability. I’m afraid we’re unable to identify the exact time this happened, but you can check whether you’re running a patched version of WooCommerce using the table in the blog post.

       If you are manually re-installing the WooCommerce and/or WooCommerce blocks plugins, we do recommend that you install the latest version within the release branch you had on your site prior to the update. So for instance, if you had WooCommerce 5.4.1, then you would want to install 5.4.2. You can find all the relevant versions in the table listed in the above post.

       If you continue to experience problems, please do reach out to our team of Happiness Engineers who will be able to assist you: <https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/>

       Thanks,

     Hi

     I have a client with a mothballed Woocommerce site version 3.0.7 which is currently activated but not used ie used for historical reference only and as such there requiredmentt for an updated version at this stage.

     Understand deactivating reduces the risk but the leading question is:

     Is this version vulnerable?

     Thanks

     SI DESACTIVO VUESTRO PLUGIN EL ERROR SE CORRIGE.

     1 / SE HA DETECTADO UNA SESION PHP ABIERTA.

     Se ha creado una sesión PHP por la llamada a la función session\_start(). Esto interfiere con la API REST y las solicitudes de retorno. La sesión debería ser cerrada por session\_write\_close() antes de hacer cualquier solicitud HTTP.

     2 / LA API REST HA ENCONTRADO UN ERROR

     La API REST es una forma en que WordPress y otras aplicaciones se comunican con el servidor. Un ejemplo es la pantalla del editor de bloques, que se basa en esto para mostrar y guardar tus publicaciones y páginas.

     Ha fallado la solicitud a la API REST debido a un error.

     Error: cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 10000 milliseconds with 0 bytes received (http\_request\_failed)

           Hi Mike,

           Uploading a .zip file to update a plugin that’s already present is a functionality that was added in WordPress 5.5, so for older versions, you’ll need to do the following:

           You can delete WooCommerce and then upload version 3.6.5. The WooCommerce data and settings are stored in your database and not in the plugin files, so your settings, products, and orders should all stay in place. That said, it’s always a good idea to first make a backup.

           Thanks,

       I’ve just checked with the team, and they mentioned that you could still be seeing this message because you have an unpatched version of WooCommerce Blocks installed.

       Would you be able to check whether you’re also running this plugin, and if so, ensure that it’s updated to use one of the versions of WooCommerce Blocks listed in the table above, please?

     Can someone let me know if this “vulnerability” is related to the huge numbers of fake orders we have had over the past few days?

     Is that what the issue was causing?

     We have updated to the latest versions of WordPress and Woo-Commerce but the problem has persisted.

     We have taken the general anti-spam precautions in settings, have Capthcha installed and Wordfence – but we are still having this problem – always with Handepay orders.

     Can anyone advise?

       WooCommerce 5.4.2 and WooCommerce Blocks 5.3.2 are both updated versions that contain the security patch, so you’re already covered 🙂

       Hi Nenad,

       If your website is using the most recent version of WooCommerce or one of the patched versions listed above, then no data would’ve been leaked because of this vulnerability – even if there are requests from malicious IPs.

       The patch rolled out by us does not block the IP, but fixes the underlying vulnerability.

       For peace of mind, you can block all of the IPs in the list above.

       Hello!

       Yes, it is very important that you update WooCommerce to a patched version as soon as possible.

       Patches have been released for versions 3.3 – 5.5, so instead of going straight from 3.9.0 to 5.5.2, you can upgrade to 3.9.4. This would eliminate the need to upgrade your WordPress version. If you’re still having difficulties, you can manually download the zip file for this version here: <https://developer.woocommerce.com/releases/>

       That being said, if you are using WordPress 5.4.0, this is an insecure version of WordPress, and at a minimum, should be updated to version 5.4.2. More details here: <https://wordpress.org/news/2020/06/wordpress-5-4-2-security-and-maintenance-release/>

         Hi Jaina,

         WooCommerce 3.1.2 was not an affected version, and 3.3.6 is a patched version, so either is safe to continue using.

         That being said, both are very old versions of WooCommerce, and we do recommend working towards updating to the latest version. More information on how to do this safely can be found here: <https://docs.woocommerce.com/document/how-to-update-woocommerce/>.

     Anybody experienced product checkout process issues? We are having issue with product total. Subtotal seems ok but total will be zero. Also its not updating customer shipping info in order details.

     Tried different them, removing WooCommerce tables and installing plugin again etc. nothing seems to work

       Hi Tinku,

       This doesn’t sound like it’s related to the vulnerability issue detailed above.

       Your best course of action to resolve this would therefore be to reach out to our support team. You can open a ticket via this link: <https://woocommerce.com/my-account/create-a-ticket/>

       Or, you can create a post on the support forum: <https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/woocommerce/>

       Thanks,

       Laura

     A new administrator account has been created on one of the domains on which woocommerce is installed. A new file was also automatically created each time it was deleted. I send the content of the file in pastebin – pastebin[dot]pl/view/c22ec65a. Disabling woocommerce stopped the automatic creation of the unwanted file

       Hi Ridhwan,

       4.8.0 is not an updated version of WooCommerce, so you will need to upgrade to a patched version ASAP.

       You don’t need to jump straight to 5.5.1, there’s a patched version in your release branch (4.8.1) that you can update to instead.

       A full list of patched versions has been included in the blog post above, please make sure you update to one of those as soon as you can.

       Thanks,

       Laura

     I am on 3.5.9 and can’t upgrade. No problem, just download the patched version of 3.5.9 and manually update, right?

     I unzipped the patched version and did a unix diff -qr against what I already have in my plugin/woocommerce dir. The only difference found is three image files:(new in the patch)

     woocommerce/assets/images/eway-logo.jpg

     woocommerce/assets/images/storefront-bg.jpg

     woocommerce/assets/images/wcs-canada-post-logo.jpg

     So there’s no code difference in the patch vs what I have? Do I need to copy those image over to my production area? THANKS!

       Hi there,

       WooCommerce 3.5.9 is already a patched version, so there’s no need to manually update! If you didn’t manually update to 3.5.9 yourself, it’s likely your website was included in the automatic security update we rolled out last month.

       Thanks,

       Laura

# Blind SQL Injection possible via Authenticated Web-hook Search API Endpoint

Critical

Jul 23, 2021

## Package

composer

woocommerce/woocommerce
([Composer](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Acomposer))

## Affected versions

>= 3.3

## Patched versions

> 5.5.1, 5.5.1, 5.4.2, 5.3.1, 5.2.3, 5.1.1, 5.0.1, 4.9.3, 4.8.1, 4.7.2, 4.6.3, 4.5.3, 4.4.2, 4.3.4, 4.2.3, 4.1.2, 4.0.2, 3.9.4, 3.8.2, 3.7.2, 3.6.6, 3.5.9, 3.4.8, 3.3.6

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability impacts all WooCommerce sites running 3.3.0 or later of the WooCommerce plugin. Malicious actors (already) having admin access, or API keys to the WooCommerce site can exploit vulnerable endpoints of `/wp-json/wc/v3/webhooks`, `/wp-json/wc/v2/webhooks` and other webhook listing API. Read-only SQL queries can be executed using this exploit, while data will not be returned, by carefully crafting `search` parameter information can be disclosed using timing and related attacks.
