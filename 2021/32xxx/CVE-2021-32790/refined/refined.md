Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**1. Verification of CVE relevance**

The content directly references CVE-2021-32790 and provides information that matches the official CVE description and related blog posts. This content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Root cause of the vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a **Blind SQL Injection** in the WooCommerce plugin.
- It stems from the usage of the `search` parameter in the Webhook search API endpoint.
- The code was not properly sanitizing and escaping the input passed via the `search` parameter, specifically within the `WC_Webhook_Data_Store` class.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities present:**

- **SQL Injection:**  The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization and escaping of the `search` parameter, allowing for the injection of malicious SQL queries.
- **Blind SQL Injection:** The exploit doesn't directly return data but allows attackers to infer data through timing-based attacks.

**4. Impact of exploitation:**

- **Information Disclosure:** While direct data retrieval is not possible, attackers can extract sensitive information by observing response times of carefully crafted SQL injection payloads. This is considered a blind SQL injection.
- **Potential for Privilege Escalation:** While not explicitly stated, if an attacker can use the SQL injection to alter or insert data, this could potentially be used for further malicious activity.
- **Unauthorized access to data:** Depending on the information stored, customer, order and admin data could be at risk.

**5. Attack vectors:**

- **Web-based API Endpoints:** The vulnerability lies in specific API endpoints related to webhooks, particularly: `/wp-json/wc/v3/webhooks` and `/wp-json/wc/v2/webhooks` .
- **Authenticated Attack:** Exploitation requires an attacker to have either administrator access to the WordPress site or possess valid API keys.

**6. Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Authenticated access:** The attacker needs to be authenticated as either an admin user or using valid API keys to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable API endpoints:** Attackers need to know the specific webhook API endpoints are vulnerable to perform the injection.
- **Ability to craft SQL queries:** Attackers need to create malicious SQL queries to be injected into the vulnerable search parameter.
