# Basic-auth app bundle credential exposure in gatsby-source-wordpress

High

[mlgualtieri](/mlgualtieri)
published
GHSA-rqjw-p5vr-c695
Jul 15, 2021

## Package

npm

gatsby-source-wordpress
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<4.0.8; <5.9.2

## Patched versions

4.0.8; 5.9.2

## Description

### Impact

The gatsby-source-wordpress plugin prior to versions 4.0.8 and 5.9.2 leaks .htaccess HTTP Basic Authentication variables into the app.js bundle during build-time. Users who are not initializing basic authentication credentials in the gatsby-config.js are not affected.

Example affected gatsby-config.js:

```
      resolve: 'gatsby-source-wordpress',
        auth: {
          htaccess: {
            username: leaked_username
            password: leaked_password,
          },
        },

```
### Patches

A patch has been introduced in gatsby-source-wordpress@4.0.8 and gatsby-source-wordpress@5.9.2 which mitigates the issue by filtering all variables specified in the `auth: { }` section. Users that depend on this functionality are advised to upgrade to the latest release of gatsby-source-wordpress, run `gatsby clean` followed by a `gatsby build`.

### Workarounds

There is no known workaround at this time, other than manually editing the app.js file post-build.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
