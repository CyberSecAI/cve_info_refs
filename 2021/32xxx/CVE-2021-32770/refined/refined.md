Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32770

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The `gatsby-source-wordpress` plugin incorrectly includes HTTP Basic Authentication credentials, specified in the `gatsby-config.js` file, into the generated `app.js` bundle during the build process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Exposure of sensitive credentials (username and password) within the client-side JavaScript bundle (`app.js`).
- Improper handling of authentication parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Unauthorized access to the WordPress instance that was protected by Basic Authentication. An attacker can extract the credentials and bypass authentication.
- Confidentiality breach of WordPress site protected by Basic Authentication.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attacks since the `app.js` bundle is typically served via HTTP(S).
- Attackers only require access to the deployed website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  An attacker needs network access to retrieve the app.js file generated by Gatsby.
-  No specific user interaction or privileges are needed.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability occurs only when HTTP Basic Authentication is configured in `gatsby-config.js` using the `auth.htaccess` parameters.
- The fix involves filtering variables specified in the `auth` section of the configuration to prevent them from being included in the bundle.
- The `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N` score indicates that this vulnerability has a high confidentiality impact with low complexity and no user interaction.
- There are no CWEs mentioned.
