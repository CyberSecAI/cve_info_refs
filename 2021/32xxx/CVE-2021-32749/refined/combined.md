Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-a18b79d182
2021-10-29 22:48:33.391723
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : fail2ban
Product : Fedora 35
Version : 0.11.2
Release : 9.fc35
URL : <http://fail2ban.sourceforge.net/>
Summary : Daemon to ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
Description :
Fail2Ban scans log files and bans IP addresses that makes too many password
failures. It updates firewall rules to reject the IP address. These rules can
be defined by the user. Fail2Ban can read multiple log files such as sshd or
Apache web server ones.

Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentications attempts
however it cannot eliminate the risk that weak authentication presents.
Configure services to use only two factor or public/private authentication
mechanisms if you really want to protect services.

This is a meta-package that will install the default configuration. Other
sub-packages are available to install support for other actions and
configurations.

# Possible RCE vulnerability in mailing action using mailutils (mail-whois)

High

[sebres](/sebres)
published
GHSA-m985-3f3v-cwmm
Jul 16, 2021

## Package

action.d/mail-whois + mailutils
(mailing action)

## Affected versions

<= 9.7, <= 10.6, <= 11.2

## Patched versions

0.10.7, 0.11.3

## Description

### Discovered-by

Jakub Å»oczek

### Impact

Possible remote code execution vulnerability in mailing action mail-whois

### Summary

Command `mail` from mailutils package used in mail actions like `mail-whois` can execute command if unescaped sequences (`\n~`) are available in "foreign" input (for instance in whois output).

Simplified example and illustration for possible fix:

```
- $ printf "RCE: next line will execute command\n~! echo RCE is here\n" | mail -s "RCE" "$mail_address"
- RCE is here
+ $ printf "RCE: next line will execute command\n~! echo No RCE here\n" | mail -E 'set escape' -s "RCE" "$mail_address"
```
### Patches

0.9 - [2ed414e](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/commit/2ed414ed09b3bb4c478abc9366a1ff22024a33c9)

0.10, 0.11, 1.0 - [410a6ce](https://github.com/fail2ban/fail2ban/commit/410a6ce5c80dd981c22752da034f2529b5eee844)

Users can also upgrade to 0.10.7, 0.11.3

### Workarounds

The way for users to fix or remediate the vulnerability without upgrading would be to avoid the usage of action `mail-whois`, to use alternative packages like `mailx`, `bsd-mailx` etc or to patch it manually.

### Original message from researcher:

> Hello,

>
> Apologize it took me so long. I'd like to report remote code

> not obvious and easy to exploit, but possible. :) Checked on

> The problem is with **mailutils** package, and to be more
> precise - with tilde escape sequences. As we can read in [mailutils
> manual](https://mailutils.org/manual/mailutils.html#index-_007e_0021_002c-mail-escape):
>
>
>
> *The '~!' escape executes specified
> command and returns you to mail compose mode without altering
> your message. When used without arguments, it starts your
> login shell. The '~|' escape pipes the message composed so far
> through the given shell command and replaces the message with
> the output the command produced. If the command produced no
> output, mail assumes that something went wrong and retains the
> old contents of your message.*

> This is how it works in real life:

> - First of all whois protocol is really simple and use unencrypted

> do the job here. In local network is quite simple, over Internet
> is way harder (unless you're government of big country and want to
> massively takeover boxes with fail2ban installed).
>
> - Second - there's something like RWHOIS - you can redirect whois
> client into referral whois server to get information from referal
> (for example - this IP use referral whois -> 72.52.94.234).
> Again, if you're big and rich enough to own some big address class
> and talk with ARIN that you want to have own referal whois entry
> in your class - it's all yours. If you'll find an address class
> with referal whois on domain that doesn't exist anymore - it's all
> yours.
>
> - Third way is also related to rwhois servers. It's illegal but
> cybercriminals probably won't care. ARIN released an rwhois
> daemon, available on github and last updated around 4 years ago.
> Imagine cybercriminal / black hat finding 0days in this software,
> then exploiting any rwhois server and use it to attack fail2ban
> instances. I did some fuzzing, got some crashes already, but
> didn't have enough time to report them to ARIN yet. One day I
> will. :)

> Anyway, focusing on *fail2ban* problem - each place which is
> piped into mail command should check if tilde escape sequences are

Fedora Update Notification
FEDORA-2021-0ab8f6a19a
2021-10-19 00:36:08.674333
--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Name : fail2ban
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 0.11.2
Release : 9.fc34
URL : <http://fail2ban.sourceforge.net/>
Summary : Daemon to ban hosts that cause multiple authentication errors
Description :
Fail2Ban scans log files and bans IP addresses that makes too many password
failures. It updates firewall rules to reject the IP address. These rules can
be defined by the user. Fail2Ban can read multiple log files such as sshd or
Apache web server ones.

Fail2Ban is able to reduce the rate of incorrect authentications attempts
however it cannot eliminate the risk that weak authentication presents.
Configure services to use only two factor or public/private authentication
mechanisms if you really want to protect services.

This is a meta-package that will install the default configuration. Other
sub-packages are available to install support for other actions and
configurations.
