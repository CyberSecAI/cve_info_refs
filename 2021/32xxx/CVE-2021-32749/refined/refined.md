Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `mail` command within the `mailutils` package interpreting tilde escape sequences (e.g., `~! command`) present in the input, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The core issue is the ability to inject arbitrary commands through specially crafted input to the `mail` command.
- **Unescaped Input:** The `mail` command, specifically when used with piped or redirected input, does not properly sanitize or escape tilde sequences, allowing them to be interpreted as commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the system running the vulnerable software with the privileges of the user executing `mail` command, which is often root in the context of fail2ban.
- **System Compromise:** RCE can lead to complete system compromise, data exfiltration, malware installation, and other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Mail Actions in Fail2ban:** The vulnerability is exposed when fail2ban's email actions (e.g. `mail-whois`, `mail`, `mail-buffered`) use the vulnerable `mail` command from `mailutils`. The `mail-whois` action is particularly vulnerable because it includes the output of the `whois` command in the email, which can be manipulated by an attacker.
- **Manipulated `whois` Output:** An attacker can control the output of the `whois` command by using a malicious `whois` server, or a Man-in-the-Middle (MITM) attack on the `whois` communication channel. By including a malicious tilde escape sequence in the output, the attacker can execute arbitrary commands when the email action is triggered.
- **Piped/Redirected Input:** The `mail` command is vulnerable when it receives input via pipes or redirection, as it does not sanitize the input.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Control over `whois` Output:** To exploit the `mail-whois` action, the attacker needs to control the output of the whois command for the target's IP address by redirecting the whois request to a malicious server.
- **Trigger a Fail2ban Action:** The attacker needs to trigger a ban action in fail2ban which uses a vulnerable mail action. This can be achieved by generating failed login attempts to the targeted service.
- **Network Position:** If the attacker is performing a MITM attack, they need to be positioned in the network path of the whois request.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by Jakub Å»oczek.
- Patches were released for multiple fail2ban versions (0.9, 0.10, 0.11 and 1.0).
- The vulnerability is fixed by using `mail -E 'set escape'` in mail actions, which disables the tilde escape sequences.
- The original fix with `-E` option was found to be incorrect and was later reverted.
- Users can mitigate the vulnerability by not using `mail-whois` action or using alternative mailers like `mailx`.
- Gentoo Security Advisory GLSA 202310-13 states that `net-mail/mailutils` versions `< 3.12-r3` are affected and that it is remotely exploitable.
