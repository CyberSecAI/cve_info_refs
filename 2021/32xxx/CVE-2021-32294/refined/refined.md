- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-buffer-overflow occurs in the `RIFF::List::GetSubList` function due to an out-of-bounds read.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-buffer-overflow. The `GetSubList` function attempts to read beyond the allocated buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The vulnerability leads to a crash due to an out-of-bounds memory access detected by AddressSanitizer. This could potentially lead to arbitrary code execution if exploited.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a crafted RIFF file. The specific file is attached to the issue as a zip file "heap-overflow-GetSubList-RIFF-1151.zip".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a maliciously crafted RIFF file to the affected application to trigger the vulnerability. The attacker needs to be able to trigger the `gigextract` tool to process the file.
