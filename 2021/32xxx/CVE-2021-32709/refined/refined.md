- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control. Specifically, the lack of ACL validation when creating order credits in the admin interface.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could potentially create unauthorized order credits.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited via the admin orders interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to have access to the admin panel.
