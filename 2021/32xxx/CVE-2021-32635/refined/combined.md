## Security Related Fixes

[CVE-2021-32635](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/security/advisories/GHSA-5mv9-q7fq-9394): Due to incorrect use of a default URL, singularity action commands (run/shell/exec) specifying a container using a library:// URI will always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint (cloud.sylabs.io) rather than the configured remote endpoint. An attacker may be able to push a malicious container to the default remote endpoint with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-default remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container.

Please see the published security advisory at github.com/sylabs/singularity/security/advisories for further detail.

# Singularity: Remote code execution — GLSA **202107-50**

A vulnerability in Singularity could result in remote code
execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **sys-cluster/singularity** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **3.7.4** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **3.7.4** |

### Background

Singularity is the container platform for performance sensitive
workloads.

### Description

Singularity always uses the default remote endpoint,
‘cloud.syslabs.io’, for action commands using the ‘library://’
URI rather than the configured remote endpoint.

### Impact

An attacker that that can push a malicious container to the default
remote endpoint could execute code on hosts that fetch the container.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Singularity users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=sys-cluster/singularity-3.7.4"

```
### References

# Action Commands (run/shell/exec) Against Library URIs Ignore Configured Remote Endpoint

Moderate

[tri-adam](/tri-adam)
published
GHSA-5mv9-q7fq-9394
May 26, 2021

## Package

Singularity

## Affected versions

3.7.2, 3.7.3

## Patched versions

3.7.4

## Description

### Impact

Due to incorrect use of a default URL, `singularity` action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) specifying a container using a `library://` URI will always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`) rather than the configured remote endpoint.

An attacker may be able to push a malicious container to the default remote endpoint with a URI that is identical to the URI used by a victim with a non-default remote endpoint, thus executing the malicious container.

Only action commands (`run`/`shell`/`exec`) against `library://` URIs are affected. Other commands such as `pull` / `push` respect the configured remote endpoint.

### Patches

All users should upgrade to Singularity 3.7.4 or later.

A patch was applied at: [d52ae9d](https://github.com/sylabs/singularity/commit/d52ae9d13979733c5e987a566fae59ed6f1bf796)

### Workarounds

Users who only interact with the default remote endpoint are not affected.

Installations with an execution control list configured to restrict execution to containers signed with specific secure keys are not affected.

### For more information

General questions about the impact of the advisory can be asked in the:

* [SingularityCE Slack Channel](https://singularityce.slack.com)
* [SingularityCE Mailing List](https://groups.google.com/g/singularity-ce)

Any sensitive security concerns should be directed to: security@sylabs.io

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
