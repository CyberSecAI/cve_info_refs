Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32635:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the incorrect use of a default URL when handling `library://` URIs in Singularity action commands (`run`, `shell`, `exec`). Specifically, these commands always attempt to retrieve the container from the default remote endpoint (`cloud.sylabs.io`), regardless of the configured remote endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Incorrect default URL usage:** Action commands for `library://` URIs do not use the configured remote endpoint, leading to predictable behavior of fetching from the default remote endpoint. This is a configuration issue that could have been avoided by respecting the user's configuration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can push a malicious container to the default remote endpoint, using a URI identical to one used by a victim with a non-default endpoint. When the victim attempts to execute the container using the vulnerable `singularity` command, the attacker's malicious container is executed instead.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network:** The attacker pushes a malicious container to the default remote endpoint, which is typically accessible over the network.
- **URI collision:** The attacker must use the same URI as a victim user to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Access to push to the default remote endpoint:** The attacker needs the ability to upload a container to the default container registry (`cloud.sylabs.io`).
- **Knowledge of target's container URI:** The attacker must know or guess a `library://` URI used by a victim who has a non-default endpoint configured, making this somewhat targeted.

**Additional notes:**
- The vulnerability only affects `run`, `shell`, and `exec` commands using `library://` URIs. The `pull` and `push` commands are unaffected.
- This vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 6.3.
- The issue was resolved in Singularity version 3.7.4, so upgrading to this version or higher is the recommended mitigation.
- Users who only interact with the default remote endpoint are not affected.
- Systems utilizing a secure execution control list that restricts execution to containers signed with specific keys are also not affected.
