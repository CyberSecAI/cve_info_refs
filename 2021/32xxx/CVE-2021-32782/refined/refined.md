Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32782:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input, specifically within the Nextcloud Circles application. The application does not escape HTML characters when displaying circle names in the UI.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability exists because user-controlled data (circle names) is displayed without proper encoding or escaping of HTML special characters.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within a circle's name.
- When other users view the circle name, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browser session, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies or perform other actions with the user's credentials.
- However, the impact is mitigated by the Content-Security-Policy (CSP) present in modern browsers.  Browsers without CSP are vulnerable.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker can create or modify a circle with a malicious name containing JavaScript code.
- This attack is possible for any user who can create or modify circles in the application.
- When other users view a list of circles, the injected code is executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be a user of the Nextcloud instance using the Circles application.
- The attacker must have the ability to create or modify circles.

**Additional Notes**
- The provided commit fixes the vulnerability by adding proper HTML escaping of the circle name before rendering to the page using the escapeHTML function, which replaces characters like `<`, `>`, `&`, `"`, and `'` with their respective HTML entities (`&lt;`, `&gt;`, `&amp;`, `&quot;`, `&#039;`).
- The vulnerability is considered "Low" severity due to the presence of CSP in most modern browsers, which prevents the execution of injected script.
- The advisory specifically mentions Internet Explorer as a browser without proper CSP support, making it vulnerable to this XSS.
