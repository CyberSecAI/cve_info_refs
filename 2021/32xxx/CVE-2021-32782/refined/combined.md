# XSS in Nextcloud Circles

Low

[LukasReschke](/LukasReschke)
published
GHSA-hgpq-28gj-jrj9
Sep 6, 2021

## Package

Nextcloud Circles

## Affected versions

< 0.21.3, < 0.20.10, < 0.19.14

## Patched versions

0.21.3, 0.20.10, 0.19.14

## Description

### Impact

The Nextcloud Circles application was vulnerable to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

Due the strict Content-Security-Policy shipped with Nextcloud, this issue is not exploitable on modern browsers supporting Content-Security-Policy.

### Patches

It is recommended that the Nextcloud Circles application is upgraded to 0.21.3, 0.20.10 or 0.19.14

### Workarounds

Use a browser that has support for Content-Security-Policy. You can find a list of supported browsers on [caniuse.com](https://caniuse.com/contentsecuritypolicy). A notable exemption is Internet Explorer which does not support CSP properly.
