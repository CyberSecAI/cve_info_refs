Multiple security issues were discovered in pjproject, is a free and
open source multimedia communication library.

    A race condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted
    socket having no group lock. Second, the SSL socket
    parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake. s. They cause
    crash, resulting in a denial of service.

CVE-2021-37706

    An incoming STUN message contains an ERROR-CODE attribute, the
    header length is not checked before performing a subtraction
    operation, potentially resulting in an integer underflow scenario.
    This issue affects all users that use STUN. A malicious actor
    located within the victim’s network may forge and send a specially
    crafted UDP (STUN) message that could remotely execute arbitrary
    code on the victim’s machine

CVE-2021-41141

    In various parts of PJSIP, when error/failure occurs, it is found
    that the function returns without releasing the currently held
    locks. This could result in a system deadlock, which cause a
    denial of service for the users.

CVE-2021-43299

    Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_player_create. An
    attacker-controlled 'filename' argument may cause a buffer
    overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without
    any size validation.

CVE-2021-43300

    Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_recorder_create. An
    attacker-controlled 'filename' argument may cause a buffer
    overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without
    any size validation.

CVE-2021-43301

    Stack overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_playlist_create. An
    attacker-controlled 'file_names' argument may cause a buffer
    overflow since it is copied to a fixed-size stack buffer without
    any size validation.

CVE-2021-43302

    Read out-of-bounds in PJSUA API when calling
    pjsua_recorder_create. An attacker-controlled 'filename' argument
    may cause an out-of-bounds read when the filename is shorter than
    4 characters.

CVE-2021-43303

    Buffer overflow in PJSUA API when calling pjsua_call_dump. An
    attacker-controlled 'buffer' argument may cause a buffer overflow,
    since supplying an output buffer smaller than 128 characters may
    overflow the output buffer, regardless of the 'maxlen' argument
    supplied

CVE-2021-43804

    An incoming RTCP BYE message contains a reason's length, this
    declared length is not checked against the actual received packet
    size, potentially resulting in an out-of-bound read access. A
    malicious actor can send a RTCP BYE message with an invalid reason
    length

CVE-2021-43845

    if incoming RTCP XR message contain block, the data field is not
    checked against the received packet size, potentially resulting in
    an out-of-bound read access

CVE-2022-21722

    it is possible that certain incoming RTP/RTCP packets can
    potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This issue affects
    all users that use PJMEDIA and accept incoming RTP/RTCP.

CVE-2022-21723

    Parsing an incoming SIP message that contains a malformed
    multipart can potentially cause out-of-bound read access. This
    issue affects all PJSIP users that accept SIP multipart.

CVE-2022-23608

    When in a dialog set (or forking) scenario, a hash key shared by
    multiple UAC dialogs can potentially be prematurely freed when one
    of the dialogs is destroyed . The issue may cause a dialog set to
    be registered in the hash table multiple times (with different
    hash keys) leading to undefined behavior such as dialog list
    collision which eventually leading to endless loop

CVE-2022-24754

    There is a stack-buffer overflow vulnerability which only impacts
    PJSIP users who accept hashed digest credentials (credentials with
    data_type `PJSIP_CRED_DATA_DIGEST`).

CVE-2022-24764

     A stack buffer overflow vulnerability that affects PJSUA2 users
     or users that call the API `pjmedia_sdp_print(),
     pjmedia_sdp_media_print()`

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
2.5.5~dfsg-6+deb9u3.

```
* - Avoid SSL socket parent/listener getting destroyed during handshake by increasing parent's reference count.
- Add missing SSL socket close when the newly accepted SSL socket is discarded in SIP TLS transport.

* - Fix silly mistake: accepted active socket created without group lock in SSL socket.
- Replace assertion with normal validation check of SSL socket instance in OpenSSL verification callback (verify_cb()) to avoid crash, e.g: if somehow race condition with SSL socket destroy happens or OpenSSL application data index somehow gets corrupted.
```

# PJSIP: Multiple Vulnerabilities — GLSA **202210-37**

Multiple vulnerabilities have been found in PJSIP, the worst of which could result in arbitrary code execution.

### Affected packages

| Package | **net-libs/pjproject** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.12.1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.12.1** |

### Background

PJSIP is a free and open source multimedia communication library written in C language implementing standard based protocols such as SIP, SDP, RTP, STUN, TURN, and ICE.

### Description

Multiple vulnerabilities have been discovered in PJSIP. Please review the CVE identifiers referenced below for details.

### Impact

Please review the referenced CVE identifiers for details.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All PJSIP users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=net-libs/pjproject-2.12.1"

```

### @nanangizz **[nanangizz](/nanangizz)** commented [May 25, 2021](#issue-900258287)

There were a couple reports about crash related to SSL socket. In the investigation, we found a silly bug in SSL socket server code: the configured group lock is not applied to underlying socket (active socket), so race condition may happen between callback and destroy.

Also, call stack in one report points to certificate verification callback (`verify_cb()` function), which may also be caused by above bug or something else (e.g: OpenSSL application data index acquired via `SSL_get_ex_new_index()` somehow gets corrupted), so this PR also address the issue by adding normal validation check of SSL socket instance (was only assertion).

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Race condition in SSL socket server

Moderate

[sauwming](/sauwming)
published
GHSA-cv8x-p47p-99wr
Jul 23, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

2.11 or lower

## Patched versions

2.11.1 or later

## Description

There are a couple of issues found in the SSL socket:

* A race condition between callback and destroy, due to the accepted socket having no group lock.
* SSL socket parent/listener may get destroyed during handshake.

### Impact

Both issues were reported to happen intermittently in heavy load TLS connections on the server. They cause a crash, resulting in a denial of service. Client apps are typically not affected unless they accept incoming TLS connections and anticipate many such connections.

### Patches

The patch is available in commit [d5f95aa](https://github.com/pjsip/pjproject/commit/d5f95aa066f878b0aef6a64e60b61e8626e664cd).
