Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32686:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Race condition:** A race condition exists in the PJSIP library's SSL socket server implementation. This occurs because a newly accepted socket lacks a group lock, leading to potential conflicts between callbacks and socket destruction.
*   **Premature Destruction:** The parent/listener SSL socket could be destroyed during the handshake process of a new connection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Missing group lock:** The newly accepted SSL socket does not inherit or create a group lock, leading to potential race conditions if the socket is accessed by multiple threads simultaneously or destroyed during a callback operation.
*   **Insufficient reference counting:** The parent SSL socket's reference count is not properly managed during the handshake process, allowing it to be destroyed prematurely.
*   **Assertion failure:** An assertion within the OpenSSL verification callback (`verify_cb()`) could lead to crashes if there's a race condition during socket destruction or corruption of OpenSSL application data index

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The race conditions and premature destruction can lead to crashes, effectively causing a denial of service.
*   The vulnerability is reported to occur intermittently under heavy load TLS connections on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered when accepting incoming TLS connections on a server.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited by initiating a high volume of TLS connections on a server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be in a position to establish TLS connections with a vulnerable server.
*   The attacker needs to be able to initiate a high volume of TLS connections to trigger the race condition.

**Additional Details:**

*   The issue was identified via crash reports related to SSL sockets.
*   The fix involves:
    *   Ensuring that newly accepted sockets are created with the same group lock as the listening socket.
    *   Increasing the reference count of the parent socket to prevent it from being destroyed during the handshake.
    *   Replacing the assertion with normal validation in the `verify_cb()` function.
*   The vulnerability affects PJSIP version 2.11 and lower, and is fixed in 2.11.1 and later.
* The fix is included in commit `d5f95aa`.
* The issue affects applications accepting incoming TLS connections, not client apps which only initiate connections.
