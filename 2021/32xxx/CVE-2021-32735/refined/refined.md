Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32735:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of dynamic data displayed in the Kirby Panel. Specifically, HTML was not being escaped in various components, allowing for the injection of malicious code. This included:
  - Placeholders within translated error and info messages.
  - Error messages displayed in dialogs and the `fields` section.
  - Data shown in users and settings views.
  - Default text in `files`, `pages`, `users`, `checkboxes`, `radio`, `tags`, and `multiselect` fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of HTML escaping in dynamic content displayed in the Panel.
- Usage of `ListItem` component without proper sanitization of user-controlled content.
- Inconsistent handling of HTML output within different components.
- Lack of escaping in `text`, `help`, and `info` properties in blueprints by default.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript code within a user's Panel session.
- Potential privilege escalation if an attacker gains access to an admin's Panel session.
- Ability to trigger requests to the Kirby API with the permissions of the victim.
- Other JavaScript-powered attacks depending on the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Injecting malicious HTML into fields and configuration text that's displayed in the Panel.
  - This could be done through page titles, filenames, usernames, or other data displayed in the Panel UI.
- Potential for external attackers through frontend forms (e.g. user registration, contact forms) if input sanitization is not properly implemented.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to have the ability to modify data that is displayed in the Kirby Panel or through a frontend form that populates the panel.
- For attacks within the Panel, the attacker must have access to a user session with some privileges.
- To escalate privileges, the attacker must gain access to an admin user's Panel session.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was reported by @hdodov
- The fix involves escaping dynamic data in multiple places
- Custom `text`, `help`, and `info` queries are not escaped by default in version 3.5.7
- The `Box` component now supports a text-only mode that can be enabled by setting the `html` prop to `false`
- The `Autocomplete` component now has support for HTML in the `text` property with a new `html` property
