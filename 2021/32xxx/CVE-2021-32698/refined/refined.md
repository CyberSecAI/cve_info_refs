Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32698:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the way eLabFTW generates PDF documents. The application allows users to include images in the content. During PDF generation, the application would fetch the images specified via `img src` attributes, including those pointing to external URLs. This behavior allowed an attacker to trigger HTTP GET requests from the server by specifying arbitrary URLs in `img src` attributes within the content intended for PDF generation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Blind Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** The core vulnerability is a blind SSRF, where the attacker can make the server perform GET requests to arbitrary URLs, but does not receive the response, making it "blind".
- **Lack of Input Validation/Sanitization:** The application failed to properly validate or sanitize the `src` attribute of `img` tags before using them in PDF generation, leading to the SSRF vulnerability.
- **Inconsistent Security Policies:** The Content Security Policy (CSP) enforced in the browser is not applied during PDF generation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can use the server to make arbitrary HTTP GET requests. Though this is a "blind" SSRF since the attacker does not receive the response content, it can be used for various attacks such as:
    - **Internal Network Scanning:** probing for services and hosts within the internal network
    - **Data Exfiltration:** attempting to access internal endpoints.
    - **Denial of Service:** potentially causing the targeted external server to be overloaded.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector involves crafting a malicious document intended for PDF generation, which includes `img` tags with `src` attributes pointing to attacker-controlled URLs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs the ability to input/control content that is processed by the PDF generation functionality.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by @mgrRaf and @xoffense.
- The fix implemented was a regular expression to remove any `img src` attributes that starts with `http` or `ftp` from the html content before PDF generation.
- The commit that addresses the vulnerability is [3d2db4d](https://github.com/elabftw/elabftw/commit/3d2db4d3ad90b0915f29f05aeba41eaaf6a7c726).
- The vulnerability is rated as **Low severity** due to PHP configuration measures in place that limit the possible escalations of this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is classified as CWE-918 (Server-Side Request Forgery).
