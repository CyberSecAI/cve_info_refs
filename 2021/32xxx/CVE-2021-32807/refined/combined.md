# Remote Code Execution via unsafe classes in otherwise permitted modules

## Package

pip

AccessControl
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

>=4.0, <4.3, <5.2

## Patched versions

4.3, 5.2

## Description

### Impact

The module `AccessControl` defines security policies for Python code used in restricted code within Zope applications. Restricted code is any code that resides in Zope's object database, such as the contents of `Script (Python)` objects.

The policies defined in `AccessControl` severely restrict access to Python modules and only exempt a few that are deemed safe, such as Python's `string` module. However, full access to the `string` module also allows access to the class `Formatter`, which can be overridden and extended within `Script (Python)` in a way that provides access to other unsafe Python libraries. Those unsafe Python libraries can be used for remote code execution.

By default, you need to have the admin-level Zope "Manager" role to add or edit `Script (Python)` objects through the web. Only sites that allow untrusted users to add/edit these scripts through the web - which would be a very unusual configuration to begin with - are at risk.

### Patches

The problem has been fixed in AccessControl 4.3 and 5.2.

Only AccessControl versions 4 and 5 are vulnerable, and only on Python 3, not Python 2.7.

### Workarounds

A site administrator can restrict adding/editing `Script (Python)` objects through the web using the standard Zope user/role permission mechanisms. Untrusted users should not be assigned the Zope Manager role and adding/editing these scripts through the web should be restricted to trusted users only. This is the default configuration in Zope.
