{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The ZStack REST API is vulnerable to unsafe deserialization due to the use of a custom deserializer that allows an attacker to control the class name and data during deserialization. The `RESTApiDecoder.loads` method uses GSON to deserialize the request body based on a provided class name from the request, without proper validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unsafe deserialization",
      "Lack of input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can potentially achieve Denial of Service (DoS) by closing file descriptors used by the process using a crafted payload, leading to a crash. With a suitable gadget, remote code execution (RCE) might also be possible.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the ZStack REST API endpoint (`/api`).",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the ZStack API and control the request body. No authentication is required."
