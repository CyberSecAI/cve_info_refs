{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The ContextListener in Symfony Security HTTP component incorrectly handled multiple firewalls, allowing an authenticated token from one firewall to be accessible to all other firewalls.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "An authenticated token from one firewall is made available to all other firewalls, even if they should have different providers."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could gain unauthorized access to different parts of the application by authenticating against one firewall and then using the same authenticated token in other parts of the application that should have different security configurations.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker could exploit this vulnerability by authenticating against one firewall and then accessing resources protected by other firewalls without providing the appropriate authentication.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to authenticate against at least one firewall in the application. The attacker needs to be able to make requests against other protected parts of the application.  A user with low privileges in one firewall could potentially have high privileges in another, making this vulnerability dangerous."
