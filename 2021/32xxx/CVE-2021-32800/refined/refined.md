Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-32800:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Nextcloud handles two-factor authentication (2FA). Specifically, it appears a check for the presence of a 2FA provider was missing, allowing a bypass of 2FA.

**Weakness:**
- **CWE-304:** Missing Critical Step in Authentication. The application failed to properly enforce 2FA, a critical step in the authentication process, as indicated by the CWE mapping.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypass of Two-Factor Authentication:** An attacker could bypass 2FA by exploiting the missing provider check. This means that having just a password or access to a WebAuthN trusted device was sufficient to gain unauthorized access to a user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely, without requiring physical access to the server.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The attacker is able to directly bypass the 2FA mechanism.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker needs to have knowledge of a user's password or have access to a WebAuthN trusted device associated with a user account. This suggests the attacker might be an insider or someone who has already compromised other credentials.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerability was addressed in Nextcloud versions 20.0.12, 21.0.4, and 22.1.0.
- A patch was implemented via a pull request ([https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/28078](https://github.com/nextcloud/server/pull/28078)) to check for missing providers.
- There were no known workarounds other than upgrading to a patched version.
