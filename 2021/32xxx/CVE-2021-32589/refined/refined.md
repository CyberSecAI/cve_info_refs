- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Use-After-Free (UAF) vulnerability in the `fgfmsd` daemon.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper memory management, specifically a use-after-free condition.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote, non-authenticated attacker can execute unauthorized code as root.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a specifically crafted request to the `fgfm` port of the targeted device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service on the target device and have knowledge of the specific crafting requirements to trigger the UAF condition. No authentication is needed.
