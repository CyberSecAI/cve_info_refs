{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The Express Handlebars library mixes template data with engine configuration options through the Express render API. Specifically, the `layout` parameter, when passed via user-controlled input (e.g., `req.query`), can be used to include arbitrary files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Mixing of template data and configuration options",
      "Improper handling of user-controlled input in template rendering",
        "Direct usage of `req.query` without sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "File disclosure. An attacker can potentially read sensitive files from the server's filesystem by manipulating the `layout` parameter.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP GET requests with a malicious `layout` parameter via `req.query`"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server with the ability to manipulate the query parameters.",
    "details": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that Express Handlebars allows configuration options, such as the path to the layout file, to be passed through the same object as template data. When user-controlled data (like `req.query`) is passed directly to `res.render`, an attacker can inject a malicious `layout` parameter to include arbitrary files from the server filesystem. This occurs because `express-handlebars` reads template data and configuration parameters (such as `layout`) from the same object provided to `res.render`. It does not properly sanitize or separate these parameters, making it possible to include arbitrary files from the server's file system via the `layout` parameter. An attacker could send a request to a vulnerable application, setting the `layout` parameter to a file path. This path will be used as the layout template, leading to the disclosure of the content of the specified file."
