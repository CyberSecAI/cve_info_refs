Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32701:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from an improper implementation of caching in the OAuth2 introspection authenticator. Once a token was cached, subsequent requests would bypass full claim validation, relying only on the expiration time of the cached token instead of re-validating scopes, issuers, and audiences.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient validation:** The cache mechanism did not validate token claims (scopes, issuers, audiences) on subsequent requests after the token was initially cached. It only checked the token's expiration time.
- **Bypass of authorization checks:** This vulnerability allowed a token that was initially valid for a specific scope, issuer, or audience to be used to access resources protected by different scopes, issuers, or audiences if the token was still within its cached time frame.
- **Missing test coverage:** The initial pull request introducing the caching mechanism did not have sufficient test coverage, which allowed the vulnerability to pass review.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authorization bypass:** An attacker could potentially bypass authorization checks, accessing resources they shouldn't have access to by reusing a cached token with different scopes, issuers, or audiences.
- **Privilege escalation:** By bypassing authorization, an attacker could potentially escalate their privileges within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves making an initial request with a valid token and scope, allowing it to be cached. Then, making subsequent requests with the same cached token but requesting resources that require a different scope, issuer, or audience.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a valid access token and make an initial request to have the token cached.
- The attacker must be able to make subsequent requests using the cached token within its cached lifespan.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was introduced in pull request #424.
- The fix involves modifying the tokenFromCache function to consider the scope strategy and adding tests to ensure proper caching behavior.
- The fix was released in version `v0.38.12-beta.1`.
- The caching mechanism is disabled by default in the `oauth2_introspection` authenticator and if caching is disabled the vulnerability is not exploitable.
- The vulnerability has been assigned CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).
- CodeQL scanning was added to the CI to prevent similar issues from arising in the future.
