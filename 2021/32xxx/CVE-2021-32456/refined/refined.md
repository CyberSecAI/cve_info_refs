Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32456:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of HTTP for the authentication process of legitimate users to the CAP/PRX web panel. This results in the transmission of access credentials in cleartext.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319). Specifically, user authentication credentials are sent over the network unencrypted.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can obtain user authentication passwords by analyzing network traffic.
- This would allow the attacker to gain unauthorized access to the CAP/PRX web panel.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker with access to the local network where the CAP/PRX device is located.
- An attacker who has access to the user's computer could also intercept the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have network access to the device or the user's computer.
- The attacker needs to be able to capture and analyze network traffic (e.g., through packet sniffing).

**Additional Information:**

- The affected product is the SITEL CAP/PRX device with firmware version 5.2.01.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3.1 base score of 6.5 with a vector string of AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N, indicating that the vulnerability can be exploited with adjacent network access, with low complexity and no privileges or user interaction to cause a high confidentiality impact.
- The fix for the vulnerability is available in version 1.2 of the CAP-PRX-NG platform.
- The vulnerability was initially disclosed by researchers on 11/08/2017, but the coordinated publication was on 13/05/2021.
