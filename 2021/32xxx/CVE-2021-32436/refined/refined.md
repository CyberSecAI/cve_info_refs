Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-32436:

**Root Cause:**
- Out-of-bounds read in the `write_title()` function within the `subs.c` file. Specifically, the code accesses `&s->text[2]` without properly validating if the index 2 is within the bounds of `s->text`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Out-of-Bounds Read:** The program attempts to read memory outside the allocated buffer for `s->text`. This occurs when a crafted input file causes the `write_title` function to be called with a `SYMBOL` struct `s` that contains a `text` field with less than 2 bytes allocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the application to crash due to a segmentation fault (SIGSEGV) by providing a specially crafted ABC file that triggers the out-of-bounds read. This makes the program unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted ABC file:** An attacker must provide a malicious ABC file as input to the `abcm2ps` program. This file needs to be crafted in such a way that when the parser reaches a title directive ('T:'), the resulting symbol struct `s` has a text field that doesn't have the correct size and allows the `&s->text[2]` read to go out of bounds.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious input file to the abcm2ps program.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is triggered in the `write_title()` function which is called from `write_heading()` and `get_info()`.
- The root cause was linked to a related bug in voice overlay duration processing that could corrupt symbol data.
- A fix was implemented in commit `2f56e1179cab6affeb8afa9d6c324008fe40d8e3`, which addressed the voice overlay duration issue, and indirectly fixed the out-of-bounds read.
