The provided content is related to CVE-2021-32834.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure handling of Groovy scripts within the Eclipse Keti Policy Set validation process. Specifically, user-provided Groovy expressions in policy conditions are parsed and executed without proper sanitization, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1. **Arbitrary Groovy Script Evaluation:** Policy conditions are parsed as Groovy scripts, enabling injection of malicious code.
2. **Groovy Sandbox Escape:** The provided sandbox is bypassed through Groovy meta-programming using the `@ASTTest` annotation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation leads to post-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**
An attacker with the ability to create Policy Sets can inject malicious Groovy scripts into the conditions of a policy.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be a user who is authorized to create or modify Policy Sets within Eclipse Keti. This requires a valid authentication token.
