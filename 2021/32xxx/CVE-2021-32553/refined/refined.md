The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the `apport` package. This response will focus specifically on CVE-2021-32553.

**CVE-2021-32553**: This CVE relates to an arbitrary file read vulnerability within the `add_info()` function in the `package-hooks/source_openjdk-*.py` scripts of the `apport` package.

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `add_info()` function constructs a file path using user-controlled data from the `ProcCwd` and `Pid` fields of a crash report without proper sanitization. Specifically, it concatenates the `ProcCwd` value with a fixed string and the `Pid`, potentially allowing for directory traversal if the `ProcCwd` contains relative paths or directory traversal sequences like "..".
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a path traversal issue, where an attacker can control parts of a file path used by the application to read files. This bypasses intended access restrictions by allowing the reading of files outside the intended directory.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the system, potentially leading to the disclosure of sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious crash report file. This crash report contains a `ProcCwd` field that can be manipulated to include directory traversal sequences and a `Pid` to control the final part of the path to the file being read.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to create a crash report file on the system.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to trigger the apport mechanism (e.g. by causing an application crash or manually triggering `whoopsie-upload-all`).
    *   The attacker does not need to be root but needs to be able to write to the /var/crash directory.
    *   By crafting the contents of the crash file, the attacker can control the `ProcCwd` and `Pid` fields which are used to construct the path to the file which will be read.
