Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32771:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is located in the RPL-Classic implementation in Contiki-NG, specifically in `os/net/routing/rpl-classic/rpl-icmp6.c`.
- The code processes RPL Target options within DAO messages without properly validating the prefix length and buffer boundaries.
- The `prefixlen` variable is taken directly from the received packet without validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Insufficient input validation:** The code fails to validate that `prefixlen` is within the valid range for an IPv6 prefix (0-128 bits).
2.  **Missing boundary check:** The code does not check if there are enough bytes available in the packet to copy `(prefixlen + 7) / CHAR_BIT` bytes, leading to an out-of-bounds read.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A buffer overflow can be triggered if an attacker sends a crafted DAO message with an invalid prefix length in the Target option. This can lead to a denial of service and potentially arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the reception of a crafted DAO (Destination Advertisement Object) packet containing a malicious RPL Target option.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send packets to a Contiki-NG system that has joined an RPL DODAG.
- The attacker must be able to craft a DAO packet with a target option that contains a prefix length greater than 128 bits.
- It is also noted that a read out of bounds can be triggered by sending a prefix length that would cause a read past the end of the provided packet data.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in Contiki-NG versions up to and including 4.7.
- The fix for the vulnerability is in [Contiki-NG PR #1615](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1615) which added checks for the prefix length and available bytes before copying the prefix.
- The vulnerability is classified as High severity with CWE-121 (Stack-based Buffer Overflow) and CWE-126 (Buffer Over-read)
