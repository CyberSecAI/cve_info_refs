# Press release

We are releasing version 4.8 of Contiki-NG. This release adds 64-bit support and performance improvements for Cooja, several security-related fixes, upgraded scripts to python3, and many bug fixes and improvements. The documentation wiki is now moved to read-the-docs for improved readability and maintenance.

Various parts of the user experience for developers have been improved in this release:

* The Contiki-NG build system has been updated with support for ccache ([#1789](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1789)) and improved error checking and reporting.
* Docker image updated to 64-bit Ubuntu 20.04 and toolchains in the image upgraded to versions with better error detection.
* Cooja has been updated with improved error checking and reporting

Overall, this will allow the developer to find and eliminate more errors before even starting the application.

* GitHub repository: <https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng>
* Documentation: <https://contiki-ng.readthedocs.io/en/master>

## API changes for ports outside the main tree

* `Makefile.customrules-$(TARGET)` is no longer included by default, the name of the makefile has to be added to `MAKEFILES_CUSTOMRULES` by some makefile used by the target. Link to [example](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1908) of in-tree CPU using the API.

# Buffer overflow caused by incorrect RPL DAO prefix lengths

High

[joakimeriksson](/joakimeriksson)
published
GHSA-jqjf-v7v9-xp6w
Aug 4, 2022

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

<= 4.7

## Patched versions

None

## Description

### Impact

It is possible to cause a buffer overflow when copying an IPv6 address prefix in the RPL-Classic implementation in Contiki-NG. In order to trigger the vulnerability, the Contiki-NG system must have joined an RPL DODAG. After that, an attacker can send a DAO packet with a Target option that contains a prefix length larger than 128 bits. The code fragment below shows the vulnerability, which resides in the module os/net/routing/rpl-classic/rpl-icmp6.c:

```
switch(subopt_type) {
case RPL_OPTION_TARGET:
  prefixlen = buffer[i + 3];
  memset(&prefix, 0, sizeof(prefix));
  memcpy(&prefix, buffer + i + 4, (prefixlen + 7) / CHAR_BIT);
  break;

```

Here, the prefixlen variable is taken without validation from the packet supplied by the potential attacker. Additionally, the memory copy does not verify that there are enough bytes available in the packet to copy `(prefixlen + 7) / CHAR_BIT` bytes, which can thus trigger a read out of bounds as well.

### Patches

The problem was fixed after the release of Contiki-NG 4.7. Before the next version is released, users can apply the workaround below.

### Workarounds

Users can apply the patch in [Contiki-NG PR #1615](https://github.com/contiki-ng/contiki-ng/pull/1615).

### @nvt **[nvt](/nvt)** commented [Jul 9, 2021](#issue-940943215)

RPL-Classic accepts RPL Target options in DAO messages with invalid prefix lengths. Additionally, it does not check whether there are enough bytes in the packets to copy a prefix of this length. This PR adds checks for these conditions so that the DAO message can be discarded.

Sorry, something went wrong.
