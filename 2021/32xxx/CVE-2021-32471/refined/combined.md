> Abstract:The universal Turing machine is generally considered to be the simplest, most abstract model of a computer. This paper reports on the discovery of an accidental arbitrary code execution vulnerability in Marvin Minsky's 1967 implementation of the universal Turing machine. By submitting crafted data, the machine may be coerced into executing user-provided code. The article presents the discovered vulnerability in detail and discusses its potential implications. To the best of our knowledge, an arbitrary code execution vulnerability has not previously been reported for such a simple system.

# Arbitrary Code Execution in the Universal Turing Machine

This is an implementation of the Universal Turing Machine as presented in Minsky, Computation: Finite and infinite machines, 1967, Chapter 7.

The default input to the simulated machine is an exploit that achieves arbitrary code execution.

Run the program with

```
$ python3.7 minskys_turing_machine.py

The vulnerability has been assigned [CVE-2021-32471](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32471) and is presented in detail in [Pontus Johnson](https://www.kth.se/profile/pontusj)'s paper [Intrinsic Propensity for Vulnerability in Computers? Arbitrary Code Execution in the Universal Turing Machine](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02124) from 2021. There is also [a talk on YouTube](https://youtu.be/pujUhiX9Mvk) on the vulnerability and its exploitation.

A visual simulation of the exploit is available at <https://intrinsic-propensity.github.io>.

For an alternative re-implementation of the vulnerable Minsky Turing machine, check out [Andreas Rozek's specification](https://github.com/rozek/Universal-Turing-Machine) for [Martín Ugarte's Turing machine simulator](https://turingmachinesimulator.com).

## About me

Pontus Johnson is a professor at the [KTH Royal Institute of Technology](http://www.kth.se/) in Stockholm, Sweden. His research interests mainly lie in the area of cyber security and the analysis of architectural models of computer networks – in particular simulating cyber attacks on such networks. Pontus supervises a number of PhD students and holds courses in [Ethical hacking](https://www.kth.se/nse/ethical).

He is the director of the [Center for Cyber Defense and Information Security](https://www.kth.se/cdis/center-for-cyber-defense-and-information-security-1.946294) at KTH, a collaboration with the Swedish Armed Forces, the National Defence Radio Establishment (FRA), the Swedish Civil Contingencies Agency (MSB), The Swedish Defence Research Agency (FOI) and the Swedish Defense University (FHS).

He is also the vice director of the national initiative [Cybercampus Sweden](https://cybercampus.se), inaugurated February of 2024.

He received his MSc from the Lund Institute of Technology in 1997 and his PhD and Docent titles from the Royal Institute of Technology in 2002 and 2007. He was appointed professor in 2009.

Since 2013, Pontus is a member of the [Swedish Royal Academy of Engineering Sciences (IVA)](http://www.iva.se). From 2024, he is serving on the IVA board as deputy chair. He has previously participated in various IVA projects – most notably the [project on Cybersecurity and Competitiveness](https://www.iva.se/det-iva-gor/projekt-och-program/cybersakerhet-for-okad-konkurrenskraft/) – chaired IVA's Division II, been a member of the medal committee, among other things.

From 2025, Pontus serves on the board of the [Swedish Research Council](https://www.vr.se/english.html).

He was a co-founder of Foreseeti, a research spin-off company developing cyber security attack simulation software, subsequently acquired by Google. Since 2023, Google offers [Attack Path Simulations](https://cloud.google.com/blog/products/identity-security/security-command-center-adds-attack-path-simulation-to-stay-ahead-of-cyber-risks) to its Cloud customers based on the technology developed by Pontus and his research colleagues.

In 2021, Pontus was credited with the [discovery](https://youtu.be/pujUhiX9Mvk) of the worlds oldest  [security vulnerability](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32471), [in the universal Turing machine](https://www.theregister.com/2021/05/11/turing_machine_0day_no_patch_available/). In 2022 as well as 2023, Tech Awards Sweden listed him among the [50 most influential people in Swedish tech](https://techawards.se/tech50/).

He has chaired, co-chaired, and participated as steering committee member in many international conferences and workshops and participated in program committees in over fifty such events. He has authored well over 100 scientific articles, mainly on the assessment and prediction of cyber security and other non-functional properties in software and computer networks.

Pontus spends 20% of his work time at Google. In the remaining 80%, he is a member of the [Software Systems Architecture and Security (SSAS) research group](https://www.kth.se/cs/nse/research/software-systems-architecture-and-security/software-systems-architecture-and-security-1.725322) within the [Division of Network and Systems Engineering](https://kth.se/nse) (NSE) at the Department of Computer Science in the [School of Electrical Engineering and Computer Science](https://kth.se/eecs/) (EECS) at KTH.

[00:04] the universal turing machine is a
[00:06] fundamental theoretical model of
[00:08] computation some would call it the
[00:10] mother of all computers and i represent
[00:13] the exploitation of the vulnerability
[00:15] that i've discovered
[00:16] in marvin minsky's 1967 implementation
[00:21] of the universal turing machine as an
[00:22] introduction to the actual exploit i'll
[00:24] review how
[00:25] these universal turing machines work and
[00:27] then i'm also to conclude by some
[00:30] general speculations about whether this
[00:32] might say something about
[00:33] computer security in general
[00:38] welcome to talk dot cyber cnn
[00:44] [Music]
[00:59] welcome to talk cyber cnn today
[01:03] from paris and uh we had a little bit
[01:06] technical problems with the setup here
[01:08] also the linkedin is not working today
[01:10] so uh
[01:11] sorry for that but in any case we are
[01:14] very happy to be live talks everything i
[01:17] uh the
[01:18] monthly speaker series today with this
[01:20] special edition
[01:22] with pontus johnson and as usual
[01:25] we have for the questions the
[01:28] schleido and uh therefore alexander
[01:32] over to you so that you can briefly
[01:34] explain how this video is
[01:36] working okay thank you michael even i
[01:38] thank you everyone for attending this
[01:40] presentation
[01:41] you will be able to ask questions on the
[01:44] youtube chat
[01:45] of course but you also have access to a
[01:47] tool called slido
[01:49] and the link is provided in the chat
[01:51] with this tool you will be able to ask
[01:53] questions
[01:54] and after the presentation maybe to
[01:56] answer a small word cloud
[01:58] so thanks everyone for attending again
[02:00] this presentation back to you mark
[02:02] oliver
[02:06] yeah so yeah thanks thanks a lot for the
[02:08] intro so the
[02:09] uh reason for the special edition is
[02:12] that we're very happy to have today
[02:13] pontius johnson you might have read
[02:16] about him
[02:17] because he created a wonderful paper
[02:19] about
[02:20] security risk or a security
[02:23] vulnerability that he found in the
[02:26] universal touring machine from marin
[02:28] minsky as you heard in the introduction
[02:30] and
[02:31] to give you a little bit backstory i was
[02:33] getting in contact with him and
[02:35] discussing the idea of maybe presenting
[02:37] that and i'm super happy that
[02:39] he agreed and that we have him today to
[02:42] present us what he found which i
[02:45] personally find super remarkable and
[02:47] super interesting because
[02:49] i cannot think of a better way of
[02:51] understanding our buffer overflow works
[02:53] than the work of pontus and yeah so i'm
[02:57] very happy he's here with us today
[03:00] so a response so bonus johnson is a
[03:02] professor at the kdh
[03:04] royal institute of technology in
[03:06] stockholm sweden his research interests
[03:08] mainly lie in the area of cyber security
[03:10] and the analysis
[03:11] of architectural models of computer
[03:14] networks
[03:15] in particular he's working on
[03:16] stimulating cyber attacks
[03:18] on such networks qantas supervises
[03:21] a number of phd students that holds
[03:24] courses in
[03:25] elected and ethical hacking he's the
[03:27] director of the center for
[03:29] cyber defense and information security
[03:31] at kth which is a collaboration with the
[03:33] swedish armed forces
[03:36] and on the website you'll find some more
[03:39] details about his cv
[03:40] and i can already say that also in the
[03:44] future
[03:44] maybe there's another opportunity to
[03:46] exchange with him because
[03:47] he's the perfect candidate for our
[03:50] series
[03:51] so without further ado uh pontos i hand
[03:54] over to you
[03:54] and we are all very much looking forward
[03:57] to
[03:58] your talk well thank you mark oliver
[04:02] and um thanks a lot for that very kind
[04:04] introduction
[04:06] um yes uh so so
[04:09] um i'll be talking today about this uh
[04:12] this about hacking the universal turing
[04:14] machine and that's really not the the
[04:17] main
[04:17] focus of my research or my
[04:20] uh my academic activities
[04:24] it was a a kind of hobby project that i
[04:28] spent some time on uh quite some while
[04:30] ago
[04:32] what that happened was that i i thought
[04:35] that because i thought i found a
[04:37] vulnerability in the
[04:38] in this journey i thought well i might
[04:40] as well get it registered
[04:41] in the uh international database for
[04:44] vulnerabilities so
[04:46] i submit that you can do that in five
[04:47] minutes if you think you found a
[04:48] vulnerability i submitted it to
[04:50] a database that's called the nvd it's
[04:53] the national vulnerability database it's
[04:55] america but it's really international
[04:57] and it was accepted and when it was
[04:59] accepted there
[05:02] all the vulnerabilities that they accept
[05:04] they are
[05:06] disseminated through a twitter feed and
[05:08] people are looking through that
[05:10] at that twitter feed for serious and
[05:12] interesting obviously
[05:13] vulnerabilities so this was picked up in
[05:17] in the news media and so so the the talk
[05:20] here
[05:20] uh that i'm giving i have this title
[05:23] mutter ale
[05:24] sigerheitzlien arbitrary code execution
[05:27] in the universal turing machine and this
[05:28] german one is
[05:30] from the article that you can see here
[05:31] in haisa i thought there was such a
[05:34] funny title so i thought i just had to
[05:36] reuse it
[05:38] so what i want to do today is i want to
[05:40] talk a bit about
[05:42] um well first arbitrary code execution
[05:46] what that is and then i'd like to talk
[05:48] about
[05:49] um the the universal turing machine
[05:53] uh where it comes from and and and then
[05:56] um
[05:57] what what it can be used for and then i
[06:00] want to go into details
[06:01] and there will be a quite detailed
[06:03] section on a
[06:04] universe specific universal touring
[06:06] machine that marvin minsky
[06:08] implementation and how it works
[06:10] and then how also it can be how it can
[06:12] be hacked
[06:13] uh to achieve arbitrary code execution
[06:15] and what it means
[06:16] really to to do that and then after
[06:20] that after being down in the wedge for a
[06:23] while
[06:23] uh i hope we can uh abstract
[06:26] um take a step back and consider whether
[06:30] uh there are any implications of this
[06:33] that that
[06:34] matter and what those would be in that
[06:36] case
[06:38] all right so let's start with
[06:41] arbitrary code execution so
[06:45] um so you can see elon musk here
[06:48] he says that um engineering is the
[06:51] closest thing to magic that exists in
[06:53] the world i think that arbitrary code
[06:55] execution is the closest thing to magic
[06:58] that exists in the world
[06:59] there's something really remarkable
[07:00] about this about this thing
[07:03] that you can buy some magic incantation
[07:07] some specific string that you provide
[07:10] you can
[07:12] execute your own code in a system where
[07:14] that was not at all intended
[07:16] you can become a a local god in that
[07:18] system
[07:19] uh you you gain enormous powers and so
[07:22] for me it seems like arbitrary code
[07:24] execution is really the pinnacle of
[07:26] hacking
[07:27] it's the finest thing that you can do
[07:29] and it's also a very
[07:31] remarkable and strange thing that this
[07:33] actually happens
[07:35] that it's possible to do this um so
[07:39] so i just want to put this start with
[07:41] this that arbitrary code execution it's
[07:43] it's
[07:44] a particular kind of hacking and it's a
[07:46] it's really i think
[07:48] that the most most magical of ways
[07:52] it's also remarkable that arbitrary code
[07:54] execution is uh
[07:56] prevalent is a list of the
[07:59] this is the common weakness enumeration
[08:02] it's a list of the top
[08:03] 25 most dangerous software errors and
[08:06] half of them
[08:07] can lead to arbitrary code execution so
[08:10] it's not a
[08:10] fringe phenomenon it's something that
[08:14] really
[08:15] that we really have to take seriously in
[08:18] in cyber security
[08:22] here is an example of how arbitrary code
[08:26] execution can happen this is sql
[08:28] injection
[08:28] sql it's a structured query language
[08:31] that's how you talk to some databases
[08:33] if you take a look at the logon screen
[08:36] in a web form for instance to the
[08:38] right here in the screen there's a field
[08:41] called user id and then there's a
[08:42] password
[08:44] for simplicity in this case the user id
[08:46] will be a number
[08:48] now that user id the text string that's
[08:51] written there
[08:53] it's written as a text string it will be
[08:56] translated in the
[08:57] program that receives the input from the
[08:59] logon screen
[09:00] into the text user id here and then the
[09:03] text user id
[09:05] in this web system will be appended to
[09:08] an sql statement which looks like this
[09:11] and an sql statement is a string
[09:13] and this string will be submitted to the
[09:15] database and
[09:16] the database of the database management
[09:18] system will then interpret this and
[09:20] execute this
[09:21] so uh here it says select star which
[09:25] means everything
[09:26] from the table that's called users in
[09:28] the database
[09:29] where the user id equals and if your
[09:31] user id is 105 and that's what you wrote
[09:34] then what you're going to get back here
[09:36] in text sql is
[09:37] ever all the the whole entry for your
[09:40] user the 105 and then you can check with
[09:42] the passwords and so on
[09:44] that they match now a hacker what a
[09:46] hacker can do here
[09:47] is to not provide just 105 but provide
[09:51] 105
[09:52] semicolon drop table users and the
[09:55] result
[09:55] would be this sql statement which is the
[09:58] same
[09:58] select everything from the table users
[10:01] where user id
[10:02] equals 105 just like it should be but
[10:04] then comes this semicolon
[10:06] it shouldn't be there really but the
[10:07] hacker added it and then there's a new
[10:09] line which says drop table users which
[10:12] means that you can then
[10:13] well that the sql database will
[10:17] interpret this and we'll delete that
[10:20] table and so
[10:21] this way the attacker would have deleted
[10:23] the whole user part of the database
[10:25] which of course is very
[10:27] unfortunate for the for the for the
[10:29] legitimate users of the system
[10:31] this is a standard example of arbitrary
[10:34] code execution
[10:36] we'll keep this in the back of our minds
[10:38] now for uh
[10:39] now we we move to a um
[10:42] a different subject first of all before
[10:44] we do that
[10:46] the problem here the problem with this
[10:50] program is that there is no imp there's
[10:52] no input validation
[10:54] so this is a weakness this is a common
[10:56] weakness
[10:58] that you don't validate the input you
[10:59] shouldn't allow the semicolon for
[11:01] instance
[11:02] uh you probably shouldn't allow anything
[11:04] but numbers here
[11:05] so that you allow the string to be
[11:07] appended to this string
[11:09] that's the problem um and so
[11:12] in proper input validation that is a
[11:14] vulnerability
[11:15] that is particularly relevant also in
[11:19] the rest of this talk
[11:21] now to something completely different
[11:23] the end children's problem
[11:25] so for the computer scientists out there
[11:28] the and children's problem actually the
[11:31] mathematicians also
[11:32] it's uh it was in the early
[11:36] 20th century there was great hope that
[11:39] there would be
[11:40] a solid foundation for mathematics and
[11:42] david hilbert was the
[11:44] great proponent of that
[11:47] that strive that ambition to create this
[11:50] solid foundation he postulated a number
[11:52] of problems that were questions that had
[11:54] to be answered and
[11:55] and he was certain that they would be
[11:56] answered positively and one of those
[11:59] was this inching problem which is the
[12:01] decision problem
[12:03] and as you can see here it is it's a bit
[12:05] convoluted is there an algorithm that
[12:07] would make a formal language and a
[12:08] logical statement in that language and
[12:10] will output true or false depending on
[12:12] the truth
[12:13] value of the statement more or less is
[12:15] there an algorithm that can
[12:17] in any relevant say formalism that we
[12:20] are that we're concerned with
[12:22] that can tell whether a statement is
[12:24] true or false is it possible to say
[12:26] whether
[12:26] a statement is true or false is that
[12:29] always possible
[12:31] so that's the uh the and china's problem
[12:35] um after some years there was a paper
[12:39] by uh the great alan turing
[12:43] um this paper on computable numbers
[12:46] with an application to the enchantments
[12:48] problem he addressed this problem
[12:50] um he realized that he could create
[12:54] a problem which reduces to the the
[12:57] the end chinese problem he called it the
[12:59] halting problem it's called the halting
[13:01] problem
[13:02] and it goes like this from a description
[13:04] of an arbitrary computer program
[13:06] and an input determine whether the
[13:08] program will finish running or continue
[13:10] to run forever
[13:12] if it's possible to decide to to create
[13:15] an algorithm to do this
[13:16] well then it's possible to solve the
[13:18] insider's problem but
[13:19] touring in this paper he demonstrates
[13:22] that it is not possible
[13:24] so that was a great discovery and that
[13:27] put one more nail actually in the coffin
[13:30] of
[13:30] of a solid foundation for mathematics
[13:33] but
[13:34] while in the process of solving this or
[13:38] answering this in chinese problem and
[13:41] entering needed as you can see here from
[13:42] the description of an arbitrary computer
[13:44] and in 1936 there were not many
[13:46] computers around so he needed a computer
[13:48] so he created one and that's the turing
[13:50] machine and actually the universal
[13:52] turing machine so
[13:53] it's kind of a byproduct in this paper
[13:56] to the ambition of addressing the
[13:58] the and children's problem um
[14:03] the turing machine we'll talk more about
[14:06] exactly how that works
[14:08] but uh we can say that
[14:11] it was used for this insider's problem
[14:13] but it's also
[14:14] become very used in many other
[14:17] fields so i went to google scholar i
[14:21] checked this paper from 1936 and then i
[14:24] clicked on who cites this paper and
[14:27] here's the list of
[14:28] the most cited papers that cite this
[14:31] paper
[14:32] and at the top you have alan turing
[14:34] himself with another paper but then we
[14:36] have papers on
[14:37] uh deep neural networks on quantum
[14:41] cryptography
[14:42] on economics on
[14:46] psychology on on the future
[14:51] there's this famous book by ray kurzweil
[14:53] the singularity is near
[14:54] and there's on complex systems
[14:56] algorithmic information theory and
[14:58] quantum theory and
[14:59] all kinds of theories it turns out that
[15:01] this turing machine
[15:03] is very very simple the simplest of all
[15:06] actually
[15:07] models of a computer that is very useful
[15:11] we have at the at the uh one of
[15:15] the final one here is the marvin minsky
[15:18] book computation we'll get back to that
[15:21] that's the
[15:21] implementation of the universal turing
[15:23] machine that we will be addressing
[15:25] and you're stephen wolfram also he's
[15:27] also interested in
[15:28] in touring machines we'll get back a
[15:31] little bit to him also
[15:34] so these are legitimate uses of the
[15:36] turing machine
[15:37] there are less obvious things that
[15:39] people do with the turing machine
[15:41] um one thing that you can do which
[15:43] claude shannon spent some time working
[15:45] on is to try to devise the smallest
[15:47] turing machine possible
[15:48] and the turing machine decides the size
[15:51] of a
[15:52] universal turing machine should be is is
[15:55] uh
[15:56] um determined in its
[15:59] the number of states and its uh alphabet
[16:02] and uh there are really small universal
[16:04] turing machines
[16:06] there's a problem called the busy beaver
[16:08] problem which people
[16:09] uh which runs on a turing machine it's a
[16:11] really really complicated problem with
[16:13] uh
[16:13] with implications for complexity theory
[16:16] but there's also just a
[16:18] record in trying to find the uh
[16:21] most the the uh most successful busy
[16:24] beaver
[16:24] uh in a turing machine of a certain size
[16:28] you can do self-replicating terms turing
[16:30] machines and you can build turing
[16:31] machines in lego and you can build
[16:33] turing machines in
[16:34] wood and you can build turing machines
[16:37] in minecraft also
[16:38] you can have a turing machine tattoo as
[16:41] you can see here
[16:43] you can do drawings with turing machines
[16:46] which is this
[16:46] gray black thing in the corner and i
[16:50] thought i'd
[16:50] show also another thing that you can do
[16:53] um
[16:54] so the call of it is actually that you
[16:56] have
[16:57] this tape in the middle and this is
[17:00] an infinitely long tape and it could be
[17:03] infinitely long
[17:04] in both directions so this could
[17:06] actually be made of chocolate
[17:08] and i did come with stuff to make
[17:11] it out of chocolate but the chocolate
[17:13] that i could get hold of the actual
[17:14] squares were a little do
[17:16] too small so if you get large bars of
[17:18] chocolate that are even larger than this
[17:21] then you could actually make the whole
[17:22] thing out of chocolate i hope this looks
[17:24] a bit like
[17:25] a strip of chocolate though
[17:29] the first problem you encounter is this
[17:32] tape does have to be infinitely long
[17:36] right so you can create a turing machine
[17:39] out of chocolate also
[17:42] so yet one thing that you can try to do
[17:46] with turing machine is to
[17:47] hack it uh in particular than uh a
[17:50] universal turing machine but why would
[17:52] you want to do that
[17:54] um and for me the reason why i
[17:57] uh why i um
[18:00] why i went out on this hobby project
[18:04] i started it was because i've been
[18:06] thinking a little bit about
[18:08] the root of cyber security and
[18:11] insecurity why is it that computers so
[18:14] often are insecure
[18:15] it's a huge societal problem and it
[18:17] seems to me that it's not clear
[18:19] why why this is the case why does it
[18:21] seem so very difficult to solve this
[18:23] problem
[18:24] why can't we build secure systems
[18:28] so one way to address a problem is to
[18:31] try to solve it in the simplest form
[18:34] that you can
[18:36] and then you have to pose it in the
[18:38] simplest possible form and that's really
[18:40] what this
[18:41] this project was about what is the
[18:43] simplest way to
[18:45] understand what insecurity and hacking
[18:48] is and that would be i think to hack a
[18:51] universal turing machine the simplest
[18:53] kind of computer possible
[18:58] all right so that's the background to
[19:02] why this might be interesting
[19:05] and and what the turing machine where
[19:07] the turing machine
[19:08] comes from and then also this this issue
[19:11] of arbitrary code execution
[19:13] now we're going to get into the weeds of
[19:15] how turing machines work
[19:17] and this is here a a diagram of a turing
[19:20] machine and so you can say
[19:21] that there is first there is an infinite
[19:24] tape
[19:24] with that is divided into squares
[19:28] and then there's a head this is the m
[19:31] thing here or the
[19:32] the the top part of the m which can
[19:35] read the square that is positioned above
[19:39] and it can write something to that and
[19:41] then you can move one step to the left
[19:44] or one step to the right that's a
[19:46] touring mission
[19:47] a tape and a head you can read you can
[19:50] write
[19:51] you can take a step to the left or a
[19:52] step to the right
[19:54] and then there are many different turing
[19:55] machines and the different kinds of
[19:57] turing machines they're determined by
[19:59] how when you decide to move left and
[20:01] right and what you decide to read or
[20:02] write
[20:03] should also mention that you can have
[20:04] any symbols in each square you can have
[20:06] ones or zeros and zeros or you can have
[20:09] a's and b's and whatever symbols you
[20:11] want
[20:13] how this head moves about is determined
[20:16] by a state machine
[20:18] here we have a state machine for
[20:19] instance for a binary counter
[20:22] this state machine will count uh a
[20:25] binary number and will increase it by
[20:27] one
[20:27] um and and continue to do so until
[20:31] until the infinity or until the tape
[20:34] and so the impotence uh
[20:37] we will take a look at how this works
[20:39] and what what the
[20:40] how this state machine uh functions uh
[20:43] here so
[20:47] you see the tape on the tape we now have
[20:50] four numbers they are the input to the
[20:52] tape so this is the input
[20:54] to the turing machine that is this
[20:56] binary count their turing machine
[20:58] the head is located at the right most in
[21:00] this case
[21:01] on on the one and you can see we are
[21:04] also in state
[21:05] q 0 0. and state q 0
[21:08] 0 we can see it in the diagram that's
[21:10] this state here
[21:12] so now we see that we are positioned
[21:15] above the 1.
[21:17] if we are positioned above the 1 that's
[21:19] what this means
[21:20] in that case we shall write a 1
[21:24] in the same square and then we shall go
[21:26] to the state q1
[21:28] and we shall take a step to the left so
[21:30] we can try that
[21:33] there so we did that we read the one
[21:37] we wrote the one so it's the same as it
[21:39] was
[21:40] we moved to state q1 which we are at
[21:43] here now
[21:44] and uh that's it
[21:47] yeah we took a step to the left so we're
[21:50] here now
[21:51] now we are here we will see zero here's
[21:54] the zero
[21:55] we're gonna write the one and then we're
[21:57] gonna go to state q
[21:59] zero and take a step to the right
[22:01] instead
[22:03] there we did that and then it proceeds
[22:06] like this
[22:08] here we will do the same thing actually
[22:10] but so what we can also see
[22:12] here in this for this to work as a
[22:13] binary counter
[22:15] ignore this uh rightmost digit it's
[22:18] going to be one all the time
[22:19] this is the actual number so we just
[22:21] counted one
[22:22] and if we continue now we will see that
[22:26] there we have 2
[22:29] 3
[22:33] 4 and so on so this is a very very
[22:37] simple turing machine
[22:38] and it does this binary counting until
[22:41] you
[22:41] tell it to stop more or less all right
[22:46] remember also this is the input that's
[22:48] important
[22:51] because we will get back to that
[22:55] now let's move on to a universal turing
[22:58] machine what's a universal turing
[22:59] machine well that's
[23:00] a turing machine that simulates turing
[23:02] machines
[23:04] so here we have the universal training
[23:06] machine it has this particular state
[23:07] machine here
[23:08] that allows it to simulate other turing
[23:12] machines like the binary counter
[23:14] and there are some different universal
[23:16] turing machines
[23:17] um for instance the ones the one that
[23:20] alan turing himself
[23:21] devised actually that had some bugs and
[23:23] it was a bit convoluted so it's not the
[23:25] easiest one to
[23:26] to work with arguably the
[23:30] easiest one to work with at least that i
[23:33] have found
[23:34] is the marvin minsky implementation from
[23:37] 1967.
[23:38] it's a pedagogical version and it's a
[23:40] pretty convoluted
[23:41] uh the universal turing machine anyhow
[23:44] so it's good that we don't
[23:46] take any one of the more convoluted ones
[23:48] we can there are smaller
[23:50] ones than this that have fewer here it
[23:51] is there are fewer states
[23:53] and and fewer and a smaller alphabet but
[23:55] they become more difficult to understand
[23:58] so here is the state machine we'll go
[24:00] into that in detail
[24:01] in addition to the state machine we also
[24:04] have the tape of the universal turing
[24:06] machine
[24:07] so recall the idea is that we want to
[24:09] simulate another jump scene so we're
[24:11] going to have this as an example of what
[24:13] we want to simulate
[24:14] in order for this machine to simulate
[24:16] this machine well it's like a computer
[24:18] running a program
[24:20] first you have to specify what the
[24:21] program is so this has to be written in
[24:24] the form of a program
[24:26] and we will write that on the tape of u
[24:29] and we will write it these are the
[24:32] quintuples that's the description of the
[24:34] turing machine
[24:36] and then also we need to know here in
[24:39] what
[24:40] state this simulated machine which we
[24:43] can call t
[24:45] is is in so first it's in state q zero
[24:47] zero
[24:48] and we will have the state here on the
[24:50] tape
[24:52] and then there is input also for the
[24:54] this turing machine and that input
[24:56] is uh infinite to the left
[25:00] so in this case infinity stretches to
[25:02] the left that's
[25:03] still it will become uh you can simulate
[25:05] anything like this
[25:08] and then this so this m here that is the
[25:11] symbol for the head location location of
[25:14] the head of this machine
[25:16] the problem if you have an m here is
[25:18] that you don't see what symbol it's
[25:19] really
[25:20] located above so we have that located we
[25:23] have that here instead so
[25:24] in this case it's located above the
[25:25] symbol one
[25:28] then we will have a y here which
[25:30] separates
[25:31] the uh the tape
[25:34] the input and the tape of the to the t
[25:37] the
[25:37] turing machine that used to be simulated
[25:39] we have an x here
[25:41] before the description of the program
[25:45] and now the program it's supposed to
[25:48] describe this
[25:49] it does that by describing each one of
[25:52] these transitions
[25:54] so it does it here is a description of
[25:57] one transition
[25:58] if you're in the state q0 this one
[26:01] and you read a zero here then you should
[26:04] go back to q
[26:05] zero zero so we're going back you should
[26:07] write the zero here
[26:09] and then you should take a step to the
[26:11] right
[26:12] and so these are so there are four
[26:14] transitions here there are four
[26:16] of these quintuples as minsky calls them
[26:19] and because we want to have this program
[26:22] in only
[26:24] in binary format we get rid of the q
[26:26] here
[26:27] and so we have zero zero and then we
[26:30] trade r and l right and left for one and
[26:34] zero
[26:35] so for the first quintuple for this
[26:38] transition
[26:39] we will have zero zero zero zero zero
[26:42] zero zero zero one
[26:44] and that is located here on the tape
[26:47] and this is then placed here
[26:51] so that's the turing machine uh as uh
[26:54] the universal turing machine of
[26:55] martininsky now because it's a bit
[26:58] uh a lot to take in
[27:01] i have a simulation here of this machine
[27:04] let's see if i can go to that
[27:07] oops
[27:12] there so here it is
[27:17] this is the turing machine um
[27:20] the head is located here in the bold
[27:23] large
[27:24] symbol this is the head of the universal
[27:28] turing machine
[27:28] here as mentioned is the head of the
[27:31] simulated turing
[27:33] and now we can take a step we are
[27:35] located here this is the starting point
[27:37] in in state
[27:41] six and it says that if we read
[27:45] a one which we are reading right now
[27:49] uh then we shall write a b
[27:52] and we should go back to the same state
[27:54] and take a step to the left
[27:55] so we can do that look we did that
[27:58] so the 1 was translated to b and then we
[28:01] took a step to the left
[28:03] now it says well if we read a zero then
[28:06] we're going to write an
[28:07] a and go back here and take a step
[28:09] another step to the left
[28:12] so now we have an a here and you can
[28:14] note there are b's and a's
[28:16] this minsky machine uses a's and b's
[28:19] as uh proxies for zero and one it would
[28:23] be translating
[28:24] zeros to a's and b's to one back and
[28:27] forth
[28:27] just in order to keep track of where it
[28:29] is in its execution
[28:31] so every time you see an a think zero
[28:33] and every time you say b
[28:34] think one so we continue uh
[28:37] there's uh now it says zero it's gonna
[28:40] go
[28:41] uh uh do the same thing again it may
[28:43] creates an a after that now we get a y
[28:46] if this has a y here then we're going to
[28:48] jump over to state two here
[28:50] and we're gonna write a y also let's see
[28:54] step yes so we and and now
[28:58] we're moving right because there's an r
[29:00] here we see an
[29:01] a there's an a here so we take a step
[29:05] and we end up here now here is an
[29:07] important thing
[29:08] when we are here you can see that we
[29:10] have specified what happens
[29:12] if you see a zero and if you say one but
[29:15] what we're looking at is an
[29:16] a so what happens now is that
[29:19] there is an implicit quintuple that
[29:22] is very important in the minsky
[29:24] implementation the most common
[29:26] quintuples are not
[29:27] there are no arrows here because it
[29:29] becomes very cluttered so it's very
[29:30] simple to say that
[29:32] so when you don't have a an arrow here
[29:35] for
[29:35] a transition what the machine is going
[29:37] to do is it's going to
[29:39] write the same thing as it wrote it's
[29:42] going to
[29:43] go back to the state that it's in and
[29:45] it's going to take a step
[29:46] as specified in the uh
[29:50] in the state symbol here to the right so
[29:53] we take a step
[29:54] you see it doesn't touch this it leaves
[29:57] it
[29:57] untouched it stays in the same state but
[30:00] it takes a step to the right
[30:02] and that happens again now and again
[30:05] now it sees a zero and so here it takes
[30:08] a step
[30:08] uh and it jumps over to to the next
[30:12] state
[30:12] so we took nine steps now we're going to
[30:15] take hundreds of steps
[30:17] and what we're going to do here is that
[30:19] we're going to go through
[30:20] four phases the first in order to
[30:23] simulate the
[30:24] the binary count the first phase it
[30:26] identifies
[30:28] what um program
[30:31] quintuple what program statement is
[30:34] going to be executed so if you recall
[30:38] the m here was standing on top of the
[30:40] letter
[30:41] one uh the symbol one and in the binary
[30:45] state machine
[30:46] if that is the case uh then this is the
[30:50] transition you're standing in the
[30:52] transition
[30:53] in the state 0 0 in the binary machine
[30:55] you're looking at the one
[30:57] what you want to do now is you want to
[30:58] go to the state
[31:00] 0 1 you want to write the one and then
[31:04] you want to take a step
[31:05] to the left that's what this means so
[31:08] this machine now the universal machine
[31:10] needs to identify
[31:11] that this is actually the program the
[31:13] queen tuple the program statement that
[31:15] we want to execute
[31:16] so it's going to first trying to find it
[31:19] and it's looking first at the first one
[31:21] it doesn't find it
[31:23] and then so then it marks it like this
[31:25] with a's and b's that indicates that
[31:27] okay i've seen that one now
[31:29] now it's going to try to find it here
[31:31] and we will find it this time
[31:34] so it's moving this is zero good and
[31:36] here's a zero good and now it's going to
[31:39] match the b here with the one here
[31:42] and that's also right so now it's found
[31:45] the the
[31:46] proper the proper quintuplet that it
[31:49] will execute
[31:51] now in the next state what it's going to
[31:53] do is it's going to take
[31:56] this second part of the queen tube what
[31:59] am i going to do it identified already i
[32:01] was here
[32:02] i read at the state 0
[32:06] 0 i read read a one i want to go
[32:09] to state 0 1 now and i'm going to write
[32:11] the one
[32:12] so it's going to take this and it's
[32:14] going to copy it into this
[32:16] location in the universal turing machine
[32:19] recall
[32:20] this location is where it's at right now
[32:22] so it's at location
[32:24] at state 0 and it's seeing a 1. now in
[32:27] the next
[32:28] after it's completed this uh this
[32:30] iteration it's going to be
[32:32] in state zero one so we want to have
[32:34] state zero one here
[32:36] and it's going to still have the one
[32:37] there so we can
[32:39] play this now and let it uh
[32:43] perform that you can see now that it's
[32:45] in phase there oops we went a little bit
[32:47] too fast
[32:48] um
[32:52] that the in the second phase
[32:58] there now we are
[33:02] completed in copying here we just copied
[33:05] the next instruction now what we want to
[33:08] do
[33:09] is we actually want to write something
[33:11] here under the
[33:12] head of the simulated machine and so
[33:16] if i move a little bit quickly here we
[33:18] just move to the next phase i click the
[33:20] next phase button and we don't have to
[33:22] take all the steps individually
[33:24] you see now we wrote something here and
[33:27] now we want to move the head
[33:29] one step here the m is going to move
[33:32] here because that's what the binary
[33:34] counter wants to do it wants to move a
[33:35] step to the left
[33:39] and there it did that okay
[33:42] so if we play this now fast you will see
[33:46] that it's mostly occupied with trying to
[33:48] find what statements
[33:49] it's go it should execute what
[33:52] quintuples are relevant
[33:53] and to copy that into its own state
[33:57] but occasionally it wanders out here to
[33:59] the tape of the simulator machine and
[34:02] actually performs this
[34:03] binary counting so you can see here that
[34:06] it's
[34:06] slowly counting up
[34:09] and so you have a one here now that's
[34:13] it didn't have that before and so so it
[34:15] goes
[34:17] okay so this is a crash course in how
[34:22] universal turing machines work
[34:25] um i hope that you are approximately
[34:29] with me still
[34:31] we'll get back to this but
[34:35] so this is how the minsky uh
[34:38] universal turing machine works now
[34:41] what we wanted to do was to hack it and
[34:44] if you want to hack something you first
[34:46] have to find a vulnerability
[34:48] and and i think uh here that i found one
[34:51] when it and and that is in these um
[34:54] you can see this statement here the most
[34:56] common queen tuples of the form
[34:58] where you start in one state and then
[35:00] you move back to the
[35:02] same state and you write the same symbol
[35:04] they are simply omitted so those are
[35:06] this 140 arrows
[35:10] in the diagram transition transitions
[35:12] that
[35:13] minsky did not explicitly draw
[35:17] but had implicitly instead and those
[35:21] are necessary 70 of those
[35:24] i have come to the conclusion are
[35:27] necessary for this machine to work
[35:29] but this blanket rule it creates another
[35:32] 70 that are not really necessary
[35:34] they don't do any harm normally they are
[35:37] just not used
[35:38] but what they result in is
[35:42] improper input validation because it
[35:44] becomes possible now
[35:46] for an attacker like myself to
[35:49] um to add symbols to the
[35:53] input that minsky never considered
[35:57] so for instance i can
[36:01] let's see yes
[36:05] i can here
[36:09] is a new tape this looks is the same
[36:10] binary counter
[36:12] but all i did here is that i added an a
[36:14] here on the input
[36:16] and if i add an a to the input here it's
[36:18] not you're not supposed to do that
[36:20] but the minsky machine will accept it
[36:22] and you can see if we now move
[36:23] uh quickly here from we search for the
[36:26] right
[36:27] instruction for the first for the first
[36:30] state transition
[36:32] now we're going to move the uh we're
[36:34] going to write something under the a
[36:36] under the m now we're going to write the
[36:40] m
[36:40] the m should be written here because the
[36:41] m was here that's the tape head
[36:44] the tape head can move only one step so
[36:46] it should only be able to move here or
[36:48] here
[36:49] but because i wrote an a here what
[36:52] happens if we step through this is that
[36:53] it when
[36:54] it arrives at here at this a it does
[36:57] what it should do
[36:58] it's in this state state 23 it sees an
[37:02] a it writes a a one
[37:06] and then when it gets here it's supposed
[37:09] to write an m
[37:10] because it's expecting a zero or a one
[37:12] and now it's supposed to write an
[37:13] m this means that it has moved the head
[37:15] of the simulated machine
[37:17] one step to the left but it sees an a
[37:19] instead because it says this a
[37:21] it drops it falls back on these implicit
[37:24] quantum so what we would do we would
[37:27] simply write an a in the same place
[37:29] so it won't touch it and it will take a
[37:31] step to the left
[37:33] so you see it takes a step to the left
[37:35] and now it's in the same position and
[37:37] now
[37:38] it's going to write the m so all that
[37:40] happened was that the m was supposed to
[37:42] be written here
[37:43] but it was written there and actually
[37:45] this
[37:46] little hiccup it's just like a stutter
[37:50] if we play this now it will you
[37:53] it won't matter it will kind of uh
[37:56] recuperate from this small error and you
[37:59] can see that a is gone and now it's just
[38:01] doing the binary counting again so just
[38:05] writing some random symbols there it
[38:08] may have an effect and may not
[38:12] now to hack this now uh
[38:21] that means the following er i i i remind
[38:24] you of the sql injection
[38:26] the input that's where you write the
[38:28] malicious stuff
[38:30] and it gets in in this sql statement it
[38:32] gets added here
[38:33] so in arbitrary code execution you kind
[38:36] of write your
[38:37] you write your program in the place
[38:40] where you're supposed to write data
[38:42] and so it's the same thing that we want
[38:44] to do here this is the place
[38:46] for the data to the binary counter
[38:50] and here is where we then have as a
[38:53] this is the input so this is what we
[38:56] have to
[38:57] play with as a hacker so we're not
[38:59] allowed to modify the binary
[39:01] count the binary program and not the
[39:02] state or anything like that we can only
[39:04] modify
[39:05] the input and so is there anything that
[39:08] we can write here
[39:09] that can achieve arbitrary code
[39:11] execution that's the question
[39:15] and so what we want to do is the
[39:17] following we have
[39:20] this tape we have this input
[39:23] and we're running this machine but we
[39:26] want to end up in
[39:27] this state in this tape which is our own
[39:30] machine and this of course
[39:32] because we are hackers this is an eraser
[39:34] it will erase everything it's like drop
[39:36] table
[39:36] but on a turing machine so what it's
[39:38] going to do is the
[39:39] independent on if it is a one or a zero
[39:42] it's just going to write a zero
[39:43] take a step to the left and then it's
[39:45] going to write the zero and take a step
[39:47] to the left so it's just going to erase
[39:49] the whole type
[39:50] that's what we want to achieve so is
[39:52] there anything we can write here
[39:54] that makes uh that makes
[39:57] the machine the universal turing machine
[39:59] execute this
[40:01] so we have to get this onto the tape and
[40:04] then we also
[40:05] have to make sure that the universal
[40:08] turing machine
[40:08] the head is located in the right
[40:10] position
[40:12] and that it is in the right the
[40:14] universal turing machine is in the
[40:15] starting state
[40:16] if we can achieve all of that then it
[40:19] will execute this program instead of
[40:21] this program
[40:23] okay so
[40:26] uh we could brute force this we could
[40:29] try
[40:30] just all the strings possible for this
[40:33] uh here we could try all strings and see
[40:36] if we randomly happen upon
[40:40] this particular one this is really
[40:43] really difficult
[40:45] for one thing it is there are eight
[40:49] symbols
[40:49] and the string is
[40:53] the number of permutations here is eight
[40:55] to the power of n
[40:56] which is uh with the exponent i will
[40:59] show you later
[41:00] 8 to the power 28 that's just too big
[41:03] to uh to brute force and for the
[41:05] computer scientists here we can also
[41:08] uh speculate about whether hacking in
[41:11] this this
[41:11] sense if it's what the computational
[41:15] complexity of this problem is
[41:18] but i won't go into that instead
[41:21] um in order to find
[41:25] that magical string that we place here
[41:29] in order to find that without brute
[41:31] forcing we need some inspiration
[41:34] and the inspiration that that
[41:38] i uh
[41:41] employed was from another kind of
[41:46] arbitrary code execution vulnerability
[41:48] that's common which is the stack buffer
[41:50] overflow
[41:51] when you write the program in for
[41:53] instance seed
[41:54] you can have functions when that program
[41:57] is executing
[41:58] the functions will be represented as a
[42:02] as a stack frame so it's a memory
[42:05] a piece of memory it's called a stack
[42:07] frame and here you will have local
[42:09] variables
[42:10] and these buffers here you will also
[42:12] because you're in a function you need to
[42:14] know how to get
[42:15] back from that function to the calling
[42:17] function and therefore the return
[42:18] pointer is written here in the stack
[42:21] and there's some other stuff here also
[42:23] now if there is a buffer overflow
[42:25] vulnerability
[42:26] in in a program that means that
[42:30] this buffer or this buffer can be
[42:31] overwritten it can become
[42:33] uh too long and there's no input
[42:36] validation
[42:37] so so it is allowed that it becomes too
[42:40] long if this becomes too long then it
[42:42] will write over the return pointer
[42:44] and so here is a smashed stack as it's
[42:47] called
[42:48] where the attacker has written over
[42:51] the return pointer and written the
[42:53] attacker's own
[42:54] return or pointer and now when the
[42:57] program
[42:58] counter reaches this and wants to return
[43:03] there's another pointer here that
[43:05] doesn't point back to the calling
[43:06] function anymore
[43:07] this new pointer it calls right in to
[43:10] this buffer
[43:11] and in that buffer is located malicious
[43:14] code that the attacker added
[43:16] so this is a buffer overflow and so the
[43:19] the trick
[43:20] is that you kind of include the
[43:23] code that you want to execute you
[43:25] include it in
[43:27] the uh in the data because it's
[43:30] as an attacker this buffer you feel it
[43:33] it's typically data that maybe you
[43:34] filled into some
[43:35] some dialogue forms or some some
[43:39] with some user data okay so that's the
[43:42] inspiration
[43:43] so i was thinking that well
[43:47] as i said we have this program the
[43:49] binary counter
[43:50] we have this that we want to fill with
[43:52] something but and we want to achieve
[43:55] this program
[43:59] how about we simply write the program
[44:02] that we want to have
[44:03] oops in the data section
[44:06] so we just take this what we want to
[44:08] have and we just write it here
[44:10] how would that work we can try that
[44:14] so we go to the simulator
[44:18] and we now move to this this
[44:21] let's see here um
[44:30] there so here we are at the um
[44:34] the naive exploit attempt so here is our
[44:37] program that we want to have executed
[44:41] but we put it in the data section
[44:43] and the machine the universal turing
[44:46] machine it's in state six
[44:47] it's located uh with a tape head here in
[44:50] this machine condition
[44:51] which is where it should be and if we
[44:54] start playing this
[44:57] we will see that we won't achieve any
[45:00] arbitrary code execution as you can see
[45:02] it's executing these statements
[45:04] that's where it's spending all the time
[45:06] and it's moving this head as it did
[45:08] before
[45:09] it would be a little bit confused
[45:10] because there's a y here but
[45:12] that just creates a stutter and it will
[45:16] continue with its binary counting as
[45:18] best it can
[45:19] given that there's a y there but we'll
[45:21] just continue doing binary counting over
[45:23] here it's not going to execute any code
[45:25] that i wrote here it's just going to
[45:26] change that
[45:27] code that i wrote there into something
[45:29] which is a legit
[45:31] well something meaningless probably is
[45:33] going to do binary counting on my code
[45:36] so that doesn't work um we cannot
[45:41] simply write the
[45:45] exploit in in the data section so i
[45:48] spent quite some time
[45:49] uh trial with trial and error and then i
[45:52] came up with
[45:53] something that looks like this instead
[45:56] so here is the working exploit
[45:58] and so uh one of the important things is
[46:01] that
[46:02] i had to change the zeros and ones to
[46:04] a's and b's
[46:05] uh if i do that then that will trick the
[46:08] machine
[46:09] in in important ways
[46:12] i also had to remove some symbols at the
[46:15] end that were not really necessary
[46:17] of the of the original program i had to
[46:20] add some other symbols
[46:22] here and here that having done all these
[46:24] things i actually
[46:25] achieved this arbitrary code execution
[46:28] now we can now see
[46:29] how that works so
[46:32] now here is the malicious
[46:37] tape and the malicious input so we are
[46:39] standing here this is the binary counter
[46:42] as always
[46:43] and here is the head of the simulated
[46:46] tape but
[46:47] here now is my my malicious program
[46:52] and here is the input to that program
[46:54] there
[46:56] so my malicious but i just wrote this
[46:57] here
[46:59] and we can see so i can i have executed
[47:02] that
[47:02] universal turing machine on this tape
[47:04] many times and i can tell you that
[47:05] nothing particular happens in the first
[47:07] three phases so we can just rapidly jump
[47:10] through them
[47:11] the first phase identifies which of the
[47:14] binary counter
[47:16] quintuples we want to execute the second
[47:19] one does the copying
[47:21] into into the machine state here
[47:24] there the third phase writes
[47:28] well here's the m now it's going to
[47:30] write then a there
[47:31] that's just as it should be completely
[47:33] legitimate
[47:35] now what it's going to do what it wants
[47:37] to do is it's about to place the
[47:39] m which represents the turing the the
[47:42] simulator machine's head
[47:43] wants to place it should place it here
[47:45] on the s but
[47:47] as we saw previously if we
[47:50] when it gets to that point first it
[47:53] changes this a
[47:54] to a one which it should do and now it's
[47:57] looking for a zero or a one
[47:58] just like we had previously it c is not
[48:00] a zero and a one
[48:02] so it uh takes a step and now it sees an
[48:04] a it takes another step
[48:06] and so what happens here is the really
[48:08] critical part that
[48:09] it kind of just slides all the way over
[48:12] here
[48:15] to this one and now finally it
[48:19] a zero and a one so what happens here is
[48:22] that that
[48:22] we're in a really weird state um
[48:26] in the original or in the simulated
[48:27] machine the binary machine is not
[48:29] the binary counter it's not supposed to
[48:31] be able to move the tape head here
[48:33] because when it gets here now you take
[48:34] another step
[48:35] it places the m here so the m jumped
[48:38] from
[48:39] here this one it was where it was at
[48:42] over here that should not be possible
[48:43] that's like impossible
[48:45] but but that's what happened here
[48:50] um so now we are in a uh
[48:53] a weird state but this does not mean
[48:56] that uh that the attacker controls
[48:58] anything here
[48:59] so um now
[49:02] we take say a few more steps
[49:06] and we see that we're waiting for the s
[49:08] here that's because we want to get back
[49:10] here to the machine condition of the
[49:13] original program
[49:14] but i place this malicious s here so
[49:17] eventually
[49:18] when we get to that point it stops early
[49:22] so it stops already here that's
[49:24] important so that it doesn't go back to
[49:26] the original program
[49:28] and then it ends up in the starting
[49:30] state
[49:31] but now it's in a weird state because
[49:32] when you hear in the starting state you
[49:34] should really be
[49:35] here it should be standing above this
[49:38] symbol or this symbol i don't remember
[49:40] one of these
[49:41] but we are here i would like as an
[49:43] attacker
[49:44] to be here in my machine condition this
[49:46] is the machine condition of
[49:48] my program i would like to be here but
[49:50] we're not anywhere
[49:52] so we're in the middle so unfortunately
[49:56] if we simply step through this and
[50:00] we it will the first thing it would it
[50:03] would
[50:04] actually walk up to my machine condition
[50:06] and now it's going to try to find
[50:08] my uh the first statement in my code but
[50:12] because it sees only a's and b's here it
[50:13] doesn't find anything
[50:15] so it goes and it finds some kind of
[50:18] random stuff
[50:20] down here this is just a buffer that it
[50:23] finds
[50:24] so
[50:28] now it goes through a whole cycle of
[50:30] execution
[50:31] doing more or less useless work for both
[50:34] me
[50:34] and for the original program designer of
[50:38] the binary counter
[50:40] but eventually it gets back here and
[50:44] uh it here comes
[50:47] soon the the magic part where my a's and
[50:50] b's
[50:51] that i've written here are are now
[50:54] magically
[50:56] transformed here into
[50:59] ones and zeros this is a cleanup
[51:02] operation that's supposed to do
[51:04] but look now we are really
[51:07] very close to what i would like to have
[51:10] namely
[51:11] state yeah so now we are there
[51:14] here we are in state six the starting
[51:17] state
[51:17] but we are in my machine condition where
[51:20] i want
[51:21] the the head to be and here we have my
[51:24] program it's formatted perfectly in
[51:26] zeros and ones just like i wanted it to
[51:28] be as an attacker
[51:30] and and here is the the the resulting
[51:34] paper
[51:35] of this of my machine and so now if you
[51:38] play this
[51:39] it will never return to the original
[51:41] program it's going to execute my program
[51:43] instead
[51:44] so if we play this you can see that
[51:47] that's exactly what it does
[51:48] and this tape here it's going to erase
[51:51] the ones here
[51:52] and turn them into zeros and eventually
[51:55] turning all of this into erasing the
[51:57] whole input to that
[52:00] so that's it that's the um
[52:04] [Music]
[52:05] arbitrary code execution in the marvin
[52:08] minsky implementation of the universal
[52:10] turing machine
[52:12] um i'm imagining that for it should be
[52:16] issued for most people it should
[52:17] probably be quite difficult to follow in
[52:19] everything of this
[52:20] i try to make this as pedagogical as i
[52:22] can but it is uh
[52:24] a lot of stuff but i hope that maybe
[52:27] uh at least you you uh caught
[52:30] caught the greater scheme uh
[52:34] here and and so what we can see
[52:37] then from this uh is that it is possible
[52:41] to achieve this arbitrary code execution
[52:43] on the um turing machine the universal
[52:47] turing machine
[52:48] and then we can consider if we want to
[52:50] mitigate this if we would
[52:52] like to prevent this how would we go
[52:54] about it
[52:56] and there are some things that you can
[52:57] do um
[53:00] recall that we have uh improper input
[53:03] validation
[53:04] that's the uh the main flaw in many
[53:07] different programs and
[53:10] that causes vulnerabilities and here
[53:12] it's the same so we could
[53:14] validate the inputs we could do that by
[53:16] having another turing machine
[53:18] like we append it to the universal
[53:20] during machine
[53:21] that makes sure that we only get the
[53:22] proper input of course that will add
[53:24] complexity to the machine which is not
[53:26] going to be as simple as
[53:28] the marvin minsky machine because we
[53:29] need this added layer of security
[53:32] another thing that we could do would be
[53:34] to um
[53:36] as you recall the vulnerability is based
[53:38] on at least partially
[53:40] on these implicit queen tuples
[53:43] these transitions between the
[53:46] from the same state to the same state um
[53:50] that minsky defined as a kind of blanket
[53:53] so there were 140 of those but only 70
[53:56] are needed
[53:57] so we could draw 70 more arrows in this
[54:00] diagram
[54:00] i think there are 45 transitions here we
[54:03] can draw 70 more
[54:04] and then only allow those that would
[54:07] prevent my expert from working
[54:09] so that but that also is i mean that
[54:11] adds another kind of complexity
[54:13] i mean in the specification of the
[54:16] machine
[54:16] becomes more complex we could possibly
[54:20] use
[54:20] a special alphabet for teas tape now
[54:22] we're using zeros and ones and we also
[54:24] have zeros and ones for the program so
[54:26] there's
[54:27] it's easy to become confused here um
[54:30] but it may or may not work to do that
[54:34] another final thing that that i thought
[54:36] that one could do is that there are some
[54:38] specific parameters that you can use
[54:40] here for instance between the m and the
[54:42] y
[54:43] between the head of the starting
[54:46] position
[54:47] of the head of the simulator machine
[54:50] and the end of the tape
[54:54] of the simulated machine here we have
[54:56] three
[54:57] zeros according to minsky you can have
[54:59] any arbitrary number
[55:01] if we have three or four or five or six
[55:03] or a million
[55:04] my exploit works but if we have one or
[55:07] two
[55:07] my expert doesn't work maybe there's
[55:09] another exploit that does work i don't
[55:11] know
[55:11] but mine doesn't so maybe it's possible
[55:13] to find some specific parameters that
[55:15] make
[55:16] this machine unexploitable that could be
[55:20] okay now um i would like to
[55:25] step back so
[55:28] this was uh feels to me a very
[55:31] rapid attempt to explain
[55:35] the details of this arbitrary code
[55:37] execution of this
[55:38] minsky implementation of the universal
[55:40] turing machine
[55:42] so if we return to the question
[55:45] of why computers so often are insecure
[55:49] it seems to me that that might be
[55:50] related to to this
[55:53] to me really surprising
[55:56] discovery that that even the simplest
[55:59] imaginable computer
[56:02] is vulnerable to this rather complicated
[56:06] and and rather magical kind of attack
[56:10] why is that why is it that that
[56:14] this machine is is vulnerable
[56:17] in this fashion and so a hypothesis is
[56:20] that but
[56:21] is it the case that computers in general
[56:23] that they are intrinsically brittle
[56:26] that at their very core they have this
[56:28] propensity like
[56:30] a like a like a a trait that they really
[56:32] want
[56:33] that propensity that they're leaning
[56:35] towards that they really want to have
[56:38] uh arbitrary code execution
[56:40] vulnerabilities that
[56:41] it's in their nature to have arbitrary
[56:44] code execution vulnerabilities they
[56:46] don't necessarily have to have it
[56:48] but they are perhaps likely to have it
[56:52] i mean it is is that the case that there
[56:54] is some kind of intrinsic writtenness so
[56:56] that's
[56:57] uh that's that's a question that one
[56:58] might ask um
[57:02] what one can consider then um what the
[57:05] root causes of insecurity
[57:07] might be and there are a number of
[57:09] hypothesis that many of you have surely
[57:11] heard about previously also
[57:14] one for instance the grand old man of
[57:18] computer security bruce schneier says
[57:20] that
[57:22] complexity is the enemy of security and
[57:26] it is true that
[57:26] very often systems become insecure
[57:29] because they are very complex
[57:31] but here we have the least complex
[57:34] machine
[57:34] possible you cannot have a less complex
[57:38] computer but it's still vulnerable
[57:41] and so to me it seems like complexity
[57:43] cannot be the only answer at least
[57:45] to to why why we find these problems
[57:50] another hypothesis is what's just human
[57:53] felibe
[57:54] humans make mistakes that's why we have
[57:56] vulnerabilities and that's also i think
[57:58] true
[57:58] that almost every time there's a
[58:00] vulnerability there was somebody
[58:02] who forgot to do something or messed up
[58:05] somehow and you can easily patch almost
[58:07] all vulnerabilities by just fixing the
[58:09] problem that some human
[58:10] caused and in this case you could say
[58:12] well minsky he caused the problem here
[58:14] because he didn't consider security of
[58:16] course he was completely
[58:17] uninterested in security when he created
[58:19] this machine
[58:20] but to me it's weird that he was
[58:24] totally uninterested in security when he
[58:26] created this machine but he happened to
[58:28] create a vulnerable machine
[58:30] i mean it could have happened to create
[58:31] a secure machine but that didn't happen
[58:34] it happened to be vulnerable so this is
[58:36] uh for the propensity hypothesis that it
[58:39] kind of
[58:40] happen it easily happens
[58:43] another hypothesis is that john von
[58:45] neumann store the program
[58:47] architecture that the program
[58:51] and the data is stored on the same in
[58:53] the same memory causes
[58:55] confusion and in this turing machine
[58:57] they're stored on the same tape that
[58:59] causes confusion the minsky machine
[59:01] becomes confused it thinks that the data
[59:03] is the program
[59:04] and that's a cause of problems so there
[59:06] are other architectures like harvard
[59:08] architecture where
[59:09] the pro program and the data are sort of
[59:11] different memories and maybe that could
[59:13] be some kind of solution but
[59:14] still if you want to have a computer in
[59:17] any meaningful
[59:18] way you will have to be able to update
[59:20] and rewrite the code
[59:22] in the program memory and then you kind
[59:23] of fall back into the same problem again
[59:27] there's also the concept of weird
[59:29] machines
[59:31] the the the the paper that's cited at
[59:33] the bottom here
[59:35] there's thomas dalian and there's also
[59:37] uh sergey
[59:38] bratus people who have been talking for
[59:42] a long time about
[59:43] the concept of weird machines and we
[59:44] really see weird machines in action here
[59:46] when you are at this in this machine
[59:50] at a certain point there is this weird
[59:52] unexpected input
[59:54] and you end up in a strange state that
[59:57] is
[59:57] not possible really to represent in the
[59:59] state diagram
[60:00] at the simulated level anymore like the
[60:04] head of the machine jumps 20 steps to
[60:07] the left
[60:07] that's not supposed to be possible in
[60:09] this in a state machine like this
[60:11] but then it's possible to kind of bring
[60:14] it back into a sane
[60:16] state in this case and and and it will
[60:18] continue executing
[60:20] in this instead and so i'm not sure
[60:22] whether weird machines can explain
[60:24] insecurity but there is it can i think
[60:27] explain
[60:28] at least or or formalize exploitation in
[60:31] a certain sense
[60:34] so i'm thinking that there's
[60:38] one other perspective on arbitrary code
[60:41] execution hacking and
[60:43] maybe we can generalize it to hacking it
[60:44] would be nice but
[60:46] let's stick to orbitary code execution
[60:47] having hacking because
[60:49] that is the discovery so a hacker
[60:52] discovers that the turing machine t
[60:54] the binary counter simulated on you the
[60:58] universal term machine
[60:59] we discover as a hacker that that turing
[61:02] machine t
[61:02] is in set it's it's itself is in fact
[61:06] also a universal turing machine so that
[61:09] we can run yet another program
[61:11] on that so it's a turing machine that
[61:13] simulates a turing machine that
[61:14] simulates a turing machine
[61:16] and so what happens is this program is
[61:19] accidentally turing complete it was not
[61:22] intended to be
[61:23] and the concept of accidental turing
[61:26] completeness
[61:27] that is uh not a new concept um
[61:30] there are other things that are
[61:31] accidentally turned complete
[61:33] we saw that you can create turing
[61:35] machines in lego and minecraft and
[61:37] in the x86 uh computer architecture
[61:40] there's the
[61:41] mob instruction move that
[61:44] it's it alone is sufficient to
[61:47] to perform any kind of computation so
[61:50] it's turing complete
[61:51] it turns out that musical notation can
[61:54] also be turing complete and there's this
[61:55] card game which is called
[61:57] magic the gathering that i have never
[61:58] played but that also turns out to be
[62:01] turing complete so there's a paper on
[62:02] that you can see at the bottom there
[62:04] and of course there are these smallest
[62:07] turing machines that claude shannon was
[62:09] interested in
[62:10] and also uh steven wolfram has been
[62:13] recently interested in the smaller
[62:16] sewing machine
[62:17] he came up with the idea of well a
[62:19] suggested small steering machine of
[62:21] i think it was maybe two states and
[62:23] three symbols or three symbols and two
[62:25] states
[62:27] and that's a bit contested whether that
[62:29] really
[62:30] is it is true and complete but
[62:34] but that you can create these very small
[62:36] turing machines
[62:37] it also speaks to that and that these
[62:40] things accidentally become too
[62:42] incomplete
[62:42] it's not so unlikely that things
[62:46] become too incomplete and so that's why
[62:50] that's why the concept of accidental
[62:52] during completeness
[62:53] is and so so then to conclude
[62:57] um the
[63:00] perhaps it is the case that computers
[63:03] are intrinsically brittle and that they
[63:05] have this propensity for arbitrary code
[63:07] execution because
[63:08] accidental turing completeness is is
[63:11] common
[63:12] um it's not so hard for that to happen
[63:15] it can happen
[63:16] quite easily in fact and given in
[63:18] particular perhaps
[63:20] it seems if you're simulating on a
[63:22] universal term machine it becomes even
[63:23] more
[63:24] likely so um
[63:27] i will leave you with this very
[63:29] hypothetical conclusion
[63:32] and and i think i will end there
[63:36] um thank you great thank you
[63:39] so much i clap my hands already for for
[63:42] the audience that is not visible to us
[63:45] here
[63:46] so um
[63:50] basically you you made it quite
[63:52] difficult to ask questions because you
[63:53] covered so many aspects already in the
[63:55] talk
[63:55] so very good so you were perfectly
[63:57] prepared thank you for that
[63:59] so let me start with the with the
[64:01] provocative
[64:02] question you you probably talked about
[64:03] it already but maybe you can say a
[64:05] little bit more about it so
[64:07] um what the heck motivated you to do
[64:09] this research
[64:10] or to ask a little bit more
[64:13] um defined what i really want to know is
[64:16] like
[64:17] what was your goal was it like you
[64:19] wanted to create a piece of
[64:20] art you wanted to have a philosophical
[64:23] discussion you wanted to educate
[64:25] people maybe you can say something to
[64:28] that
[64:28] direction it was actually
[64:31] i would say there was it was a personal
[64:34] curiosity
[64:35] that drove me uh to this and i think
[64:37] that from my own perspective as i as
[64:40] i mentioned initially i have had also
[64:43] some i have been thinking about
[64:45] uh why it is that that security is such
[64:48] an issue and it's been really difficult
[64:50] for me to understand why we can't build
[64:52] secure systems what is it
[64:53] fundamentally that is the the reason for
[64:56] that and so
[64:57] i think that was one thing that that
[65:00] was kind of lying around the back of my
[65:03] head
[65:04] and then in computer science you stumble
[65:07] across the turing machine every now and
[65:08] then and so these two
[65:10] concepts i i guess they just coincided
[65:13] in my head at some point
[65:14] and and at the same time that i had some
[65:17] spare time
[65:18] because this was really just a hobby
[65:21] project for myself
[65:23] with and it is divorced from my my
[65:26] actual uh ordinary research work
[65:30] very good very good so yeah maybe alex i
[65:33] hand over to you
[65:34] for the first audience question
[65:38] okay there are some questions thank you
[65:40] for the presentation
[65:42] which was very interesting a pontus so
[65:44] there were a few questions i will
[65:46] try as usual to group them by
[65:50] theme so i will first
[65:54] begin with the more global questions
[65:57] to begin uh easily so marcia pilami
[66:01] had some few questions and the first one
[66:04] was
[66:04] what inspired you to do this research
[66:08] yeah well that's pretty much uh the
[66:11] question that i answered previously i
[66:13] think
[66:15] so so i was
[66:18] inspired by by i think mainly the
[66:21] question of why
[66:22] um why what is the root cause of
[66:25] security or insecurity
[66:28] okay and so all the questions related to
[66:31] your work
[66:32] uh what can today's software developers
[66:34] learn from your work
[66:36] and how can your work be included in
[66:37] teaching
[66:40] yes well those are questions that i have
[66:42] not really had
[66:44] had the uh had well i have not really
[66:47] considered
[66:47] um well
[66:51] it's i think that in computer science
[66:54] actually we i had
[66:55] a guy uh uh andreas
[66:59] uh rosec who um they contacted me after
[67:02] this ended up in the
[67:03] the paper and in the news uh
[67:07] and he wanted to replicate the uh uh
[67:11] this this hack but on his own
[67:13] implementation or another implementation
[67:15] of the turing machine
[67:17] and so we had some uh very intense back
[67:20] and forth to try to
[67:21] make sure that because he didn't succeed
[67:24] initially
[67:25] and so i thought whoa what if i what if
[67:27] i
[67:28] made some mistakes somewhere but uh but
[67:30] fortunately
[67:31] it turned out that there were no
[67:32] mistakes and instead it's been
[67:34] replicated
[67:35] but he wanted to use it in education um
[67:38] because he's teaching turing machines
[67:40] and he thought that it was really
[67:41] uh interesting that that this phenomenon
[67:44] exists in in in those turing machines or
[67:48] can
[67:49] can exist so i guess you can use it like
[67:52] that
[67:52] um personally i think that the
[67:56] the philosophical dimensions to it are
[67:58] the ones that uh
[68:00] that triggered me the most uh and i
[68:02] don't think i'm
[68:03] done yet with uh thinking about this
[68:05] like i had this slide on
[68:07] and the uh the mp hardness
[68:11] of of hacking uh maybe there's something
[68:14] there
[68:15] i don't know but i'm a bit explorative i
[68:18] must say about what the
[68:20] potential uh real world implications of
[68:22] this might be or the common questions or
[68:25] if there are any any useful things that
[68:27] one can actually take away from this
[68:29] there was in the uh in the very brief
[68:33] statement that was propagated
[68:36] with the vulnerability disclosure in in
[68:39] all these
[68:40] channels where all official
[68:42] vulnerabilities end up
[68:43] the the people at the miter who who were
[68:47] at the data the vulnerability database
[68:49] they had added
[68:50] the author states that there are no real
[68:52] world implications
[68:54] uh of this vulnerability which of course
[68:58] as compared to a vulnerability and you
[69:00] know the
[69:01] smb service of microsoft there are
[69:03] really none here
[69:06] so maybe there are none i don't know but
[69:08] maybe there are
[69:09] okay so let me maybe jump in here
[69:13] so because we when when we get in
[69:15] contact we discussed a little bit of
[69:17] that
[69:17] also and uh i told you like i i love the
[69:20] work because it's really
[69:22] um pure
[69:25] pure approach for teaching because it's
[69:27] uh the uh also the
[69:29] simple story well able to understand
[69:32] computer where you show this honorably
[69:35] so
[69:36] great so therefore i for me the answer
[69:38] is it has clear value and it has great
[69:40] value and
[69:41] especially in this teaching direction i
[69:43] think this will be a great idea to
[69:45] explore it further
[69:47] but let me jump in in the question you
[69:48] would talk a little bit about the
[69:50] process so can you give some more
[69:52] details about
[69:53] how how does one start so you have a
[69:55] turing machine and you know that there
[69:56] are
[69:57] like buffer overflows and these this
[69:59] kind of vulnerability from modern
[70:01] computer architectures so what what was
[70:03] your process of going through it how
[70:05] long did it take
[70:06] what were the step backs where you tried
[70:08] something and it didn't work at all so
[70:10] could you share a little bit something
[70:12] about that
[70:14] yes well i think because uh
[70:17] i'm teaching ethical hacking uh so uh
[70:20] that's also a very important i think uh
[70:23] uh say
[70:24] inspiration for this that uh i have been
[70:27] looking at many many exploits of many
[70:30] different systems
[70:31] and some are really fascinating and some
[70:34] are quite trivial
[70:35] but but as security
[70:39] people do you get to know all these
[70:41] kinds of strategies
[70:43] for exploiting things and uh there's
[70:46] there's a really a a quite large gallery
[70:50] of
[70:50] kinds that's also a reason for why it
[70:52] seems to me that
[70:53] there must be something more fundamental
[70:55] because there are all kinds of different
[70:57] vulnerabilities there are cross-site
[70:59] scripting vulnerabilities and there are
[71:00] buffer overflow vulnerabilities and
[71:02] there are
[71:03] cross-site request forgeries and
[71:06] server-side
[71:07] requests forgeries and there's an
[71:09] endless list of already there seems to
[71:10] be no
[71:11] you know theory at all no no no
[71:14] structure to it at all
[71:16] but uh when you learn about all this
[71:19] you you kind of get the feeling for this
[71:22] uh how vulnerabilities can be exploited
[71:25] and so i
[71:26] think that i had that helped me in you
[71:29] know considering
[71:31] what how how exploitation could possibly
[71:34] happen
[71:35] and then i think i guess that i realized
[71:39] that that the machine will actually
[71:41] interpret
[71:43] symbols other than zeros and ones that
[71:46] was a really
[71:47] important milestone for me uh
[71:50] that it will and that it's also that
[71:52] it's that it should i mean that's how
[71:54] it's built
[71:54] it's built to interpret other symbols
[71:56] you will have a's and b's on
[71:58] even out on the tape of the simulated
[72:01] machine
[72:02] uh it's it's just that the user is not
[72:05] supposed to write those symbols there
[72:07] it's it's the machine that's supposed to
[72:09] write those symbols but the machine will
[72:10] actually accept them and so when i
[72:12] realized that that felt
[72:13] very very much like like other exploits
[72:16] that
[72:17] and and you know improper input
[72:18] validation
[72:20] um and then i spent a lot of time
[72:23] in in trying to coerce this machine into
[72:26] you know to executing my program
[72:29] it was easy to get it you know to skip a
[72:32] bit
[72:32] uh to stutter a little bit but to get it
[72:35] to execute my own program
[72:37] that was a lot of trial and error uh i
[72:40] got it
[72:40] halfway but then you know it it slipped
[72:43] back into the old program and they
[72:44] all was lost and so so i had to try
[72:48] many different
[72:52] exploits attempts well before before i
[72:55] succeeded with
[72:56] uh with the one that i that i found
[72:58] eventually
[73:00] and i did this actually i did this uh
[73:02] over a year ago and then i
[73:04] i submitted this as a paper to
[73:07] um was that well i had long discussion
[73:10] actually with the editor of
[73:12] the usenix login
[73:16] magazine um he decided he didn't want to
[73:19] publish this because uh
[73:20] he couldn't see that there was any you
[73:22] know news value in it
[73:25] and then i submitted it to a conference
[73:27] i got some i got some
[73:29] really positive feedback uh because
[73:32] before that
[73:33] i felt that one is this something where
[73:35] there's nothing
[73:36] i got some really positive feedback
[73:38] there but they did they felt that
[73:40] there's no real world implications so we
[73:42] they rejected the paper
[73:44] and then that's when i submitted it to
[73:46] the cd database
[73:48] and then suddenly it ended up in the
[73:50] newspapers
[73:51] so that was the process very very good
[73:55] very good and i i again i really love
[73:57] this because
[73:58] it's very good also for the people that
[74:00] are doing security research just to see
[74:02] it's not spam and there it is but it's
[74:05] always a
[74:06] a little bit like a catch of the flag
[74:08] now with just the machine that you do
[74:10] something you look at what happened so
[74:12] it's really
[74:13] something that one can really explore
[74:15] and this is also what what i laughed
[74:16] about your presentation with the turing
[74:18] machine where you could see the steps
[74:20] and everything is
[74:21] obvious because you can see it but at
[74:23] the same time it's super
[74:24] tricky to then end up with a real code
[74:26] and i can just imagine
[74:28] that how joyful you would have felt
[74:30] probably when you then finally had it
[74:32] and then it was working and then you saw
[74:34] that you can even stack it and so on
[74:36] and so yeah very nice very good um
[74:40] you also talked about the protection so
[74:42] if alex permits me i will also ask
[74:44] this question there so the in modern
[74:47] computer architectures like the uh
[74:49] intel processors and mitigation of such
[74:51] uh
[74:52] problems between memory do you talk
[74:54] about the moment architecture
[74:56] is that you protect parts of the memory
[74:58] so you say okay this is just not
[74:59] executable
[75:01] would could you draw a little bit the
[75:04] relation to that
[75:05] would that be the um solution to go for
[75:09] it if you would now be minsky and say
[75:11] like okay i ship
[75:12] millions of these turing machines how
[75:14] can i mitigate from it or what would you
[75:16] propose
[75:17] yeah i mean that's a good i that's a
[75:19] that's also a
[75:20] perfectly good mitigation that's
[75:22] implemented in most systems that
[75:24] that you specify that you cannot execute
[75:27] uh
[75:28] code uh located in this part of the
[75:30] memory
[75:31] um and of course and that would work
[75:33] here
[75:34] it would it would prevent my exploit
[75:38] what the attacker response is to
[75:41] uh to to to this defense is called
[75:44] return oriented programming and what it
[75:47] does then
[75:48] is that it instead of executing anything
[75:51] it just makes sure to
[75:53] send the program pointer
[75:56] into existing code maybe in
[75:59] the libc or somewhere where there's a
[76:02] lot of code
[76:03] and it finds a little bit of code here
[76:04] and a little bit of code there
[76:06] and it executes that and then it jumps
[76:09] back
[76:09] into the attacker's control and the
[76:11] attacker sends it away to execute
[76:13] another little piece these are called
[76:14] gadgets
[76:15] and i've actually been thinking about is
[76:17] it possible to do return oriented
[76:19] programming
[76:20] on the universal turing machine and i'm
[76:22] not it could be
[76:23] could be that you could actually uh that
[76:26] you could trick the program
[76:28] into executing the universe learning
[76:30] machine into executing
[76:32] program statements from the binary
[76:34] counter and then if you have a longer
[76:36] program than the binary account you will
[76:38] have more to choose from
[76:39] and then return back to the attacker
[76:42] controller and then the attacker could
[76:44] choose
[76:44] which of the statements would be
[76:46] executed uh
[76:48] i tried briefly i have not succeeded
[76:50] with that but
[76:51] maybe it's possible very good very good
[76:54] so i hand back to alex for the
[76:56] next question from the audience thank
[76:59] you okay so i will go
[77:00] to the renzo's remarks and comments on
[77:04] the youtube chat
[77:06] there were about two points about two
[77:08] subjects the first one is maybe the fact
[77:10] that uh
[77:12] the turing machine for regrumming is
[77:14] using metal logic
[77:16] because you have a logic on your system
[77:19] and you have the logic of the
[77:21] behavior of your system so when you mix
[77:23] these two languages maybe
[77:25] this is a well the this is the way that
[77:29] uh weird six
[77:30] happens that says renzo for the fact
[77:33] that we
[77:33] can um we are we cannot we do not read
[77:37] them
[77:37] with the same logic while doing things
[77:40] with the turing machine
[77:41] and one programming it is i will say
[77:44] and another quite interesting attack i
[77:46] think renzo has pointed out
[77:48] which is a link to a question from an
[77:51] anonymous uh
[77:53] visitor i would say our listener
[77:56] is that a denial of services infinite
[77:59] stutter
[78:00] is maybe an uh valid attack and the
[78:02] question was about
[78:03] the fact that uh how do you implement an
[78:06] action that stopped
[78:07] to that's a turing machine
[78:12] so um you can do a denial of service
[78:16] attack right
[78:17] and an infinite stutter that would be if
[78:19] you just have a long list of a's
[78:22] in the input then it would just keep
[78:23] stuttering um
[78:26] but if you could uh bring so this
[78:28] particular
[78:29] binary country doesn't have a halting
[78:31] state if you could bring it to a halting
[78:34] state
[78:38] well if you as an attacker could
[78:41] coerce it into a halting state that
[78:43] would be a a good denial of service
[78:45] attack i suppose
[78:46] but that would depend on the program
[78:48] that is being simulated
[78:50] um so um yeah
[78:56] okay thank you so uh the other questions
[79:00] from
[79:00] martial pilami uh
[79:05] so i will take the one about the
[79:08] latest slides about what does a turing
[79:11] complete
[79:12] mean and how does a cardboard count get
[79:16] card game to beat your incomplete
[79:19] yes actually i haven't read the paper
[79:21] about magic
[79:22] about magic the gathering how that is
[79:24] touring complete but during complete of
[79:26] course
[79:27] it means that that that you can
[79:31] that it is as powerful as a turing
[79:32] machine
[79:34] so magic the gathering if you i guess
[79:38] the way i'm imagining that it works is
[79:40] that you uh
[79:41] move the cards around in a fashion
[79:44] that that uh specified by the rules of
[79:48] the game
[79:49] and if you then interpret the cards in
[79:52] the proper way
[79:54] then you can you can
[79:57] do the same kind of computation that the
[80:00] turing machine can
[80:03] so but uh but i haven't read that paper
[80:05] uh but
[80:06] but actually uh now that you mentioned
[80:09] it maybe i should
[80:11] as far as i remember some news from
[80:13] video games or
[80:15] games uh magazines they created a state
[80:18] of games because it's a multiplayer game
[80:20] when of course uh each actions could be
[80:23] created as a turing machine so the game
[80:25] could play by itself for
[80:27] like making a binary counter something
[80:30] like that
[80:30] by using some characteristics of
[80:32] specific cards and the rules of the game
[80:35] it's very i haven't read it either
[80:40] okay and so i have two more precise
[80:43] questions
[80:45] the first one is more technical but
[80:47] maybe you have answered it during your
[80:48] presentation
[80:49] those your exploits to minsky's
[80:51] universal turing machine allows to
[80:53] execute arbitrary code or only some code
[80:56] a subset of all or unknown arbitrary
[80:59] code so you can
[81:00] so i specif i use this eraser program
[81:03] now it's just
[81:04] simple simple program with two
[81:05] transitions but you can you can have an
[81:08] arbitrary
[81:08] length of the program specification
[81:12] in the exploit so uh that can be
[81:15] uh uh well arbitrary yes so you could so
[81:18] it is arbitrary code execution not
[81:20] just execution of the eraser uh program
[81:23] yes
[81:24] okay thank you and the last question
[81:26] from mars bellamy again
[81:28] i don't know you know what is in his
[81:30] mind
[81:31] what he he has in mind why poor posting
[81:34] it but
[81:34] how did your colleagues react when you
[81:36] told them what you are working on
[81:40] um yes
[81:43] well they reacted uh differently
[81:47] uh some some reacted uh
[81:50] i would say you know with with
[81:54] kind disinterest on interest
[81:58] oh that's interesting they said hacking
[82:01] the universal turing machine
[82:03] okay there was uh
[82:06] some some people who who were quite
[82:09] enthusiastic
[82:10] about it but they were fewer than the
[82:12] ones who
[82:13] who and in particular before before it
[82:15] made the news
[82:16] uh i think it's very difficult you know
[82:19] i'm saying that i'm trying to understand
[82:21] even what i'm talking about
[82:22] uh if i you know in a in a coffee con
[82:26] a conversation by the coffee machine or
[82:28] the virtual coffee machine that's the
[82:29] business i say i'm
[82:30] i'm working on a project where i'm
[82:32] hacking the universal turing machine
[82:34] most people i mean if someone said that
[82:36] to me i wouldn't understand what they
[82:38] meant
[82:39] unless i had you know performed this
[82:41] particular problem
[82:42] you know this exercise so so i think
[82:45] that the reactions are quite
[82:47] natural you have to really think about
[82:50] it
[82:50] before you understand even what it would
[82:52] mean to hack a turning machine
[82:56] okay so thank you for your answers i
[82:58] have no questions left
[83:00] so back to yuma oliver so yeah i have
[83:03] i have a few more questions um
[83:06] the first question is bringing us back a
[83:09] little bit to the initial discussion
[83:10] and the first question that alex was
[83:12] asking towards this
[83:14] teaching so um could
[83:17] or better shoot minsky have
[83:20] foreseen this problem and the question
[83:23] of course is behind this um
[83:25] do we have a does this relate
[83:29] to uh potential fundamental problems in
[83:32] our software engineering or
[83:34] hardware engineering courses that we are
[83:36] teaching at universities and
[83:43] is and also behind like is there enough
[83:46] relevance or importance in the
[83:49] curriculum today
[83:50] for cyber security you know you foresee
[83:52] this to change in the upcoming years
[83:56] well some some different comments on
[84:00] that
[84:02] firstly minsky of course
[84:05] he didn't he he was not interested in
[84:08] security at all when he wrote his book
[84:10] so
[84:11] but uh but then as i said that that it
[84:14] actually
[84:14] that yeah i happen to create a
[84:16] vulnerable machine i think that's quite
[84:17] that's fascinating um
[84:21] i think that in the
[84:24] um i think that it is interesting to
[84:28] have
[84:28] uh i mean that this aspect is a part of
[84:32] uh
[84:33] when you when you read about or learn
[84:35] about you know the minsky implementation
[84:37] of energy it seems to me that this is a
[84:39] quite interesting
[84:40] kind of added dimension to it
[84:44] the extent to which it affects the uh
[84:46] curriculum
[84:47] is so you can have it in the curriculum
[84:48] of uh
[84:52] when you're when you're teaching uh
[84:54] formal languages and automata
[84:56] and turing machines in software
[84:58] engineering
[84:59] i think and in security i think this is
[85:02] a very
[85:04] of course i think this vulnerability has
[85:08] all of the hallmarks of the
[85:10] vulnerabilities
[85:11] that uh uh that we see in real life it's
[85:14] that's that's i think maybe the most
[85:16] surprising to me
[85:17] now post factum uh when i observe this
[85:19] vulnerability that
[85:20] it's very very similar to this the
[85:23] vulnerabilities and it's
[85:25] due to the same reasons and
[85:28] it's very analogous and so that to me
[85:32] seems important that
[85:35] it makes this more important and and
[85:38] perhaps more useful as a as
[85:40] a some uh as a guide to help us think
[85:44] about security
[85:45] uh trying to remove the unnecessary
[85:48] clutter
[85:49] of you know a whole computer with uh
[85:53] with spectre and meltdown
[85:56] vulnerabilities and
[85:57] infinite complexity of hardware and so
[85:59] on
[86:01] so maybe there's there's something there
[86:03] that that can be
[86:04] relevant for for the curriculum when it
[86:07] comes to cyber
[86:09] security for instance so um
[86:13] we are doing a lot of uh books so
[86:16] massive
[86:16] online courses and just hearing what you
[86:19] are talking about and also um
[86:22] from the question around so the the
[86:25] buffer overflow is
[86:26] like kind of the uh
[86:30] like a basic exploit that is used for
[86:33] spawning many different other exploits
[86:35] and that me
[86:36] well i'm just brainstorming a little bit
[86:38] because what i could imagine what could
[86:40] be a really cool mooc
[86:41] would be to start with the turing
[86:43] machine concept introducing that and
[86:45] then afterwards doing your buffer
[86:46] overflow and then introducing other
[86:48] concepts like ransomware so imagine you
[86:50] have the abandoned
[86:51] of the machine and then it's writing
[86:53] okay please send bitcoins to something
[86:55] this this would be really cool like from
[86:58] a teaching perspective so i think
[87:00] people would really love that
[87:03] i think there are many things i mean of
[87:04] course it is of course the case that you
[87:07] can implement everything on
[87:08] the third machine but uh there's another
[87:10] thing i've been thinking about is that
[87:12] one thing that is not captured in this
[87:15] is
[87:16] uh the issue of uh access control
[87:20] that uh which is so fundamental in
[87:24] in computer security that there are some
[87:26] things which should be allowed and some
[87:27] things which should not be allowed
[87:30] and so gaining arbitrary code execution
[87:32] is not the same thing i mean
[87:34] you it's not the same thing as root
[87:36] access to a machine
[87:38] because arbitrary code execution you can
[87:39] have that in the browser and you're
[87:41] supposed to have it as a server in the
[87:42] browser even
[87:44] but that's not uh god mode a god mode is
[87:48] root
[87:49] and so yeah but it seems it would also
[87:52] be possible to
[87:53] incorporate quite simply perhaps even
[87:56] access control in this very very simple
[87:58] computer you could have multiple tapes
[88:00] for instance and
[88:01] one type is for where you can
[88:05] for for doing uh the the privileged
[88:08] stuff
[88:08] and then the question is whether you can
[88:10] escalate by if you can have
[88:12] access to um
[88:15] one tape can you then gain access to the
[88:18] other tape so
[88:20] but i mean of course it it
[88:23] should be possible to simulate
[88:25] everything on a touring machine so
[88:26] it's not surprising really that you
[88:28] could have you know
[88:30] arbitrary complexity of vulnerabilities
[88:33] and so on
[88:34] but if it really becomes more
[88:35] pedagogical that's the question perhaps
[88:38] yeah yeah so if you ever think about
[88:41] doing it
[88:42] i'll i would be happy to collaborate
[88:44] with you on it because i i could really
[88:45] think that this
[88:46] is like a different access to the matter
[88:49] that we are teaching on everyday basis
[88:52] because
[88:53] when i tell someone okay this is
[88:55] ransomware this is a buffer overflow
[88:57] it's kind of an abstract concept
[88:58] because it's always like yeah okay so
[89:01] you can override the memory
[89:02] and to do it it's quite complex and the
[89:05] other thing
[89:05] is really like the easy machine
[89:09] and you can really explore the things so
[89:12] yeah
[89:12] great cool um as you're also a cyber
[89:15] security researcher
[89:17] um and this also is cyber security but
[89:20] you said also you do
[89:21] other stuff i will have to ask you also
[89:23] the obligatory question that i always
[89:25] have for the experts
[89:26] so what would you say is the biggest
[89:28] cyber security threat that we have today
[89:31] the biggest cyber security threat yes
[89:34] well
[89:36] well i think that the biggest problem
[89:38] that we have is that we
[89:40] that we are unable to build secure uh
[89:43] computer systems
[89:45] uh it seems completely impossible for us
[89:48] to do that
[89:49] even the most you know the most critical
[89:51] issues
[89:52] uh are uh those critical functions
[89:56] they we discover vulnerabilities you
[89:58] know in crypto libraries you should not
[90:00] have vulnerabilities in crypto libraries
[90:02] and people are really trying to not
[90:04] have that but we do in operating systems
[90:07] that you know on which life depends
[90:09] you should not have critical
[90:11] vulnerabilities but we have them monthly
[90:12] and you know by the dozens um and
[90:16] and we
[90:19] have even started reading uh uh reports
[90:22] that
[90:23] that there is worry about the cyber
[90:25] threat to nuclear
[90:27] uh weapon systems it seems to me that
[90:31] we should those systems should be secure
[90:33] at least
[90:34] of all the systems but no it doesn't
[90:36] seem that they are either so
[90:38] because we're fundamentally uh not
[90:40] capable of building secure systems
[90:42] and that's to me uh that's the big risk
[90:45] combined of course
[90:46] with i mean the immense uh utility
[90:49] of of uh of computers and this
[90:52] fan that the universal machine a machine
[90:55] that can do anything
[90:56] it turns out to be super useful and
[90:59] and that means that we are digitizing
[91:02] everything that we can
[91:03] at astounding pace we're turning over
[91:07] everything that we can to the computers
[91:10] and we we leave it to their custody all
[91:12] you know the global financial system
[91:14] critical infrastructure society our
[91:17] lives when we let them drive our
[91:19] driverless or even current day cars
[91:23] medical machinery everything so
[91:27] so i say that that's that's uh those are
[91:30] the two things maybe
[91:32] that the turing machine is uh or that
[91:34] the the computers
[91:36] seem so hard to build securely or
[91:37] computer programs and that
[91:39] but at the same time are so very very
[91:43] uh useful very good and
[91:46] that's also a very good uh closing
[91:48] remark because it uh
[91:49] shows that our series is super important
[91:51] because there's so much more to explore
[91:53] and there's so much awareness to rise
[91:55] and i want to say thank you
[91:57] once again so much for the talk because
[92:00] it was
[92:01] it was rising the awareness and it was
[92:03] uh on the one hand um
[92:05] super philosophical and uh like away
[92:08] from the
[92:09] basics because there was so many
[92:10] concepts that we've seen and on the
[92:12] other hand
[92:12] everybody could follow it either during
[92:16] the talk if you ever
[92:17] worked with a turing machine or if not
[92:18] you can just follow the links that
[92:20] fundus was using and then you can
[92:22] replicate what he was doing on life and
[92:24] so
[92:24] yeah we we call you they invite you to
[92:26] do this after the talk
[92:28] so yeah thank you very much i uh clap my
[92:30] hands uh once again
[92:32] uh for for this great talk so thank you
[92:35] very much for that
[92:36] um for all the people and the and also
[92:39] thank you of course
[92:40] to the teams or to alex lorenzo to
[92:42] olivia
[92:43] that did the uh back office work uh
[92:46] today with the year chats and the
[92:48] communication
[92:50] um if you didn't subscribe to the
[92:52] channel yet
[92:54] please do so you can also subscribe on
[92:56] the website to receive always the
[92:57] announcements uh
[92:59] the next edition will be as usual on the
[93:01] last wednesday of the month
[93:03] at five o'clock central european time so
[93:06] the next talk will be by michelle
[93:08] pablo and he will tell us something
[93:10] about
[93:11] quantum computing those in the stream
[93:14] the trailer will uh
[93:15] show up next so we hope to see you again
[93:19] um in about two weeks for the regular
[93:22] edition
[93:22] at the 30th of june at five o'clock
[93:26] thank you very much have a great evening
[93:28] and subscribe to the newsletters
[93:30] and the channel a growing issue is the
[93:33] security of communication in general and
[93:37] one of the threat right now is quantum
[93:39] computing

A computer science professor from Sweden has discovered an arbitrary code execution vuln in the Universal Turing Machine, one of the earliest computer designs in history – though he admits it has "no real-world implications".

In a paper published on academic repository ArXiv, Pontus Johnson, a professor at the KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Stockholm, Sweden, cheerfully explained that his findings wouldn't be exploitable in a real-world scenario because it pertained specifically to the 1967 implementation [[PDF](https://regmedia.co.uk/2021/05/10/mit_minsky_paper.pdf)] of the simulated Universal Turing Machine (UTM) designed by [the late Marvin Minsky](https://www.theregister.com/2016/01/26/marvin_minsky_obit/), who co-founded the academic discipline of artificial intelligence.

Yet what the amusing little caper really brings to the world is a philosophical point: if one of the simplest concepts of a computer is vulnerable to user meddling, where in the design process should we start trying to implement security features?

"The universal Turing machine is generally considered to be the simplest, most abstract model of a computer," wrote Johnson [in his paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2105.02124). Through exploiting the Minsky-spec UTM's lack of input validation, he was able to trick it into running a program he had put together.

The Minsky specification describes a tape-based machine that reads and executes very simple programs from a simulated tape. Instructions on the tape move the simulated tape reader head left or right across the "tape" itself, which is represented as a one-line alphanumeric string. While users can make inputs at the start of the tape, in the UTM model they're not supposed to alter the program that follows.

"Regardless of the historical aspect of it, the fact [is] that the most simple [computer] we can describe seems to have had this propensity for vulnerability," Johnson told *The Register*.

[![](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/ad?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z4giVheb0I4Tip_FruAalAAAAA0&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D426raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)](https://pubads.g.doubleclick.net/gampad/jump?co=1&iu=/6978/reg_security/front&sz=300x50%7C300x100%7C300x250%7C300x251%7C300x252%7C300x600%7C300x601&tile=4&c=44Z4giVheb0I4Tip_FruAalAAAAA0&t=ct%3Dns%26unitnum%3D4%26raptor%3Dfalcon%26pos%3Dmid%26test%3D0)

Security (if you could call it that) for UTM consists of a single digit that tells the machine "user input ends here, everything after this point is executable with the parameters you've just read."

Johnson's exploit was as simple as writing that "input ends here" character in the user input field and then writing his own program after it. The UTM executes that and skips past the intended program.

Parallels with modern vulnerabilities are obvious: scale it up a bit in complexity and this has all the hallmarks of a SQL injection vuln, for example – or any other unsanitised or unescaped user input field.

Johnson told *The Register* today: "In this case, as in many cases, the vulnerability is based on confusing the machine… in academia, we scientists like to start with the basic principle: demonstrate something for a small system, then maybe it's true for a larger system. It seems to me that for the very smallest system, there is this intrinsic vulnerability, this propensity to be vulnerable."

The compsci prof continued: "Obviously Marvin Minsky didn't have the intention to [create] either a secure or a vulnerable system. Nevertheless, what happened was [it] was vulnerable."

Philosophically, Johnson's vuln (which has been assigned as [CVE-2021-32471](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32471)) raises deeper questions for hardware and firmware designers alike to think upon, he told us: "Some people say that security needs to be built in from the start; you can't add it later. But in this case, all the mitigations of this that I could think of, they need to be add-ons, you can't build it into this machine.

"And if this is the mother of all computers, then it seems to me that you cannot build security in from the start."

Professor Alan Woodward of the University of Surrey opined to *El Reg*: "It's an interesting and provocative thought as to whether or not there is some fundamental cause for the number of specific attacks we see. I don't think we need to panic that there is some fundamental flaw in modern computer architecture, more it's a reminder that complexity brings its own threats."

Looking specifically at Johnson's vuln, he commented: "Interestingly, it seems to point more to issues with interpretations/implementations of the Turing machine. It seems to support the adage that nothing is totally secure once it's actually implemented." ®
