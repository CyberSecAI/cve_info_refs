The document describes multiple vulnerabilities affecting the SuiteLink Server component in various AVEVA products.

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**
*   **CWE-122: Heap-Based Buffer Overflow:** A heap-based buffer overflow occurs while parsing malicious packets.
*   **CWE-476: Null Pointer Dereference:** A null pointer dereference can occur.
*   **CWE-755: Improper Handling of Exceptional Conditions:** Improper handling of exceptional conditions leads to crashes.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the SuiteLink Server while processing network packets.
*   Null pointer dereference vulnerability in the SuiteLink Server.
*   Improper handling of exceptional conditions leading to denial of service.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** Exploiting these vulnerabilities can cause the SuiteLink Server to crash, leading to a denial-of-service condition.
*   **Theoretical Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability *theoretically* allows for remote code execution, although no proof-of-concept exists.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Network-based attacks by sending malicious packets to the SuiteLink Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   Network access to the vulnerable SuiteLink Server is required.
*   No specific user privileges are needed, as the vulnerabilities can be exploited remotely without authentication.

**Affected Products:**

*   AVEVA™ System Platform 2020 R2 P01 and all prior versions
*   AVEVA™ InTouch 2020 R2 P01 and all prior versions
