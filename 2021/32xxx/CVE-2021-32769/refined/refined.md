Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32769:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the `DefaultFileSystemResourceLoader` in Micronaut not properly restricting file access to the configured paths for static resources. It allows path traversal using `../` in URLs, enabling access to files outside the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal (CWE-22):** The primary vulnerability is the lack of proper input sanitization, allowing attackers to manipulate file paths to access arbitrary files on the server's filesystem.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** Successful exploitation could lead to the exposure of sensitive files from the server, potentially including configuration files, application code, and other data not intended for public access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **URL Manipulation:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs containing `../` sequences to traverse directories and access unauthorized files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Micronaut application.
*   **No Authentication Required:** No specific privileges or user interaction are needed to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Knowledge of Target System:** The attacker needs to know the application's configuration for static resource serving, which could be obtained through public documentation or by other reconnaissance means.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Micronaut versions prior to 2.5.9 are affected.
*   **Patch:** The fix involves adding checks in `DefaultFileSystemResourceLoader` to prevent access to files outside of the configured base directory. The patch also includes changes to the `DefaultClassPathResourceLoader` to prevent relative path traversal as well.
*   **Workarounds:**
    *   Avoid using `**` in mappings, use only `*` to prevent directory traversal.
    *   Run Micronaut in a chroot environment (Linux only) to limit access to the file system.

**CVSS v3 Metrics:**

*   **CVSS Score:** 7.5 (High)
*   **Attack Vector (AV):** Network (N)
*   **Attack Complexity (AC):** Low (L)
*   **Privileges Required (PR):** None (N)
*   **User Interaction (UI):** None (N)
*   **Scope (S):** Unchanged (U)
*   **Confidentiality (C):** High (H)
*   **Integrity (I):** None (N)
*   **Availability (A):** None (N)
