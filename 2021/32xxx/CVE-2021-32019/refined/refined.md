Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of input validation for hostnames displayed in the OpenWrt LuCI web interface. This missing validation allows for the injection of malicious code via crafted hostnames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. Malicious JavaScript can be injected into the hostname field and executed within the user's browser when viewing the "Connection status" page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full System Control:** Successful exploitation of this XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain complete control over the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack is triggered when a user visits the LuCI “Connection status” page of the router with hostname resolution enabled.
- The attacker needs to establish a network connection with the OpenWrt router which results in their controlled hostname being displayed in the web interface. This can be achieved, for example, by sending ICMP *ping* messages to the router.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network traffic to the OpenWrt router, typically by being on the same network or having some level of network access to the target router.
- The attacker has to craft a malicious hostname which contains XSS code.
- The attacker does not need to authenticate, as the displayed hostnames are received from external sources.

**Affected Versions:**
- OpenWrt versions 19.07.0 to 19.07.7 are confirmed to be affected.

**Mitigation:**
- The vulnerability is addressed in the upcoming OpenWrt 19.07.8 and OpenWrt 21.02.0 releases. Patches are available for the master, 21.02 and 19.07 branches on GitHub, as listed in the references section.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions that older versions of OpenWrt are end of life and are not supported anymore.
- The vulnerability is related to the handling of hostnames in the LuCI web interface, specifically in the "Connection status" page when host name resolution is activated.
- This vulnerability was identified by Philipp Jeitner and Haya Shulman from Fraunhofer SIT.
