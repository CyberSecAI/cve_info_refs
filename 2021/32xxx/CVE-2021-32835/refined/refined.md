The provided content describes **CVE-2021-32834**, not CVE-2021-32835.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The application allows users to create Policy Sets which include Groovy scripts. These scripts are evaluated, leading to arbitrary code execution.
- The Groovy sandbox implementation is insufficient to prevent code execution using meta-programming techniques.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Arbitrary Groovy script evaluation:** The application directly evaluates Groovy expressions provided by the user, which can contain arbitrary code.
- **Groovy sandbox escape:** The sandbox implemented using SecureASTCustomizer and GroovySecureExtension can be bypassed using Groovy meta-programming features like `@ASTTest` annotation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker sends a malicious Policy Set containing a Groovy script that exploits the meta-programming bypass.
- The malicious script is embedded in the `conditions` part of the policy definition.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create Policy Sets, implying they would need to have a valid account with the required privileges.
- The attacker needs to send an HTTP request to the `/v1/policy-set/default` endpoint with the malicious JSON payload.
