  "CVE-2021-32627": {
    "description": "Integer to heap buffer overflow issue with streams, when configuring a non-default, large value for proto-max-bulk-len and client-query-buffer-limit",
    "root_cause": "An integer overflow vulnerability exists in Redis when handling stream data, specifically when the `proto-max-bulk-len` and `client-query-buffer-limit` configuration parameters are set to large, non-default values.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Integer Overflow",
      "Heap buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "Heap corruption and potential remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send specially crafted stream elements, and the Redis configuration needs to have the `proto-max-bulk-len` and `client-query-buffer-limit` parameters set to large, non-default values. Additionally, an unprivileged user who has the ability to modify redis configurations using the CONFIG command would be able to cause this vulnerability, unless ACL is set to restrict use of this command."
