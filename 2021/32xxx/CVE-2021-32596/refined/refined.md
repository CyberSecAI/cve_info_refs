Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of a predictable salt and a digest-based algorithm for password hashing in FortiPortal. Specifically, the salt used was not sufficiently random or unique.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **CWE-760:** Use of a one-way hash with a predictable salt. The use of a predictable salt makes the password hashes susceptible to precomputed attacks such as rainbow table lookups.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who has already obtained the password database can use precomputed tables to decrypt stored passwords. This leads to information disclosure.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attacker must have access to the password store. This implies the attacker already needs to have compromised the system to some extent.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires access to the database containing the password hashes. This access is privileged as it would require some level of administrative access to the system.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to utilize precomputed tables to crack the password hashes.

**Summary of Vulnerability:**

FortiPortal versions 6.0.4 and below use a predictable salt when hashing passwords, making it vulnerable to attacks that use precomputed tables. This vulnerability can lead to information disclosure if an attacker gains access to the password hashes.
