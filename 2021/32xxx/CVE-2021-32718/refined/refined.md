Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32718:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the RabbitMQ management UI not properly sanitizing user input when rendering a confirmation message after a new user is added. Specifically, the username was not escaped before being displayed in a pop-up message.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a basic XSS, specifically, improper neutralization of script-related HTML tags. The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code via a crafted username.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable web page.
- **Potentially Malicious Actions:** This could lead to various malicious activities, such as:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
    - Modifying the appearance of the web page.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Management UI:** The attack vector is through the RabbitMQ management UI.
- **User Creation:** The vulnerability is triggered when a new user is created via the UI, and the username is displayed in the confirmation message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Elevated Permissions:** The attacker must have the necessary elevated permissions to create new users. This means the attacker needs to be logged in as an administrator or a user with similar privileges within the RabbitMQ management UI.
- **User Interaction:** Although it's not user interaction in the way that an user has to click a link, the attack requires user interaction in the sense that the attacker needs to create a new user using the management UI.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was responsibly disclosed by Christian Rellmann from usd AG.
- The vulnerability was fixed in RabbitMQ version 3.8.17.
- The vulnerability is rated as low severity.
- The CVSS v3 score is 3.1 (SUSE) and 5.4 (NVD) with differences in Attack Complexity and Privileges Required.
- The vulnerability is tracked under CWE-80 (Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS)).
- Workaround: The `rabbitmq_management` plugin should be disabled and CLI tools should be used for management operations, while Prometheus and Grafana should be used for metrics and monitoring.
