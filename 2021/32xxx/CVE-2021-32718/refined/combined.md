# Improper Neutralization of Script-Related HTML Tags in a Web Page (Basic XSS) in RabbitMQ management UI

Low

[michaelklishin](/michaelklishin)
published
GHSA-c3hj-rg5h-2772
Jun 27, 2021

## Package

rabbitmq-server

## Affected versions

< 3.8.17

## Patched versions

3.8.17

## Description

Our team would like to thank Christian Rellmann from [usd AG](https://www.usd.de/) for [responsibly disclosing](https://www.rabbitmq.com/contact.html#security)

the vulnerability and helping us verify a fix.

### Impact

When a new user was added via management UI, its name was rendered in a confirmation

message without proper `<script>` tag sanitization, potentially allowing for JavaScript code

execution in the context of the page.

The user must be signed in and have elevated permissions (other user management).

### Patches

* The vulnerability is patched in RabbitMQ `3.8.17` or a later version.
* [rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server#3028](https://github.com/rabbitmq/rabbitmq-server/pull/3028)

### Workarounds

Disable `rabbitmq_management` plugin and use [CLI tools](https://www.rabbitmq.com/cli.html) for management operations

and [Prometheus and Grafana](https://www.rabbitmq.com/prometheus.html) for metrics and monitoring.

### References

None.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory, please contact `security@rabbitmq.com`.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# CVE-2021-32718

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2021-32715.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2021-32719.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-32718 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32718)

#### Description

RabbitMQ is a multi-protocol messaging broker. In rabbitmq-server prior to version 3.8.17, a new user being added via management UI could lead to the user's bane being rendered in a confirmation message without proper `<script>` tag sanitization, potentially allowing for JavaScript code execution in the context of the page. In order for this to occur, the user must be signed in and have elevated permissions (other user management). The vulnerability is patched in RabbitMQ 3.8.17. As a workaround, disable `rabbitmq\_management` plugin and use CLI tools for management operations and Prometheus and Grafana for metrics and monitoring.

usd-2021-0032 | SUSE CVE Database (suse.com)

============================================

Advisory ID: usd-2021-0032

Affected Product: SUSE CVE database

Vulnerability Type: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page
Generation (,Cross-site Scripting')

Security Risk: High

Vendor URL:  <<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/>>
<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/>

Vendor Status: Fixed

Suse's CVE database embedded third-party contents without sufficient
filtering and/or encoding. Multiple incidents have been identified where
Suse embedded untrusted <script> tags, resulting in stored
Cross-Site-Scripting (XSS).

Proof of Concept (PoC)

======================

In order to exploit the vulnerability, a new CVE record must be published
officially. This CVE record can contain arbitrary text as a "description".
Here, JavaScript code can injected. The SUSE CVE database imports this data
automatically and displays the information on a website. The injected code
will be executed automatically.

An example CVE containing an HTML <script> tag is CVE-2021-32718 (
<<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32718.html>>
<https://www.suse.com/security/cve/CVE-2021-32718.html>). Here, the HTML tag
was interpreted and potentially malicious JavaScript code which could follow
here would have been executed.

The following screenshots illustrate that the <script> tag was embedded
without any encoding or filtering and interpreted as markup by the browser
accordingly:

===========================================

Advisory ID: usd20210006

Affected Product: ChronoEngine ChronoForms v7

Affected Version: v7.0.7

Vulnerability Type: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a
Restricted Directory (,Path Traversal')

Security Risk: Medium

Vendor URL:  <<https://www.chronoengine.com/chronoforms>>
<https://www.chronoengine.com/chronoforms>

Vendor Status: Unknown

The ChronoForms function to download form input logs is vulnerable through
path traversal attacks. This allows an attacker with administration
permissions to download arbitrary files from web servers filesystem.

The parameter `fname` passed to the log script in the Joomla administration
interface is not filtered for path traversal. This allows an attacker with
administration permissions to download arbitrary files from the web servers
filesystem, like for instance Joomla's configuration file containing secret
credentials.

Proof of Concept (PoC)

======================

Open the vulnerable file in a Webbrowser:
<<https://%3cJoomlaInstallation%3e/administrator/index.php?option=com_chronof>
orms7&cont=logs&act=file&fname=%3clocal_file>
https://<JoomlaInstallation>/administrator/index.php?option=com_chronoforms7
&cont=logs&act=file&fname=<local_file>

Examples:

* /etc/passwd:
<<https://herolab.usd.de/wp-content/uploads/sites/9/2021/11/usd20210006-1-red>

Vulnerability Type: CWE-22: Improper Limitation of a Pathname to a
Restricted Directory (,Path Traversal')

Security Risk: High

Vendor URL:  <<https://www.chronoengine.com/chronoforums>>
<https://www.chronoengine.com/chronoforums>

Vendor Status: Unknown

The ChronoForums avatar function is vulnerable through unauthenticated path
traversal attacks. This enables unauthenticated attackers to read arbitrary
files, like for instance Joomla's configuration file containing secret
credentials.

The ChronoForums avatar function is vulnerable through path traversal
attacks. An attacker can pass arbitrary local file paths as 'av' parameter.
The content of the file is returned. Unauthenticated attackers could use
this vulnerability to read arbitrary files, like for instance Joomla's
configuration file containing secret credentials.

Proof of Concept (PoC)

======================

Open the vulnerable file in a webbrowser:
<<https://%3cJoomlaInstallation%3e/index.php/component/chronoforums2/profiles>
/avatar/u1?tvout=file&av=%3clocal_file>
https://<JoomlaInstallation>/index.php/component/chronoforums2/profiles/avat
ar/u1?tvout=file&av=<local_file>

Examples:

usd-2020-0106 (CVE-2021-25273) | Sophos UTM

===========================================

Advisory ID: usd-2020-0106

CWE ID: CVE-2021-25273

Affected Product: Sophos UTM

Affected Version: < UTM 9.706

Vulnerability Type: CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page
Generation (,Cross-site Scripting')

Security Risk: Medium

Vendor URL:  <<https://sophos.com>> <https://sophos.com>

Vendor Status: Fixed

Sophos UTM offers a web interface to manage quarantined mails. The web-based
interface did not filter user controlled inputs sufficiently, resulting in
multiple Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. Sophos UTM is a
firewall solution by Sophos. It implements a web interface that allows
authenticated users to manage quarantined mails. Additionally, users can
inspect the contents of mails.

Sophos UTM failed to sanitize the following contents of mails before
reflecting them within the web interface:

* subject

* filename(s) of attached file(s)

* sender's name

* mail body (actual contents)

Proof of Concept (PoC)

======================

1. Send an e-mail that purposely is sent to quarantine by Sophos UTM. This
can be for instance achieved by including the "Generic Test for Unsolicited
Bulk Email" (GTUBE) test string. Additionally, include the following markup:

```

<iframe src="asd">

<img src="x:gif" onerror="alert('asd')"></img>

```

2. Access the SMTP quarantine interface and display the detail view of the
previously sent e-mail.

3. Observe that the XSS payload is executed within Sophos UTM's origin.
