  "CVE-2021-32628": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "Integer overflow in ziplist data structure.",
    "details": "An integer overflow vulnerability exists in the ziplist data structure of Redis. This can be triggered by configuring large, non-default values for `hash-max-ziplist-entries`, `hash-max-ziplist-value`, `zset-max-ziplist-entries` or `zset-max-ziplist-value`. Specially crafted commands can then create very large ziplists, leading to heap corruption and potentially remote code execution.",
    "affected_versions": [
      "Redis versions prior to 5.0.14",
      "Redis versions prior to 6.0.16",
      "Redis versions prior to 6.2.6"
    ],
    "impact": "Heap corruption and potentially remote code execution.",
    "attack_vector": "Network. Requires sending specially crafted commands after reconfiguring ziplist options.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "Low-privilege access with the ability to modify the mentioned Redis configurations, requiring network access."
