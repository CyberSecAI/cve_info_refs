- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application's trailing slash redirection feature can be exploited.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Open Redirect vulnerability (CWE-601). The application improperly handles URLs with trailing slashes, allowing an attacker to redirect users to an untrusted site. Specifically, the vulnerability stems from how the application handles sequential forward slashes in the URL path in combination with a trailing slash.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can craft phishing links and other open redirects, potentially leading users to malicious websites.
- **Attack vectors:** Attackers can craft malicious URLs that include pairs of forward slashes in sequence along with a trailing slash. For example, `https://example.com//foo/`
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and trick a user into clicking on it.
