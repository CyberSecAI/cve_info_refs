**Root Cause:** The Horner Automation Cscape application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files.

**Vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125).

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vector:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted project file. This suggests a local attack vector where the attacker must get the user to open a malicious project file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted project file to a user of the affected Cscape application. The attacker does not require any special privileges but needs to have the user open the malicious file.

**Additional Notes:**
