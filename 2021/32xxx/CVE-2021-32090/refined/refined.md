Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32090:

**Vulnerability:** OS Command Injection

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from the insecure construction of a system command using user-controlled input (`func_name`) within the `localstack/dashboard/infra.py` file. Specifically, the `get_lambda_code` function takes user input and directly embeds it into a shell command using string formatting without sanitization. This command is then executed via `subprocess.check_output()` with `shell=True`, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-   **Unsanitized Input:** The application fails to sanitize user-provided input before incorporating it into a system command.
-   **Use of `shell=True`:**  Employing `shell=True` in `subprocess.check_output()` makes the system vulnerable to shell injection attacks because the input is interpreted by the shell, enabling an attacker to execute arbitrary commands.
-   **Lack of Input Validation**: The application does not validate or sanitize the `func_name` parameter passed through the URL, which allows an attacker to inject malicious command fragments.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Arbitrary Command Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system with the privileges of the LocalStack process.
-   **System Compromise:** Depending on the privileges of the process, attackers can potentially compromise the entire system.
-   **Data exfiltration/modification**: Attackers could download or modify data, send malware, stop services or exhaust resources, potentially leading to a denial of service.
-   **Privilege Escalation and Lateral Movement:** Attackers can escalate their privileges and attack other servers in the network, especially if misconfigurations are present in the infrastructure, such as in Docker/Kubernetes clusters, cloud services, firewalls, and OS access control settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Remote via chained vulnerabilities:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by chaining it with a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) and Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities. The attacker lures a victim to a malicious website that sends HTTP requests to the vulnerable local LocalStack instance.
-   **Direct access (less likely):**  Although less likely, if the LocalStack instance is directly exposed, it could be exploited directly, without chaining vulnerabilities.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  **Ability to induce a user to visit a malicious webpage:**  The attacker needs to trick a user into visiting a malicious website that will trigger the requests against the LocalStack instance.
-  **Network access**: The attacker does not need to be on the same network as the LocalStack instance but does need the user to have network connectivity to the local network where the LocalStack instance runs

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided content describes a chain of vulnerabilities, starting with CSRF, leading to SSRF and XSS, culminating in the Command Injection.
- The vulnerability was reported to the vendor, but the vendor considered the risk low due to the local nature of LocalStack instances.
- The content also indicates that the LocalStack application does not use authentication.
- The vulnerability is identified as rule `S5334` by SonarSource.
