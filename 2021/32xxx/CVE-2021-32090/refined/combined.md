* [injection](/python/tag/injection/RSPEC-2076/)

## Why is this an issue?

## How can I fix it?

## More Info

OS command injections occur when applications build command lines from untrusted data before executing them with a system shell.
 In that case,
an attacker can tamper with the command line construction and force the execution of unexpected commands. This can lead to the compromise of the
underlying operating system.

### What is the potential impact?

An attacker exploiting an OS command injection vulnerability will be able to execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system.

The impact depends on the access control measures taken on the target system OS. In the worst-case scenario, the process runs with root privileges,
and therefore any OS commands or programs may be affected.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

#### Denial of service and data leaks

In this scenario, the attack aims to disrupt the organization’s activities and profit from data leaks.

An attacker could, for example:

* download the internal server’s data, most likely to sell it
* modify data, send malware
* stop services or exhaust resources (with fork bombs for example)

This threat is particularly insidious if the attacked organization does not maintain a disaster recovery plan (DRP).

#### Root privilege escalation and pivot

In this scenario, the attacker can do everything described in the previous section. The difference is that the attacker also manages to elevate
their privileges to an administrative level and attacks other servers.

Here, the impact depends on how much the target company focuses on its Defense In Depth. For example, the entire infrastructure can be compromised
by a combination of OS injections and **misconfiguration** of:

* Docker or Kubernetes clusters
* cloud services
* network firewalls and routing
* OS access control

## Why is this an issue?

## How can I fix it?

## More Info

Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) occurs when attackers can coerce a server to perform arbitrary requests on their behalf.

An SSRF vulnerability can either be basic or blind, depending on whether the server’s fetched data is directly returned in the web application’s
response.
 The absence of the corresponding response for the coerced request on the application is not a barrier to exploitation and thus must be
treated in the same way as basic SSRF.

### What is the potential impact?

SSRF usually results in unauthorized actions or data disclosure in the vulnerable application or on a different system it can reach. Conditional to
what is reachable, remote command execution can be achieved, although it often requires chaining with further exploitations.

Information disclosure is SSRF’s core outcome. Depending on the extracted data, an attacker can perform a variety of different actions that can
range from low to critical severity.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

#### Local file read to host takeover

An attacker manipulates an application into performing a local request for a sensitive file, such as `~/.ssh/id_rsa`, by using the File
URI scheme `file://`.
 Once in possession of the SSH keys, the attacker establishes a remote connection to the system hosting the web
application.

#### Internal Network Reconnaissance

An attacker enumerates internal accessible ports from the affected server or others to which the server can communicate by iterating over the port
field in the URL `http://127.0.0.1:{port}`.
 Taking advantage of other supported URL schemas (dependent on the affected system), for
example, `gopher://127.0.0.1:3306`, an attacker would be able to connect to a database service and perform queries on it.

Project maintainers reportedly declined to fix flaws due to limited attack scenarios

![Zero-day vulnerabilities in LocalStack cloud application framework chained to achieve remote takeover of local instances](/cms/images/ce/8b/3ba5-article-210315-localstack-body-text.jpg "Image: KLSS / Shutterstock")

Critical vulnerabilities in LocalStack, a popular framework for building cloud applications, can be chained to remotely take over locally-run LocalStack instances, security researchers claim.

Researchers from Sonarsource have documented how they combined [cross-site scripting](/web-security/cross-site-scripting) ([XSS](/web-security/cross-site-scripting)) and [server-side request forgery](/web-security/ssrf) ([SSRF](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/ssrf)) vulnerabilities to achieve [OS command injection](/web-security/os-command-injection) against the open source Python application.

However, the vulnerabilities remain unpatched in subsequently released LocalStack versions – v0.12.6 and v0.12.7 – after the project maintainers determined that real-world attack scenarios were “limited”, Sonarsource researcher Dennis Brinkrolf said in a [blog post](https://blog.sonarsource.com/hack-the-stack-with-localstack) published on March 2.

### Attacking the Stack

Researchers observed that LocalStack lacked authentication, probably because the software is “run locally or in a Docker environment, as recommended by the vendor” and therefore not directly exposed to the internet, suggested Brinkrolf.

“However, it is a common fallacy that this type of application cannot be attacked” by external actors, he added, citing how so-called ‘[drive-by pharming attacks](https://www.techopedia.com/definition/15800/drive-by-pharming)’ have previously compromised network routers via their web interface.

[Read more of the latest cloud security news](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cloud-security)

Citing a Sonarsource video demonstrating the LocalStack attack, Johannes Dahse, head of R&D at the [Swiss](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/switzerland) infosec firm, told The Daily Swig: “All it takes is to host a malicious website, for example with interesting content related to LocalStack.

“If an attacker is motivated to target a LocalStack developer, we think that she/he will likely succeed.”

LocalStack’s project maintainers have yet to respond to questions emailed to them by The Daily Swig, but we will update the article should we receive a response.

### CORS for concern

[LocalStack](https://github.com/localstack/localstack) is used to set up AWS cloud environments within local networks in order to develop and test cloud and serverless apps.

The researchers found that remote attackers could interact with locally-running LocalStack instances through the victim’s browser, which they might use to read documentation, suggested Brinkrolf.

“When this victim visits (or is lured to) a malicious/infected website controlled by an attacker, it is possible to trigger cross-site HTTP requests to the victim’s local network via JavaScript code.”

Although this means “an attacker can send arbitrary requests from a website to a LocalStack instance”, the [cross-origin resource sharing](/web-security/cors) ([CORS](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/google-unveils-raft-of-security-improvements-for-chrome-83)) mechanism deployed by popular browsers blocks it from reading the responses, said the researcher.

[Catch up on the latest security vulnerability news](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerabilities)

However, sending the attack payload blindly can still be “sufficient to carry out a successful attack via” cross-site request forgery (CSRF) techniques.

“Moreover, LocalStack explicitly allows the execution of cross-origin requests through any page by setting special HTTP headers in the response,” continued Brinkrolf.

“This means that the attacker can detect and attack a LocalStack instance through the XHR response and does not actually operate blindly.”

Although leading browsers have recently tightened CORS restrictions “to reduce the potential of CSRF attacks”, these were bypassed by an [XSS](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/xss) vulnerability uncovered by the researchers.

### MitM backdoor

The CSRF payload can also reconfigure the edge router that relays requests to LocalStack APIs and add a proxy “that points to an attacker-controlled IP as proxy host”, leading to a persistent SSRF vulnerability.

Because “the server copies the entire HTTP request from the client and forwards it to the server”, the client’s HTTP headers – including the AWS [Cloud](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/cloud-security) authorization header – are then “sent to the attacker-controlled server”, paving the way to “session hijacking and stealing sensitive data from the test cloud”.

And since the SSRF request’s HTTP response “is printed unsanitized in LocalStack”, an XSS payload from the attacker’s server leads to a persistent manipulator-in-the-middle (MitM) proxy that “enables abuse of further features” and the potential “to trigger other code vulnerabilities” – including the command injection vulnerability outlined in Brinkrolf’s blog post.

The researchers say they also uncovered a regular expression denial-of-service ([ReDoS](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/regexploit-tool-unveiled-with-a-raft-of-redos-bugs-already-on-its-resume)) bug in the platform.

### Real-world threat?

Brinkrolf said Sonarsource first notified LocalStack maintainers of the vulnerabilities in October 2020 and contacted them on a further two occasions, before a response arrived in January indicating that the maintainers saw the application’s local execution as a significant barrier to exploitation.

“While we agree that real-world attacks against local instances are less likely than against directly exposed applications, we believe that developers should be aware of these risks in order to protect their setups,” said Brinkrolf.

Johannes Dahse added: “In order to keep the attack surface as small as possible we believe all code vulnerabilities should be addressed.”

LocalStack is a popular open source application that provides an easy-to-use test framework for cloud applications. It enables you to host a fully functional AWS cloud setup in your local network for developing and testing cloud and serverless apps. According to GitHub, it is one of the most popular open source Python applications.

During our security research into modern applications, we discovered critical code vulnerabilities in the latest LocalStack version. We reported all issues responsibly to the affected vendor. However, after the vendor assessed the risk it left the vulnerabilities we reported unpatched due to a limited attack scenario. In this blog post we analyze the attack scenario, the technical root cause of the code vulnerabilities, and how attackers are able to exploit these vulnerabilities.

## Impact

We detected the following vulnerabilities in the latest LocalStack version 0.12.6:

* [S5334](https://rules.sonarsource.com/python/type/Vulnerability/RSPEC-2076 "S5334"): OS Command Injection (CVE-2021-32090)
* [S5144](https://rules.sonarsource.com/python/type/Vulnerability/RSPEC-5144 "S5144"): Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
* [S5131](https://rules.sonarsource.com/python/type/Vulnerability/RSPEC-5131 "S5131"): Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) (CVE-2021-32091)
* [S2631](https://rules.sonarsource.com/python/type/Vulnerability/RSPEC-2631 "S2631"): Denial of Service via regular expressions (ReDoS)

A LocalStack instance typically runs in an internal network setup. As shown in this blog post, attackers who are not in this same network are still capable of attacking such application setups remotely. By combining different vulnerabilities, an attacker can completely compromise the local instance and execute arbitrary system commands.

Our video illustrates such an attack and shows how quickly and easily a server can be compromised.

Demo

## Technical Analysis

In this technical analysis, we first explain how applications that run locally are attacked. Then, we discuss two vulnerabilities that we found in the LocalStack code. The two vulnerabilities can be combined by an attacker to compromise and take over a LocalStack instance.

### Remote Attacks on Local Instances

When using LocalStack, we noticed that it does not use any authentication. Probably that is because the LocalStack software is run locally or in a Docker environment, as recommended by the vendor, and is therefore not directly exposed to remote attackers. However, it is a common fallacy that this type of application cannot be attacked at all. Web interfaces of network routers are a popular example of local applications that have been attacked in the real-world by criminals (*Drive-by-Pharming*).

One way for a remote attacker to interact with LocalStack running locally is through a target user’s browser. Typically, the browser of the developer who uses LocalStack is also connected to the internet to, for example, read documentation pages. When this victim visits (or is lured to) a malicious/infected website controlled by an attacker, it is possible to trigger cross-site HTTP requests to the victim’s local network via JavaScript code (*Cross-Site Request Forgery* - CSRF).

![](data:image/svg+xml;charset=utf-8...)![A LocalStack instance in a local network is attacked from an infected website remotely.]()![A LocalStack instance in a local network is attacked from an infected website remotely.](https://assets-eu-01.kc-usercontent.com:443/95361965-6528-012b-61fc-b49456de9702/d936195d-8621-470a-b4c9-36121e7abc8a/body-8eb9253e-b34b-481e-9aec-afe7da26afc1_local_stack_info1.png?w=1200&h=600&auto=format&fit=crop)

This way, an attacker can send arbitrary requests from a website to a LocalStack instance but cannot read the respective responses. This is prevented by the *cross-origin resource sharing* (CORS) mechanism in the browser. However, merely sending requests to the vulnerable application - even without being able to read the responses - is sufficient to carry out a successful attack via CSFR. The attacker blindly sends the attack payload and hopes that the vulnerable application is reached.

Moreover, LocalStack explicitly allows the execution of cross-origin requests through any page by setting special HTTP headers in the response. This means that the attacker can detect and attack a LocalStack instance through the XHR response and does not actually operate blindly.

```
access-control-allow-origin: *
access-control-allow-methods: HEAD,GET,PUT,POST,DELETE,OPTIONS,PATCH
access-control-allow-headers: authorization,content-type,content-md5,cache-control,x-amz-content-sha256,x-amz-date,x-amz-security-token,x-amz-user-agent,x-amz-target,x-amz-acl,x-amz-version-id,x-localstack-target,x-amz-tagging
access-control-expose-headers: x-amz-version-id
```

Note that modern browsers have recently further restricted cross-origin requests to reduce the potential of CSRF attacks. However, we also found a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in LocalStack which allows an attacker to bypass these protections.

### Adding a MITM Backdoor

In LocalStack, different APIs are run in local isolated processes that each have their own port. All user requests are forwarded to the respective API via a central *edge router*. For this router it is possible to configure a proxy via the LocalStack settings.

As described previously, an attacker can send arbitrary HTTP requests to LocalStack via CSRF and thereby modify the LocalStack configuration. The CSRF attack’s payload can reconfigure the edge router and add a proxy to it that points to an attacker-controlled IP as proxy host. This way, the user requests are no longer processed *locally*but are now forwarded to the attacker’s IP address. Let’s have a look at the corresponding source code.

**localstack/services/edge.py**

```
88    def do_forward_request(api, port, method, path, data, headers):
89        if config.FORWARD_EDGE_INMEM:
90            result = do_forward_request_inmem(api, port, method, path, data, headers)
91        else:
92            result = do_forward_request_network(port, method, path, data, headers)
93        if hasattr(result, 'status_code') and result.status_code >= 400 and method == 'OPTIONS':
94            # fall back to successful response for OPTIONS requests
95            return 200
96        return result
```

The function `do_forward_request()` is executed every time a request is sent to the edge router of LocalStack. In line 89 it is checked if the config entry `FORWARD_EDGE_INMEM` is set. In this case, the request is processed locally, otherwise the request is forwarded to the network. Because an attacker can set `FORWARD_EDGE_INMEM` to *False* via a CSRF attack, we reach line 92 every time. Consequently, all requests to the edge router are processed by the function `do_foward_request_network()`. Also, the HTTP responses of the respective requests are printed without sanitization.

**localstack/services/edge.py**

```
112    def do_forward_request_network(port, method, path, data, headers):
113        connect_host = '%s:%s' % (config.HOSTNAME, port)
114        url = '%s://%s%s' % (get_service_protocol(), connect_host, path)
115        function = getattr(requests, method.lower())
116        response = function(url, data=data, headers=headers, verify=False, stream=True)
117        return response
```

In line 113, the `HOSTNAME` that is used for the forwarded request is read from the configuration. Since an attacker can configure the `HOSTNAME`via CSRF attack, this host is now an attacker-controlled IP. In the following lines the request is constructed and in line 116 the request is executed which leads to a (persistent) SSRF vulnerability.

An interesting point about this feature is that the server copies the entire HTTP request from the client and forwards it to the server. This also means that the HTTP headers of the client are sent to the attacker-controlled server, including the Authorization header. This header is used for authentication in the AWS Cloud which can lead to session hijacking and stealing sensitive data from the test cloud.

As an attacker we can now go even one step further. As mentioned above, the HTTP response of the SSRF request is printed unsanitized in LocalStack. In other words, the attacker can send an XSS payload as a response via his controlled server which leads to a (persistent) Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in LocalStack. With this, the attacker has installed a persistent man-in-the-middle proxy in LocalStack that controls every HTTP request and response of the LocalStack instance. This enables abuse of further features and to trigger other code vulnerabilities.

### Command Injection Vulnerability (CVE-2021-32090)

One possible way to go further is to exploit vulnerabilities in the LocalStack dashboard. When it is active, an attacker can permanently infiltrate the system and compromise the developer’s machine via a Command Injection vulnerability. Let’s have a look at the affected code lines.

**localstack/dashboard/infra.py**

```
85    @app.route('/lambda/<functionName>/code', methods=['POST'])
86    def get_lambda_code(functionName):
...
98        result = infra.get_lambda_code(func_name=functionName, env=env)
```

In line 85 the route is defined that calls the `get_lambda_code()` function in line 86. Here, the parameter `functionName` is passed to the `get_lambda_code()` function via the path of the route. Then, in line 98, this function is executed with the user controlled input.

**localstack/dashboard/infra.py**

```
258    def get_lambda_code(func_name, retries=1, cache_time=None, env=None):
...
264        out = cmd_lambda('get-function --function-name %s' % func_name, env, cache_time)
```

In line 264, the user-controlled input `func_name` is concatenated into a system command using a format string. Without any sanitization it is passed to the `cmd_lambda()` function. When we follow the user controlled input via further functions, we end up in the `run()` function. This *data flow analysis* is exactly what our security analyzers automate for you ([open issue on SonarQube Cloud](https://sonarcloud.io/project/issues?id=SonarSourceResearch_localstack&open=AXXIAYcqSjg9uZPLRNpy&resolved=false&sonarsourceSecurity=command-injection&types=VULNERABILITY "open issue on SonarQube Cloud")).

**localstack/utils/bootstrap.py**

```
596    def run(cmd, print_error=True, stderr=subprocess.STDOUT, env_vars=None, inherit_cwd=False, inherit_env=True):
...
613        output = subprocess.check_output(cmd, shell=True, stderr=stderr, env=env_dict, cwd=cwd)
```

In line 613, the shell command is finally executed via `subprocess.check_output()`. Here, the `cmd` parameter contains the user-controlled input that ends up unsanitized in a system command. This leads to a Command Injection vulnerability since the attacker can terminate the original command and execute his own. For example, after a Command Injection, the final `cmd` parameter in line 613 can look like the following to create a new file on the system:

```
cmd =  { test `which aws` || . .venv/bin/activate; }; aws lambda get-function --function-name test;touch sonarsource.txt
```
## Summary

In this blog post we analyzed two code vulnerabilities found in the latest **LocalStack (0.12.6)**, a widely used Python application. We outlined how local applications can be attacked remotely, and how the combination of these vulnerabilities can lead to a complete takeover of a LocalStack.

We reported these vulnerabilities to the vendor in October 2020. After reaching out a couple of more times, we received notice in January that these threats are not considered a key concern since LocalStack is executed on a local machine. While we agree that real-world attacks against local instances are less likely than against directly exposed applications, we believe that developers should be aware of these risks in order to protect their setups and to write secure code for their own applications.

This vulnerability makes it possible to temporarily execute JavaScript code in the context of the application, granting access to the session of
the victim. This is possible because user-provided data, such as URL parameters, are copied into the HTML body of the HTTP response that is sent back
to the user.

## Why is this an issue?

## How can I fix it?

## More Info

Reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) occurs in a web application when the application retrieves data like parameters or headers from an incoming
HTTP request and inserts it into its HTTP response without first sanitizing it. The most common cause is the insertion of GET parameters.

When well-intentioned users open a link to a page that is vulnerable to reflected XSS, they are exposed to attacks that target their own
browser.

A user with malicious intent carefully crafts the link beforehand.

After creating this link, the attacker must use phishing techniques to ensure that his target users click on the link.

### What is the potential impact?

A well-intentioned user opens a malicious link that injects data into the web application. This data can be text, but it can also be arbitrary code
that can be interpreted by the target user’s browser, such as HTML, CSS, or JavaScript.

Below are some real-world scenarios that illustrate some impacts of an attacker exploiting the vulnerability.

#### Vandalism on the front-end website

The malicious link defaces the target web application from the perspective of the user who is the victim. This may result in loss of integrity and
theft of the benevolent user’s data.

#### Identity spoofing

The forged link injects malicious code into the web application. The code enables identity spoofing thanks to cookie theft.

#### Record user activity

The forged link injects malicious code into the web application. To leak confidential information, attackers can inject code that records keyboard
activity (keylogger) and even requests access to other devices, such as the camera or microphone.

#### Chaining XSS with other vulnerabilities

In many cases, bug hunters and attackers chain cross-site scripting vulnerabilities with other vulnerabilities to maximize their impact.
 For
example, an XSS can be used as the first step to exploit more dangerous vulnerabilities or features that require higher privileges, such as a code
injection vulnerability in the admin control panel of a web application.
