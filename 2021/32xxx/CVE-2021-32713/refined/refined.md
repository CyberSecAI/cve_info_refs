The provided content is related to the specified CVE.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The document mentions two specific vulnerabilities:
1. **SW-26001: Information leakage**
2. **SW-26050: Authenticated Stored XSS**

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Information leakage:**  This indicates a vulnerability where sensitive information is unintentionally exposed to unauthorized parties. The specific details of the leakage are not specified in this document.
2.  **Authenticated Stored XSS:** This refers to a Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability where malicious scripts can be persistently injected and stored within the application. This vulnerability is only exploitable by an attacker with valid authentication to the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information leakage:** An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, which can be used for further attacks or malicious activities.
- **Authenticated Stored XSS:** An attacker could potentially inject malicious JavaScript code into the application which would be executed by other authenticated users, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious actions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Information leakage:** The attack vector is not clearly specified.
- **Authenticated Stored XSS:** An attacker with valid credentials could inject malicious scripts within the application interface. The specifics of the injection point are not available in this document.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Information leakage:** The specific requirements are unknown.
- **Authenticated Stored XSS:** An attacker needs valid credentials to access the application and inject the malicious script.

The document also provides remediation advice:
- Update to the latest version (5.6.10)
- Install or update the security plugin (version 1.1.22)
