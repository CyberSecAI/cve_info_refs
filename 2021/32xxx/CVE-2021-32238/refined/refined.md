  "cve_id": "CVE-2021-32238",
  "description": "Epic Games / Psyonix Rocket League <=1.95 is affected by Buffer Overflow. Stack-based buffer overflow occurs when Rocket League handles UPK object files that can result in code execution and denial of service scenario.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A boundary error in the processing of UPK format files. The game attempts to read a large array of bytes from an offset after the magic header of a UPK file, leading to a stack buffer overflow.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stack-based buffer overflow",
       "Improper handling of UPK object files"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution and denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when the game processes a maliciously crafted UPK file.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to craft a malicious UPK file with a large array of bytes inserted after the magic header. The user needs to load/process the crafted file."
