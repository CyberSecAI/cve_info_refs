- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A heap-based buffer overflow in the Modem 2G RRM.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Heap-based buffer overflow leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs when the device is connecting to a 2G cellular network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: No special execution privileges or user interaction are needed for exploitation. The attacker needs to be able to cause a vulnerable device to connect to a 2G cellular network.
