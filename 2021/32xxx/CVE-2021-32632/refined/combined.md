May 20, 2021

## Package

pajbot

## Affected versions

<1.52

## Patched versions

1.52

## Description

The original security issue was reported to me by [@Melonify](https://github.com/Melonify) through proper channels the 18th of May giving me guidance throughout the fixing process

### Impact

Hosters of pajbot1

### Patches

Hosters should upgrade to `v1.52` or `stable`

### Workarounds

The upgrade is simple, adding only one modern dependency. [#1248](https://github.com/pajbot/pajbot/pull/1248) can be reviewed if a full upgrade is not available

### References

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:L/A:N

### CVE ID
