Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- User credentials were being logged in plaintext when the log level was explicitly set to `debug`. This is not the default configuration.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Plaintext Storage of Sensitive Data:** The core issue is the logging of user credentials in plaintext, which exposes sensitive information.
- **CWE-532 (Insertion of Sensitive Information into Log File):** This CWE is explicitly referenced, indicating the vulnerability is due to sensitive data ending up in log files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** An attacker with access to the debug logs could obtain user credentials (usernames and passwords), leading to unauthorized access to affected systems.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Access to Log Files:** An attacker would need access to the log files where the plaintext credentials were being recorded. This could occur through various means, such as:
    - Compromising the server where the logs are stored
    -  Accessing the logs through misconfigured systems or admin interfaces
    -  Social Engineering to obtain the log files

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low-Privilege Access:** The attacker needs low-level access to the system, specifically enough to read log files that have been configured to debug level.
- **Knowledge of Debug Logging:** The attacker needs to be aware that debug level logging stores the sensitive information.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is not present in the default TYPO3 configuration.
- The provided CVSS score is 4.9, categorized as "Moderate" severity, reflecting the fact that exploiting this vulnerability requires some level of access and that debug mode is not enabled by default.
- The issue was fixed in TYPO3 versions: 7.6.52 ELTS, 8.7.41 ELTS, 9.5.28, 10.4.18, and 11.3.1
