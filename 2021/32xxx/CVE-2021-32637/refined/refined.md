Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32637:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from how Authelia handles malformed HTTP request URIs, specifically when used with nginx's `ngx_http_auth_request_module`.
- When a malformed URI is passed to Authelia (e.g., containing characters that should be URL-encoded), the application fails to parse the target URL. Instead of returning an authentication failure (401 Unauthorized), it was incorrectly returning a success code (200).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Improper Error Handling:** Authelia did not correctly handle errors during URL parsing. It failed to return a 401 Unauthorized response when a malformed URL was encountered, which is the correct response for authentication failure.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The incorrect response code allowed attackers to bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- A malicious actor could craft a malformed HTTP request URI that would bypass authentication.
- This could potentially grant unauthorized access to protected resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The attack vector is network-based.
- The attacker sends a specially crafted HTTP request with a malformed URI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the Authelia service.
- The attacker must have knowledge of the system's use of NGINX's auth_request module with Authelia.
- The attacker must also know the character restrictions and be able to craft a URI that triggers the parsing error in Authelia.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is specific to setups using NGINX with the `ngx_http_auth_request_module`. Other supported proxy servers were not affected due to their inability to pass on malformed URI paths.
- The fix in version `v4.29.3` ensures that Authelia returns a 401 Unauthorized response when it fails to parse the URL due to malformation.
- A workaround involving an NGINX configuration was provided to mitigate the issue until an upgrade can be performed. This involves checking the request URI for invalid characters using a regex and returning a 401 if found.
- Log entries containing the message "Unable to parse target URL" and mentioning `github.com/authelia/authelia/internal/handlers/handler_verify.go` indicate a potential exploitation attempt.

The provided patch modifies the `internal/handlers/handler_verify.go` file, which contains the URL parsing logic. The change ensures that if the `getOriginalURL` function returns an error when parsing the target URL, the system will log the error and return a 401 status code via `ctx.ReplyUnauthorized()`.
