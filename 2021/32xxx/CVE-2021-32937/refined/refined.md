The provided content is related to CVE-2021-32937.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The application generates error messages that contain sensitive information, specifically the session's temporary working folder.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Generation of error messages containing sensitive information (CWE-209). The vulnerability stems from the application's behavior when using `getfile` and `putfile` commands, revealing the location of the temporary working folder.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain knowledge of the session's temporary working folder. With this knowledge, they can provide a malicious command to the working directory and initiate read and write operations, potentially leading to further compromise.

**Attack vectors:** Remote network access. An attacker could use the `getfile` and `putfile` commands in a way that exposes the temporary working folder path.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable system and the ability to interact with the functions that generate the error messages. No specific user privileges are mentioned as needed, indicating it can likely be exploited by an unauthenticated user.
