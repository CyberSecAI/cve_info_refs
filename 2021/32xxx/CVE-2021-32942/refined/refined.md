Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-32942:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to the cleartext storage of sensitive information (credentials) in memory. Specifically, InTouch stores credentials in clear text in the memory of the InTouch Runtime (WindowViewer) process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cleartext Storage of Sensitive Information in Memory (CWE-316):**  Credentials are not encrypted or protected in memory, making them vulnerable to exposure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** If exploited, an attacker could obtain cleartext credentials from a memory dump of the InTouch Runtime process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:**  The vulnerability is not directly exploitable remotely.
- **Diagnostic Memory Dump:** The attack relies on an authorized, privileged user creating a diagnostic memory dump of the InTouch Runtime (WindowViewer) process and saving it to a non-protected location.
- **Access to the Memory Dump:** An unauthorized malicious user needs to gain access to the created memory dump file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authorized User Action:** Requires an authorized privileged user to create the memory dump.
- **Local Access (to the memory dump file):** The attacker needs access to the system where the memory dump was saved, or to the dump file itself if it's been moved.
- **Malicious Intent:** The attacker needs malicious intent to obtain the memory dump and extract the credentials.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in AVEVA InTouch 2020 R2 and all prior versions.
- The provided us-cert.cisa.gov content provides a more detailed description than the CVE description placeholder. It includes a CVSS score, affected products, background, researcher credits and mitigation advice.
