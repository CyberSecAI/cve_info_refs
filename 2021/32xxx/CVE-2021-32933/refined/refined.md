- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application uses an API that allows passing a malicious file which can manipulate the process creation command line and run a command line argument, leading to the execution of a malicious process.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection (CWE-77)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to run malicious processes on the system.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker leverages an API to pass along a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**  An attacker needs to be able to pass a malicious file via the vulnerable API. The attack can be performed remotely with low complexity and does not require any privileges or user interaction.
