Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32768:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the failure to properly parse, sanitize, and encode malicious rich-text content during the content rendering process in the website frontend. The `HTMLparser` TypoScript functionality does not consider all potentially malicious HTML tag and attribute combinations by default. Additionally, the lack of comprehensive default node configuration for rich-text fields in the backend UI exacerbates the issue.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper handling of rich-text content.
- Inadequate sanitization of HTML content.
- Insufficient default configuration for rich-text fields in the backend.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website, potentially leading to:
- Execution of arbitrary JavaScript in the victim's browser.
- Stealing of session cookies or other sensitive information.
- Defacement of the website.
- Redirecting users to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
-  A valid backend user account could be used to insert malicious code via rich-text fields.
- If custom plugins accept and reflect rich-text content submitted by frontend users, no backend authentication is required, making it possible for unauthenticated attackers to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to either have a valid backend user account or be able to inject rich text content through a vulnerable frontend form or plugin.
-  The attacker needs to craft malicious HTML content.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was addressed by introducing a custom package called `typo3/html-sanitizer`, which uses allow-lists to sanitize HTML.
- Sanitization is applied during the frontend rendering process via `lib.parseFunc` and the `f:format.html` Fluid view-helper.
- Rich text data persisted using the backend UI is also sanitized.
- The fix is included in TYPO3 versions 7.6.53 ELTS, 8.7.42 ELTS, 9.5.29, 10.4.19, and 11.3.2.
