          "root_cause": "The root cause of the vulnerability existed in Pandora FMS’ PHP source code. Specifically, a failure to properly sanitize user input and the use of a wrapper which allows access to $_GET or $_POST variables directly could be exploited by attackers to launch an SQL injection attack. Pandora FMS internal functions can dynamically build SQL queries based on table names and conditions. If supplied by an attacker, these variables can end up in a SQL database without proper sanitization.",
            "weaknesses": [
              "Improper sanitization of user-controlled input",
                "Direct use of $_GET and $_POST variables",

                "SQL injection vulnerability due to dynamic query building"
            ],
            "impact": "A pre-authentication SQL injection vulnerability allows an attacker to completely bypass the administrator authentication, leading to arbitrary code execution on the system. The vulnerability can be exploited remotely without any access privileges, and can also be triggered via CSRF attacks.",
