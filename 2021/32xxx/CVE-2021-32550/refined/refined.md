{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `add_info()` function in `package-hooks/source_openjdk-*.py` allows for directory traversal by building a file path using user-controlled data (`ProcCwd`, `Pid`) without proper sanitization.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Path traversal vulnerability. The function constructs a file path by concatenating user-provided `ProcCwd` and `Pid` values without any checks, allowing an attacker to control the final path. Additionally, it doesn't check if the target file is a symlink.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files by creating a symlink and crafting a crash report that points to it using the user-controlled `ProcCwd` and `Pid` fields. This can be used to leak sensitive information.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker injects a crafted crash report file with a manipulated `ProcCwd` field and a `Pid` value. If a symlink exists at the target location, the content of the linked file is added to the crash report.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to create a crash report file and have it processed by apport. The attacker must also create a symlink to the target file and place it at the location referenced by the crafted `ProcCwd` field in the crash report."
