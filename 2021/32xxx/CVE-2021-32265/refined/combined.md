### **[biscrblx](/biscrblx)** commented [Mar 21, 2022](#issuecomment-1074407093)

| This issue was brought to our attention by <https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-32265>.  In a situation where a hdlr atom has no name defined, it is possible for this overflow to be generated.  **Analysis of the issue**  The source stream contains multiple 'hdlr' atoms. All of handler\_type 'vide'. One of these has a name, but the others don't. If no name is attached to the hdlr atom, then this access violation will occur due to the code in AP4\_HdlrAtom::WriteFields, approximately line 138.  The failure is if name\_size==0 (as retrieved at line 123 of this method) AND the size of the source atom is short enough that it shouldn't contain a name (which is valid); then it will recalculate name\_size at line 138; giving it a negative value - but due to it being a u8, it ends up being 237 characters in length, instead of 0.  **Resolution**  Check for name\_size before writing anything; if it's zero, then do not write any further data to this atom.  Diff of a fix attached.  [CVE-2021-32265.txt](https://github.com/axiomatic-systems/Bento4/files/8319103/CVE-2021-32265.txt) |
