Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-32265

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an incorrect calculation of the `name_size` variable within the `AP4_HdlrAtom::WriteFields` function when writing the handler name of an 'hdlr' atom to a byte stream. If a handler atom does not have a name, and the size of the atom is smaller than expected for it to contain a name, the code attempts to recalculate the `name_size`. Due to the usage of an `AP4_UI08` (unsigned 8-bit integer), the calculation can result in an integer overflow leading to `name_size` becoming a large value instead of zero. This then leads to an attempt to write out-of-bounds data in a `memcpy` operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Global Buffer Overflow:** A global buffer overflow occurs due to an incorrect size calculation when writing the handler name, specifically in `AP4_MemoryByteStream::WritePartial` which is called from `AP4_HdlrAtom::WriteFields`.
*   **Integer Overflow:** The `name_size` calculation uses an `AP4_UI08` which leads to an integer overflow when a handler atom doesn't have a name.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code Execution or Information Disclosure:** The overflow could allow an attacker to overwrite memory, leading to potential code execution or information disclosure by overwriting data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious MP4 File:** An attacker can craft a malicious MP4 file containing a specially crafted 'hdlr' atom which is missing the handler name to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Processing with vulnerable `mp4info`**: By processing this malformed file with the vulnerable `mp4info` utility, the overflow will be triggered, leading to a crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to provide malicious input:** An attacker must be able to provide a crafted MP4 file to the vulnerable application (`mp4info` in this case).
*   **No special privileges required:** The vulnerability can be triggered without any specific user privileges.

**More details:**
The issue occurs in `AP4_HdlrAtom::WriteFields` around line 138 when a name is not present, due to the way it recalculates `name_size`. When `m_HandlerName` is empty the size will be 0. If the atom size is smaller than it should be for it to have a name present, then a recalculation of `name_size` occurs as:

```c++
name_size = (AP4_UI08)(m_Size32 - (AP4_FULL_ATOM_HEADER_SIZE + 20));
```

Since name_size is an unsigned 8 bit integer, when `(m_Size32 - (AP4_FULL_ATOM_HEADER_SIZE + 20))` results in a negative number it will overflow into a large positive number. The code then attempts to write `name_size` bytes from `m_HandlerName` into the stream, even though it has a size of zero which leads to the buffer overflow.

The fix is to check `name_size` before writing, and to not write any further data if it's zero.
