Naming Amazon S3 objects - Amazon Simple Storage Service[AWS](https://aws.amazon.com)[Documentation](/index.html)[Amazon Simple Storage Service (S3)](/s3/index.html)[User Guide](Welcome.html)[Choosing object key names](#object-key-choose)[Object key naming guidelines](#object-key-guidelines)
# Naming Amazon S3 objects

The *object key* (or key name) uniquely identifies the object in an
Amazon S3 bucket. When you create an object, you specify the key name. For example, on the [Amazon S3
console](https://console.aws.amazon.com/s3/home), when you select a bucket, a list of objects in your bucket appears.
These names are the *object keys*.

The object key name is a sequence of Unicode characters with UTF-8 encoding of up to 1,024
bytes long. Object key names are case sensitive. The following section will provide
limitations on object key names and guidance on choosing key names.

###### Note

Object key names with the value "soap" aren't supported for [virtual-hosted-style requests](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html#virtual-hosted-style-access). For object key name values where "soap" is used, a
[path-style
URL](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/VirtualHosting.html#path-style-access) must be used instead.

## Choosing object key names

The Amazon S3 data model is a flat structure: You create a bucket, and the bucket stores
objects. There is no hierarchy of subbuckets or subfolders. However, you can infer logical
hierarchy using key name prefixes and delimiters as the Amazon S3 console does. The Amazon S3 console
supports a concept of folders. For more information about how to edit metadata from the Amazon S3
console, see [Editing object metadata in the Amazon S3 console](./add-object-metadata.html).

Suppose that your bucket (`admin-created`) has four objects with the
following object keys:

`Development/Projects.xls`

`Finance/statement1.pdf`

`Private/taxdocument.pdf`

`s3-dg.pdf`

The console uses the key name prefixes (`Development/`,
`Finance/`, and `Private/`) and delimiter ('/') to
present a folder structure. The `s3-dg.pdf` key does not have a prefix, so its object appears
directly at the root level of the bucket. If you open the `Development/`
folder, you see the `Projects.xlsx` object in it.

* Amazon S3 supports buckets and objects, and there is no hierarchy. However, by using
  prefixes and delimiters in an object key name, the Amazon S3 console and the AWS SDKs can infer
  hierarchy and introduce the concept of folders.
* The Amazon S3 console implements folder object creation by creating a zero-byte object with the folder
  *prefix and delimiter* value as the key. These folder objects don't appear in the console.
  Otherwise they behave like any other objects and can be viewed and manipulated through the REST API, AWS CLI, and AWS SDKs.
## Object key naming guidelines

You can use any UTF-8 character in an object key name. However, using certain
characters in key names can cause problems with some applications and protocols. The
following guidelines help you maximize compliance with DNS, web-safe characters, XML
parsers, and other APIs.

### Safe characters

The following character sets are generally safe for use in key names.

| Alphanumeric characters | * 0-9 * a-z * A-Z |
| --- | --- |
| Special characters | * Exclamation point (`!`) * Hyphen (`-`) * Underscore (`_`) * Period (`.`) * Asterisk (`*`) * Single quote (`'`) * Open parenthesis (`(`) * Close parenthesis (`)`) |

The following are examples of valid object key names:

* `4my-organization`
* `my.great_photos-2014/jan/myvacation.jpg`
* `videos/2014/birthday/video1.wmv`

###### Note

Objects with key names ending with period(s) "." downloaded
using the Amazon S3 console will have the period(s) "." removed from the
key name of the downloaded object. To download an object with the key
name ending in period(s) "." retained in the downloaded object,
you must use the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or REST API.

In addition, be aware of the following prefix limitations:

* Objects with a prefix of "./" must be uploaded or downloaded
  with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or REST API. You cannot
  use the Amazon S3 console.
* Object keys containing relative path elements ("../")
  are valid if, when parsed left-to-right, the cumulative count of relative path segments never exceeds the number of non-relative path elements encountered.
  This rule applies to all requests using the Amazon S3 console, Amazon S3 REST API, AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), and AWS SDKs.

  For example:

  + `videos/2014/../../video1.wmv` is valid.
  + `videos/../../video1.wmv` is invalid.
  + `videos/../../2014/video1.wmv` is invalid.
### Characters that might require special handling

The following characters in a key name might require additional code handling and
likely need to be URL encoded or referenced as HEX. Some of these are non-printable
characters that your browser might not handle, which also requires special
handling:

* Ampersand ("&")
* Dollar ("$")
* ASCII character ranges 00â1F hex (0â31 decimal) and 7F (127 decimal)
* 'At' symbol ("@")
* Equals ("=")
* Semicolon (";")
* Forward slash ("/")
* Colon (":")
* Plus ("+")
* Space â Significant sequences of spaces might be lost in some uses
  (especially multiple spaces)
* Comma (",")
* Question mark ("?")
### Characters to avoid

We recommend that you don't use the following characters in a key name because of significant special character handling, which isn't consistent across all applications.

* Backslash ("\")
* Left curly brace ("{")
* Non-printable ASCII characters (128â255 decimal characters)
* Caret ("^")
* Right curly brace ("}")
* Percent character ("%")
* Grave accent / back tick ("`")
* Right square bracket ("]")
* Quotation marks
* 'Greater Than' symbol (">")
* Left square bracket ("[")
* Tilde ("~")
* 'Less Than' symbol ("<")
* 'Pound' character ("#")
* Vertical bar / pipe ("|")
### XML related object key constraints

As specified by the [XML standard on end-of-line handling](https://www.w3.org/TR/REC-xml/#sec-line-ends),
all XML text is normalized such that single carriage returns (ASCII code 13) and carriage returns immediately followed by a
line feed (ASCII code 10) are replaced by a single line feed character. To ensure the correct parsing of object keys in XML requests,
carriage returns and [other special characters must be replaced with their
equivalent XML entity code](https://www.w3.org/TR/xml/#syntax) when they are inserted within XML tags. The following is a list of such special
characters and their equivalent entity codes:

* ' as `&apos;`
* â as `&quot;`
* & as `&amp;`
* < as `&lt;`
* > as `&gt;`
* \r as `&#13;` or `&#x0D;`
* \n as `&#10;` or `&#x0A;`

The following example illustrates the use of an XML entity code as a substitution for a carriage return.
This `DeleteObjects` request deletes an object with the `key` parameter:
`/some/prefix/objectwith\rcarriagereturn` (where the \r is the carriage return).

```
<Delete xmlns="http://s3.amazonaws.com/doc/2006-03-01/">
  <Object>
    <Key>/some/prefix/objectwith&#13;carriagereturn</Key>
  </Object>
</Delete>
```

### **[sa7mon](/sa7mon)** commented [Nov 28, 2021](#issue-1065436114)

| tl;dr In version 2.0.1 and older of S3Scanner, if a user attempts to dump the contents of a bucket which contains objects with special characters in their keys, those characters can be used to save the files outside of the folder specified with `--dump-dir`. Thanks I'd like to give a huge thanks to a security researcher named [RyotaK](https://twitter.com/ryotkak) for reporting this issue to me. They provided a detailed explanation and helped walk me through the steps to reproduce. Very excellent experience. The Bug The issue is what's commonly known as a "path traversal" vulnerability. In this case, though, it's the ability to *save* files outside the intended area as opposed to *reading* files.  For example: this bucket was created by RyotaK for demonstration purposes.  [screenshot of an S3 bucket listing showing a key called '../' and '../test.txt'](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3712226/143785640-495acf39-ff99-4bcf-8236-42abd04f2e23.png)  See how the object keys contain `../` ? When S3Scanner goes to download that file, it concatenates the dump directory and this key to form the file path the file should get downloaded to. So if a user ran the following command:  ``` s3scanner dump --dump-dir /projects/s3scanner/buckets/ --bucket s3scanner-test-bucket  ```  they would end up with a file called `test.txt` in `/projects/s3scanner/` which is one level up from where they wanted it. By adding a bunch of these characters together (`../../../../../`) an attacker could craft a malicious object key which would place their file anywhere on the S3Scanner user's system.  You may be surprised (like I was) to learn that AWS allows such characters in object keys. Their documentation [explains](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/object-keys.html) that while you can do this, there are limitations:  ...  In addition, be aware of the following prefix limitations:   * Objects with a prefix of "./" must uploaded or downloaded with the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI), AWS SDKs, or REST API. You cannot use the Amazon S3 console. * Objects with a prefix of "../" cannot be uploaded using the AWS Command Line Interface (AWS CLI) or Amazon S3 console.  In the "real world" the chances of an S3Scanner user encountering a bucket with these "malicious" keys is very low - especially considering I was not able to create such a bucket of my own. This threat poses a fairly low risk since the difficulty of pulling off the attack is a bit high and would only happen if a bad actor was purposely targeting users of this tool.  RyotaK has engaged MITRE who has reserved [CVE-2021-32061](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-32061) for this vulnerability. The CVE will be updated after this advisory has been posted. Remediation The good news is that I have already pushed the fix for this issue ([#121](https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner/pull/121)). If an object to be downloaded has a key that would land outside of the `--dump-dir`, the file won't be downloaded. The user will get a message that looks like this:  [Screenshot showing the command-line output of trying to dump the bucket referenced above which contains bad object keys. S3Scanner has skipped the files with relative path characters in their keys.](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/3712226/143785638-d1c87e52-800a-4eba-9ec5-c5f02da96d69.png)  I'll be drafting the v2.0.2 release to push out this update across the git repo, PyPi package, and Docker image. |

Fixes [#122](https://github.com/sa7mon/S3Scanner/issues/122) by adding `is_safe_file_to_download()`. This method compares the full resolved path of the file to be downloaded against the folder it should be saved into to verify the file will end up inside the folder. If not, the file is skipped and the user is informed.

Sorry, something went wrong.

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
