- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A heap-based buffer overflow exists in the Modem 2G RRM component.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122) leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution is possible when the device connects to a 2G cellular network.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered via the modem 2G RRM component when the device is connecting to a 2G cellular network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No additional execution privileges or user interaction are required. The attacker needs to be in a position to influence the device's connection to a 2G network.
