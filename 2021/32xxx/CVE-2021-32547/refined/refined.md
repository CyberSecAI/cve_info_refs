{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `add_info()` function in `package-hooks/source_openjdk-*.py` constructs a file path using user-controlled data (`ProcCwd` and `Pid`) without proper sanitization, leading to a directory traversal vulnerability. Specifically, the code does not validate if the constructed path is a regular file or a symlink.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path traversal",
      "Inadequate input validation",
	  "Following symlinks without validation"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file read. An attacker can read arbitrary files by injecting a crafted `ProcCwd` and `Pid` to construct a file path that, when resolved, points to an arbitrary location on the filesystem. This can be achieved by creating a symlink to the target file.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can create a specially crafted crash report file (e.g., `poc.crash`) with malicious values for `ProcCwd` and `ProcStatus`. When `apport` processes this crash report, the vulnerable `add_info` function will be triggered. The vulnerability is present in the `apport` crash handling mechanism when processing openjdk crash reports. The crash report file would need to be placed in /var/crash.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a crash report file in `/var/crash` with the malicious content. The attacker would also need to place a symbolic link in the path pointed to by ProcCwd. The vulnerability is exploitable on default installations."
