The provided content describes a vulnerability related to CVE-2021-32161.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in Webmin's File Manager. This XSS vulnerability is then leveraged to achieve command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Reflected XSS:** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS flaw within the Webmin File Manager.
*  **Command Injection:** The XSS is then used to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the server where Webmin is installed. This can lead to complete compromise of the system, including data theft, malware installation, and denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Remote:** The attack is described as remote, meaning the attacker can exploit the vulnerability from a network.
*   **Reflected XSS:** The attacker crafts a malicious URL that, when visited by a victim with an active webmin session, injects malicious javascript code into the page.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL that exploits the XSS vulnerability.
*   The victim needs to have an active authenticated session on the webmin server.
