Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-32856:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of HTML content pasted into the Microweber text editor. Specifically, the editor does not adequately handle malicious HTML payloads introduced via copy-paste actions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The primary vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) flaw. The text editor allows users to paste HTML content, but it does not sanitize this content effectively. This allows malicious HTML, including JavaScript, to be injected into the editor.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing cookies/credentials
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious websites
    *   Other client-side attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is the copy-paste functionality of the Microweber text editor. An attacker needs to craft a malicious HTML payload, which the victim is then tricked into copying and pasting into the editor, during a live-edit session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   * The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious HTML payload.
   * The attacker must trick the victim into copying the malicious HTML payload.
   * The victim must have access to a live-edit session within Microweber and must have the ability to edit text using the vulnerable text editor.

**Additional Notes:**
   * The vulnerability was initially fixed, but the fix was reverted because it broke other functionalities, indicating potential issues with the initial mitigation approach.
   * A patch was later released in v1.2.12, but the provided advisory indicates the initial fix was not complete, and a further vulnerability was reported to the maintainer.
   * The vulnerability can be triggered using a simple `<img>` tag with an `onload` or `onerror` attribute containing javascript.
   * This vulnerability was identified using a CodeQL query.
