## Summary

Copy-paste XSS in Microweber text editor

## Product

Microweber

## Tested Version

[v1.2.8](https://github.com/microweber/microweber/releases/tag/v1.2.8)

## Details

### Issue: Copy-paste XSS in Microweber (`GHSL-2021-1005`)

The Microweber text editor is vulnerable to copy-paste cross-site scripting (XSS). For this particular type of XSS, the victim needs to be fooled into copying a malicious payload into the text editor.

Proof of concept (tested on Chrome):

* Open this page: cdn.sekurak.pl/copy-paste/playground.html
* Paste the following code into “HTML Input”
  ```
    <img src="foo" onload="alert(1)" onerror="alert(2)"/>

  ```
* Click “Copy as HTML”
* Log in to the admin page, and start a live-edit session.
* For example, just open https://demo.microweber.org/ and it will automatically log you into a demo account.
* Open https://demo.microweber.org/demo/modern-golder-watch
* Select some of the text, such that you can write in it
* Paste into the text editor.

Note: This issue was found using the following [CodeQL](https://securitylab.github.com/tools/codeql/) [query](https://codeql.github.com/codeql-query-help/javascript/js-xss/)

#### Impact

This issue may lead to XSS with user interaction

## CVE
