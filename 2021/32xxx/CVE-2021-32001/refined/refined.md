- **Root cause of vulnerability:** K3s/RKE2 bootstrap data is encrypted using an empty string if the user does not supply a token.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The vulnerability is that the bootstrap data is not properly encrypted if no token is provided by the user, effectively resulting in no encryption of the data.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  Sensitive bootstrap data is exposed due to the lack of encryption.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability occurs when K3s/RKE2 is configured without a user-provided token.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker could potentially gain access to the exposed bootstrap data if they are in a position to intercept or access the unencrypted data.
