{
  "CVE-2021-32743": {
    "description": "API responses for `IdoMysqlConnection`, `IdoPgsqlConnection`, `IcingaDB` and `ElasticsearchWriter` objects contained the attribute `password` exposing the password used to authenticate against these services.",
    "root_cause": "The Icinga 2 API was unintentionally exposing passwords used to connect to external services through the API responses of specific objects.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Information Exposure",
      "Inadequate access control"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker who obtained these credentials can impersonate Icinga to these services and add, modify, and delete information. The impact increases if the compromised credentials have more permissions.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network access to the Icinga 2 API"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Authenticated API user with read permissions for affected object types"
    ],
    "additional_details": "Affected object types include: `IdoMysqlConnection`, `IdoPgsqlConnection`, `IcingaDB` and `ElasticsearchWriter`. The issue is resolved in Icinga 2 versions 2.11.10 and 2.12.5."
