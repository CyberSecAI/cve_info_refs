SECURITY BULLETIN AVEVA-2021-003

Title
SuiteLink Server – Multiple Denial of Service (DoS) Vulnerabilities and theoretical Remote Code
Execution (RCE)

Rating
High

Published By
AVEVA Software Security Response Center

Overview
AVEVA Software, LLC. (“AVEVA”) has created a security update to address vulnerabilities in the SuiteLink
Server. The vulnerabilities, if exploited, will cause the SuiteLink Server to crash while parsing a malicious
packet. Additionally, it may theoretically be possible to achieve Remote Code Execution, but no proof-
of-concept exists. SuiteLink Clients are not affected by this vulnerability and do not need to be patched.

The following products ship a vulnerable version of the SuiteLink Server and are affected:

•  AVEVA™ System Platform 2020 R2 P01 and all prior versions

•  AVEVA™ InTouch 2020 R2 P01 and all prior versions

•  AVEVA™ Historian 2020 R2 P01 and all prior versions

•  AVEVA™ Communication Drivers Pack 2020 R2 and all prior versions

•  AVEVA™ Operations Integration Core 3.0 and all prior versions

•  AVEVA™ Data Acquisition Servers all versions

•  AVEVA™ Batch Management 2020 and all prior versions

•  AVEVA™ MES 2014 R2 and all prior versions

Recommendations
AVEVA recommends that organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on their
operational environment, architecture, and product implementation.

Customers using affected versions of products should apply the corresponding security update. Note
that a subset of the updates require Activation-based Licensing.

NVD Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS v3)
The U.S. Department of Homeland Security has adopted the Common Vulnerability Scoring System
(CVSS v3) that provides an open framework for communicating the characteristics and impacts of IT
vulnerabilities.  CVSS v3 produces a numerical score as well as a textual representation of that score
reflecting the severity of a vulnerability.  Scores range from 0.0 (no impact) to a maximum of 10.0
(critical impact with minimal effort to exploit). For additional information please refer to the CVSS v3.1
specifications.
