- **Root cause of vulnerability:** An authenticated user can repeatedly invoke the `features` command, which, at high volume, can lead to resource depletion or high lock contention.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Resource exhaustion due to lack of throttling on the `features` command.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Denial of service (DoS), and in rare cases, potential `id` field collisions which implies data integrity issues.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based, authenticated access to the MongoDB server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user without any specific authorizations to be able to repeatedly call the `features` command.
