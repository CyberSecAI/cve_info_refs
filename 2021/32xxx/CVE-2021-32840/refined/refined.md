{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from insufficient validation of file paths during TAR archive extraction, specifically related to the handling of parent directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Path Traversal: The application fails to properly sanitize or validate file paths within TAR archives, allowing an attacker to specify paths that write files outside of the intended extraction directory.",
       "Missing Slash Termination Enforcement:  The application does not enforce that the destination directory path ends with a slash, allowing creation of files in unintended locations."
      ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file write, potentially leading to code execution if an attacker can write an executable file to a location where it can be executed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Maliciously crafted TAR archive: An attacker creates a TAR archive containing entries with file paths that include traversal sequences, targeting write operations outside of the extraction directory.",
      "Targeting extraction without proper slash terminated path: An attacker crafts a TAR or ZIP archive with file paths exploiting the missing slash termination enforcement."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to create a malicious archive file and have the target application extract that file. The attacker needs knowledge of target filesystem layout."
  },
  "affected_versions": "0.86.0 <= SharpZipLib <= 1.2.0",
  "cve_id": "CVE-2021-32840"
