## Package

Vapor
(SwiftPM)

## Affected versions

4.47.1

## Patched versions

A bug in the `Data.init(base32Encoded:)` function opens up the potential for exposing server memory and/or crashing the server (Denial of Service) for applications where untrusted data can end up in said function.

### Patches

This issue has been patched in 4.47.2.
