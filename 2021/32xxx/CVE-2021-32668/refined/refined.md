Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Improper encoding of error messages in the `QueryGenerator` and `QueryView` components.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- CWE-79: Improper Neutralization of Input During Web Page Generation ('Cross-site Scripting')

**Impact of exploitation:**

  -  Malicious actions being performed in the context of the victim's browser session.
  -  Potential data theft.
  -  Redirection to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered through the `QueryGenerator` and `QueryView` components.
- An attacker needs to inject malicious code into fields that are not properly sanitized.
- Error messages are generated with unencoded output, which can then be reflected back to the user or stored persistently.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- A valid backend user account with administrator privileges is required.
- Attacker needs the ability to interact with the vulnerable components to trigger the error messages.
