# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# reg-keygen-git-hash-plugin

A reg-suit plugin to detect the snapshot key to be compare with using Git commit hash.

## Install

```
npm i reg-keygen-git-hash-plugin -D
```

## Detection expected commit

This plugin detects automatically the parent's commit which is the source of the topic branch. And use the snapshot result of the detected commit as the expected result of regression testing.

[![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/reg-viz/reg-suit/HEAD/images/gh_flow.png)](https://github.com/reg-viz/reg-suit/blob/HEAD/images/gh_flow.png)

And if your topic branch has the merge commit from the parent(i.e. `master`) branch, this plugin uses this merge commit hash as the expected snapshot key.
