### Fix seqset iterator when it ends in a comma.

```

If the seqset ended with a comma, the substr_end marker would be just
before the trailing nul.  In the next call, the loop to skip the
marker would iterate right past the end of string too.

The fix is simple: place the substr_end marker and skip past it
immediately.

# Mutt, NeoMutt: Denial of service — GLSA **202105-05**

A vulnerability in Mutt and NeoMutt could lead to a Denial of
Service condition.

### Affected packages

| Package | **mail-client/mutt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **2.0.7** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **2.0.7** |

| Package | **mail-client/neomutt** on all architectures |
| --- | --- |
| Affected versions | < **20210205-r1** |
| Unaffected versions | >= **20210205-r1** |

### Background

Mutt is a small but very powerful text-based mail client.

NeoMutt is a command line mail reader (or MUA). It’s a fork of Mutt
with added features.

### Description

It was discovered that Mutt, and NeoMutt did not properly handle certain
situations where an IMAP sequence set ends with a comma.

### Impact

A remote attacker could entice a user to connect to a malicious IMAP
server to cause a Denial of Service condition, or other unspecified
impacts.

### Workaround

There is no known workaround at this time.

### Resolution

All Mutt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/mutt-2.0.7"

```

All NeoMutt users should upgrade to the latest version:

```
 # emerge --sync
 # emerge --ask --oneshot --verbose ">=mail-client/neomutt-20210205-r1"

```
