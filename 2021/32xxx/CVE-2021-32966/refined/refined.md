- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The Philips Interoperability Solution XDS, when configured to use LDAP via TLS, is vulnerable to clear text transmission of sensitive information when the domain controller returns LDAP referrals. This occurs because the system does not properly encrypt LDAP credentials when referrals are being followed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Clear text transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can remotely read LDAP system credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** Network access. An attacker would need to gain access to the network channel used for communication between the affected system and the domain controller.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to monitor the traffic between the affected system and the domain controller and needs to be able to intercept network traffic, particularly the LDAP communication. The attacker does not need any privileges or user interaction to exploit the vulnerability.
