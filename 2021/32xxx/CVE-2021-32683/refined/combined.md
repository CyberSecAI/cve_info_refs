# XSS through createObjectURL

High

[franziskuskiefer](/franziskuskiefer)
published
GHSA-382j-mmc8-m5rw
Jun 15, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 2021-06-01-production.0

## Patched versions

2021-06-01-production.0

## Description

### Impact

If a user is instructed to open an image in a new tab (right click -> open in new tab, or copy the URL and paste it in the URL bar), an the image payload is executed on the domain hosting the app (app.wire.com).

In particular, if an image contains malicious code in addition to the actual picture, this code is executed on app.wire.com.

This allows the attacker to fully control the user account.

### Patches

Before sending blob objects to [URL.createObjectURL](https://developer.mozilla.org/de/docs/Web/API/URL/createObjectURL), we inspect their MIME type. Only image MIME types will be forwarded which prevents objects of MIME type "text/html" to execute JavaScript code.

### Workarounds

Users should not try to open image URLs.
