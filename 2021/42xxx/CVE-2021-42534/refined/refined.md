- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The web application of the affected Trane product does not properly neutralize input during webpage generation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability (CWE-79)
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to redirect a user to a malicious webpage and steal the user's cookie.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could inject code into input forms of the web application. This is achievable remotely.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires network access to the affected Trane building automation controller and the ability to inject malicious code. The attack complexity is low and does not require user interaction. A low privilege account is needed.
