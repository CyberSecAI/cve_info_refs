Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-42268:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **CVE ID:** CVE-2021-42268
*   **Vulnerability Type:** NULL Pointer Dereference ([CWE-476](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/476.html))
*   **Impact:** Application denial-of-service
*   **Severity:** Important
*   **CVSS Base Score:** 5.5
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a NULL Pointer Dereference. This occurs when the application attempts to access a memory location through a pointer that is currently pointing to a null address.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **NULL Pointer Dereference (CWE-476):** The core vulnerability is a dereference of a NULL pointer within the Adobe Animate software. This suggests a flaw in how the software handles certain data or control flows, leading to a NULL pointer assignment, which is then subsequently dereferenced.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application Denial-of-Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to the denial-of-service of the application.  The attempt to dereference a NULL pointer typically results in a crash or unexpected termination of the program.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access (AV:L):** The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   **Low Attack Complexity (AC:L):** The attack is relatively easy to execute once the attacker has achieved local access.
*   **No Privileges Required (PR:N):** No special privileges are needed to exploit this vulnerability, only the ability to run the program.
*   **User Interaction Required (UI:R):** The attacker requires the user to perform some interaction, such as opening a malicious file, which triggers the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have local access to a vulnerable system running Adobe Animate.
*   The attacker needs to entice the user to open a specially crafted file that exploits the NULL pointer dereference.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Important" in terms of severity by Adobe.
*   The CVSS vector indicates that while the confidentiality and integrity impacts are none, the availability is high, which aligns with the denial-of-service impact.
