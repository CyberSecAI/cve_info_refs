- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application allows uploading of attachments to tickets via articles. Some of these attachments are not properly sanitized and can contain malicious JavaScript code that bypasses the Content-Security-Policy.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability arises from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied data (attachments) leading to the injection of malicious scripts.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser when they view the malicious attachment. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions within the Zammad application.
- **Attack vectors**:  The attack vector is through the upload of a specially crafted file containing malicious JavaScript code as an attachment to a ticket article.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to upload attachments to tickets, implying they need to be an authorized user with the required permissions.
