- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the WECON PLC Editor software when processing project files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787).
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the PLC Editor processes a specially crafted project file. The attack requires a local attacker that has the user to open a malicious file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the ability to get the target user to open a specially crafted project file with the vulnerable WECON PLC Editor software. The attack is not remotely exploitable.
