*   The provided text includes the following entry which is directly related to the vulnerability specified:
    *   "**Build 4421** Released on Oct 8, 2021
        **Security Issue fixed:**
        *   Authentication bypass leading to arbitrary file-upload remote code execution vulnerability (CVE-2021-42099), reported by moon."

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is an **authentication bypass**, which allows an attacker to bypass normal authentication mechanisms.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the authentication process.
*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The vulnerability allows for uploading files of the attacker's choosing.
*    **Remote Code Execution:** The uploaded files can then be used to execute arbitrary code on the server, indicating a critical security flaw.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation leads to arbitrary code execution on the affected system.
*   **Complete System Compromise:** Full control of the server is possible, allowing attackers to steal data, modify configurations, or cause service disruption.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is via the network, targeting a vulnerable component of the ManageEngine application.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the server running the vulnerable application.
*   **Exploit Knowledge:** The attacker needs to know the details of the authentication bypass vulnerability and how to exploit it for file upload and RCE.

**Summary of Vulnerability Information:**

This vulnerability is a high-severity issue due to the combination of authentication bypass, arbitrary file upload, and remote code execution. An attacker with network access and knowledge of the exploit could gain full control of the server running ManageEngine M365 Manager Plus. The specific vulnerable component is not stated but is within the application's attack surface. This information extracted from the release notes provides more details compared to a generic CVE description.
