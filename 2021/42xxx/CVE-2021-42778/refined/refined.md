Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a double free error within the `sc_pkcs15_free_tokeninfo` function of the OpenSC library. Specifically, the commit message indicates that the issue occurs when the code attempts to free a memory buffer a second time, after it has already been freed. This double-free was triggered in the `idprime_get_token_name` function. The fix involved creating a temporary variable to hold the data instead of modifying the original variable passed to the function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap Double Free:** The core weakness is a heap double-free vulnerability. This occurs when the same block of memory on the heap is deallocated multiple times.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:**  A double free can lead to memory corruption. This can range from application crashes to potentially enabling arbitrary code execution by corrupting memory management structures.
- **Denial of Service:** Exploiting this vulnerability could result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition by causing the application to crash due to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Smart Card Interaction:** The vulnerability is triggered when interacting with a specific type of smart card using the OpenSC library. This would involve using a card that triggers the vulnerable code path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Interact with Smart Card:** The attacker needs the ability to use the OpenSC library to interact with a vulnerable smart card. This usually involves a physical connection to the smart card reader.
- **Knowledge of Vulnerable Smart Card:** The attacker needs to be aware of the specific type of smart card that triggers the vulnerability and the way it interacts with OpenSC.
- **User interaction:** User has to use an application which uses vulnerable version of the library.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz.
- The fix involved using a temporary variable when reading the token name.
- The vulnerability is present in OpenSC versions before 0.22.0.
- Red Hat bug report indicates this vulnerability also has tracking bugs in fedora-33 and other related issues.

In summary, CVE-2021-42778 is a heap double-free vulnerability in the `sc_pkcs15_free_tokeninfo` function of the OpenSC library, triggered via specific smart card interactions. Exploitation can lead to memory corruption, potentially resulting in a denial of service or arbitrary code execution.
