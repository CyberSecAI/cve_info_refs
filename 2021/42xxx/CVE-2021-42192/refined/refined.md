{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by the lack of proper authorization checks when updating user information, specifically the 'admin' attribute.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Privilege Escalation",
      "Insecure Direct Object Reference (IDOR)"
    ],
    "impact": "A low-privileged authenticated user can escalate their privileges to become an administrator, gaining full control over the Konga instance and potentially the underlying Kong API gateway.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "HTTP PUT request to the `/api/user/{id}` endpoint"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be an authenticated user with a valid session token.",
    "additional_details": "The provided exploit code demonstrates how to obtain a user's ID and then send a PUT request to the `/api/user/{id}` endpoint to set the `admin` attribute to `true`, effectively promoting the user to administrator. The vulnerability exists because there is no validation on the server-side that prevents this action from a non-admin user."
