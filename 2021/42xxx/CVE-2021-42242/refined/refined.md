Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure deserialization of a JSON configuration file (`config.json`) within the `jfinal_cms` application. The application uses the `fastjson` library to parse this configuration file, and a specially crafted payload within this file can lead to remote code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The application deserializes user-controlled data (the `config.json` file content) using `fastjson` without proper validation. This allows an attacker to inject malicious objects, leading to command execution.
*   **File Upload/Replacement:** The attacker exploits a file upload or replacement vulnerability to overwrite the legitimate `config.json` file with a malicious one containing the payload. The details of the file upload vulnerability is not given in the provided context.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server hosting the application, potentially leading to full system compromise.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Craft Malicious Payload:** An attacker crafts a malicious JSON payload designed to trigger the `fastjson` deserialization vulnerability. This payload uses `com.sun.rowset.JdbcRowSetImpl` along with a JNDI lookup (RMI or LDAP) to initiate the exploitation.
2.  **Upload/Replace `config.json`:**  The attacker uses a file upload or replacement vulnerability in the backend admin interface to replace the legitimate `config.json` file with the crafted payload.
3.  **Trigger Deserialization:** Accessing the `/ueditor` route triggers the instantiation of `ActionEnter` and subsequently `ConfigManager`, which reads and parses the replaced `config.json` file. This deserialization of the malicious payload causes the remote code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to backend admin interface:** The attacker needs to be able to log in to the backend of the `jfinal_cms` application. The default username and password (`admin/admin123`) is mentioned as part of the attack steps.
*   **Ability to upload/replace files:** The attacker needs to exploit a file upload/replace vulnerability or have the required permissions to replace the existing `config.json` file.
*   **Knowledge of JNDI and `fastjson` vulnerabilities:** The attacker needs to be familiar with JNDI injection techniques and how to exploit `fastjson` deserialization vulnerabilities.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to access the target system and have network connectivity to the JNDI exploit server.

**Additional details:**

*   The `fastjson` version used is `1.2.28`, which is known to be vulnerable.
*   The attack relies on a JNDI service (RMI or LDAP) to deliver the malicious payload.
*   The application uses the `Ueditor` component which is where the vulnerability lies.
