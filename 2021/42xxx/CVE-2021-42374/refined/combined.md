## Background

Embedded devices with limited memory and storage resources are likely to leverage a tool such as [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/), which is marketed as the Swiss Army Knife of embedded Linux. BusyBox is a software suite of many useful Unix utilities, known as applets, that are packaged as a single executable file. Within BusyBox you can find a full-fledged shell, a DHCP client/server, and small utilities such as `cp`, `ls`, `grep`, and others. You’re likely to find many OT and IoT devices running BusyBox, including popular programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and remote terminal units (RTUs)—many of which now run on Linux.

As part of our commitment to [improving open-source software security,](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/open-source-security-foundation-raises-10-million-in-new-commitments-to-secure-software-supply-chains-301399530.html) Claroty’s Team82 and JFrog collaborated on a vulnerability research project examining BusyBox. Using static and dynamic techniques, Claroty’s Team82 and JFrog discovered 14 vulnerabilities affecting the latest version of BusyBox. All vulnerabilities were privately disclosed and fixed by BusyBox in version 1.34.0, which was [released Aug. 19](https://busybox.net/).

In most cases, the expected impact of these issues is denial of service (DoS). However, in rarer cases, these issues can also lead to information leaks and possibly remote code execution.

In this report, we provide details on the vulnerabilities we discovered, elaborate on who is affected, discuss our research methodology, explain one of the vulnerabilities in depth, and suggest fixes and workarounds for these issues.

In addition to disclosing the vulnerabilities, Team82 is also [open-sourcing](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing) our custom AFL fuzzing harnesses, which were responsible for triggering many of the mentioned vulnerabilities. Hopefully this will help fellow researchers find and disclose more issues.

## Triggering the Vulnerabilities

Since the affected applets are not daemons, each vulnerability can only be exploited if the vulnerable applet is fed with untrusted data (usually through a command-line argument). Specifically, these are the conditions that must occur for each vulnerability to be triggered:

**CVE-2021-42373** – Applies if the attacker can control all parameters passed to [`man`](https://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html#man).

`man` is built by the default BusyBox configuration, but not shipped with Ubuntu’s default BusyBox binary.

**CVE-2021-42374** – Applies if the attacker can supply a crafted compressed file, that will be decompressed by using [`unlzma`](https://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html#unlzma).

Note that even if the unlzma applet is not available, but `CONFIG_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_LZMA` (enabled by default) is enabled, other applets such as `tar`, `unzip`, `rpm`, `dpkg,lzma` and `man` can also reach the vulnerable code when handling a file with the `.lzma` filename suffix.

`unlzma` is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu’s default BusyBox binary.

**CVE-2021-42375** – Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to [`ash`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell) that contains the special characters $, {, }, # .

`ash` is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu’s default BusyBox binary.

**CVE-2021-42376** – Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to [`hush`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) that contains the special character \x03 (delimiter).

`hush` is built by the default BusyBox configuration but not shipped with Ubuntu’s default BusyBox binary.

**CVE-2021-42377** – Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to [`hush`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) that contains the special character &.

**CVE-2021-42378 – CVE-2021-42386** – Applies if the attacker can supply an arbitrary pattern to [`awk`](https://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html#awk) (the pattern is the first positional argument this applet takes).

`awkƒ` is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu’s default BusyBox binary.

##

## Research Methodology

To research BusyBox, we used static and dynamic analysis approaches.

First, a manual review of the BusyBox source code was conducted in a top-down approach (following user input up to specific applet handling). We also looked for obvious logical/memory corruption vulnerabilities.

The next approach was fuzzing. We compiled BusyBox with [ASan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer) and implemented an [AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL) harness for each BusyBox applet. Each harness was subsequently optimized by removing unnecessary parts of the code, running multiple fuzzing cycles on the same process ([persistent mode](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2015/06/new-in-afl-persistent-mode.html)), and running multiple fuzzed instances in parallel.

We started from fuzzing all the daemon applets, including HTTP, Telnet, DNS, DHCP, NTP and others. Many code changes were required in order to effectively fuzz network-based input. For example, the main modification we performed was to replace all recv functions with input from STDIN in order to support fuzzed inputs. Similar changes were done when we fuzzed non-server applets as well.

We prepared a couple of examples for each applet and ran hundreds of fuzzed BusyBox instances for a few days. This gave us tens of thousands of crashes to evaluate. We had to create classes of crashes with the same root cause to help reduce the volume of crashes we had in our sample set. Later, we minimized each group representative in order to work with a small subset of unique crash inputs.

To fulfill these tasks, we developed automatic tooling that digested all crash data and classified it based on the crash analysis report which mainly includes the crash stack trace, registers, and assembly code of the relevant code area. For example, we merged cases with similar crash stack traces because they usually had the same problematic root cause.

Finally, we researched each unique crash and minimized its input vector in order to understand the root cause, which allowed us to create a proof-of-concept (PoC) that exploits the vulnerability responsible for the crash. In addition, we tested our PoCs against several BusyBox versions to understand when the bugs were introduced to the source code.

In summary, following are the steps we took in our research:

1. Code review
2. Fuzzing
3. Reduction & Minimization
4. Triage
5. PoC
6. Testing multiple versions
7. Disclosure

## Guide and Resources for BusyBox Fuzzing

As part of our commitment to the open source security and security communities, we created a simple on-boarding guide detailing how to fuzz BusyBox. The guide is published alongside all of the fuzzing harnesses we wrote as part of our fuzzing efforts. We hope these fuzzing harnesses can be further improved by the community, in order to find and fix even more bugs in BusyBox.

All materials are available on [Claroty’s GitHub page](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing).

## Threat Analysis

To assess the threat level posed by these vulnerabilities, we inspected JFrog’s database of more than 10,000 embedded firmware images (composed of only publicly available firmware images, and not ones uploaded to JFrog Artifactory). We found that 40% of them contained a BusyBox executable file that is linked with one of the affected applets, making these issues extremely widespread among Linux-based embedded firmware.

However, we believe these issues do not currently pose a critical security threat because:

1. The DoS vulnerabilities are trivial to exploit, but the impact is usually mitigated by the fact that applets almost always run as a separate forked process.
2. The information leak vulnerability is nontrivial to exploit (see, next section).
3. The use-after-free vulnerabilities may be exploitable for remote code execution, but currently we did not attempt to create a weaponized exploit for them. In addition, it is quite rare (and inherently unsafe) to process an `awk` pattern from external input.

## Deep Dive on CVE-2021-42374 – LZMA OOB Read

Lempel–Ziv–Markov Chain Algorithm (LZMA) and Range Coding

[LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm) is a compression algorithm that uses dictionary compression, and encodes its output using a range encoder. The dictionary compressor finds matches using sophisticated dictionary data structures, and produces a stream of literal symbols and phrase references, which are encoded one bit at a time by the range encoder, using a complex model to make a probability prediction of each bit.

The compression algorithm encodes the compressed stream as a stream of bits using an adaptive binary range coder. Data is broken into packets, where each packet describes either a single byte, or an LZ77 sequence, with its length and distance implicitly or explicitly encoded.

The .lzma format consists of a 13-byte header followed by the LZMA compressed data. Here is a small example of compressing the string “abc” using:![LZMA file format](data:image/svg+xml...)![LZMA file format](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07132002/LZMA-file-format.png)

In order to output the decompressed stream, LZMA implementations use a memory buffer that is initialized in the size of the user-provided dictionary size (part of the LZMA header). Once that buffer is filled, it automatically outputs the data thus far, flushes the buffer and starts filling it up again.

### The Vulnerability

The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient size check in the `unpack_lzma_stream` function (in decompress\_unlzma.c) when the state >= `LZMA_NUM_LIT_STATES`:

```
while (global_pos + buffer_pos < header.dst_size) {
    ...
    uint32_t pos;

    pos = buffer_pos - rep0;
    if ((int32_t)pos < 0)           // Insufficient check
        pos += header.dict_size; 	// dict_size is user-controlled
    match_byte = buffer[pos]; 	// Read OOB may occur here
    do {
        int bit;

        match_byte <<= 1;
        bit = match_byte & 0x100;
        ...
```

To trigger the vulnerability and to control the starting offset where we will leak data from, we need to make sure that the following conditions are satisfied:

`buffer_pos = 0

and

rep0 = offset + dict_size`

This way, `pos` will be equal to `-(offset + dict_size)`. After adding `dict_size`, `pos` will be `-offset` and so we could leak memory from our desired offset through match\_byte. The leaked memory will most likely contain pointers which could further assist attackers in their exploitation campaign (ex. by facilitating ASLR bypass).

### Causing an Out-of-Bounds Access

The general idea to exploit this vulnerability is to prepare a specifically crafted LZMA encoded stream, so that when it is decoded, both conditions will be filled and `pos` will be equal to a negative number `-offset`. Eventually, the decompressed stream will contain the leaked memory, which will be written to the output steam.

To satisfy the first condition `buffer_pos = 0`, we need to make sure our code flow (`state >= LZMA_NUM_LIT_STATES`) is reached right after the current decompressed buffer stream is flushed and so the buffer pointer position will be 0. We can achieve this by reaching the last iteration of a current match:

```
buffer[buffer_pos++] = previous_byte;
if (buffer_pos == header.dict_size) {
	buffer_pos = 0;
	global_pos += header.dict_size;
	if (transformer_write(xstate, buffer, header.dict_size) != (ssize_t)header.dict_size)
		goto bad;
	IF_DESKTOP(total_written += header.dict_size;)
}
len--;
} while (len != 0 && buffer_pos < header.dst_size); // match_last_iteration will end with buffer_pos = 0;
```

The second condition is more difficult to satisfy and requires intimate knowledge of how the LZMA algorithm works. The general idea is to encode a special length in the LZMA bit stream so that when decoded it will be used by the `rep0` variable.

To conclude, in order to reach an OOB condition, we need to write some bytes, then use a match to fill the buffer to `header.dict_size and` change `rep0` to our desired value. Therefore, `pos` will be equal `-offset` and we could leak bytes from offset as a reference to the buffer pointer.

### Leaking Bits from Out-of-Bounds Memory

After reading the `match_byte`, we will get to this flow:

```
do {
	int bit;

	match_byte <<= 1;
	bit = match_byte & 0x100;
	bit ^= (rc_get_bit(rc, prob + 0x100 + bit + mi, &mi) << 8); /* 0x100 or 0 */
	if (bit)
		break;
} while (mi < 0x100);

while (mi < 0x100) {
	rc_get_bit(rc, prob + mi, &mi);
}
```

As long as the bits match our match\_byte (the leaked byte), it will be in the loop that reads the probability from `prob + 0x100 + bit + mi`, but once one bit is not matched, it reads it from `prob + mi`. We can detect what was the first unmatched bit, by checking if `prob + mi` was changed by writing more literal bytes, or if the probability was changed and we got a different output. Finally, the leaked bits will get flushed to the decompressed buffer.

### Weaponizing ZIP Files

Although the vulnerability was found in the LZMA decompression algorithm, we found that many applets support an LZMA compression and will try to decompress encoded LZMA streams by default (see section, “Fixes and Workarounds” for the configuration flags governing this behavior). For example, the ubiquitous ZIP format supports LZMA compression as a “type 14” compression.

From an attacker’s perspective, ZIP is a much better attack vector since:

* `unzip` invocations are much more common than direct invocations of `unlzma`.
* With this attack vector, there are no constraints on the filename that’s going to be unzipped (unlike in the tar attack vector, which requires a `.lzma` suffix).
* The leaked data can be extracted and saved into files that can be later read remotely. For example, this can happen in an embedded web service that permits uploading zip files with media resources, which will get extracted to an accessible location. From there, the attacker could read the leaked memory data.

To test this, we built a small PoC script that generates a weaponized ZIP where one of the files is compressed using LZMA:

## Fixes and Workarounds

All 14 vulnerabilities have been fixed in BusyBox 1.34.0 ([direct download link](https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.34.0.tar.bz2)) and users are urged to upgrade.

If upgrading BusyBox is not possible (due to specific version compatibility needs), BusyBox 1.33.1 and earlier versions can be compiled without the vulnerable functionality (applets) as a workaround.

After running `make defconfig` in BusyBox’s source directory (or if reusing a previous configuration), edit the `.config` file as such:

* `man` – Comment out `CONFIG_MAN=y`
* `lzma` – Comment out `CONFIG_UNLZMA=y`, `CONFIG_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_LZMA=y` and `CONFIG_FEATURE_UNZIP_LZMA=y`
* `ash` – Comment out `CONFIG_ASH=y`
* `hush` – Comment out `CONFIG_HUSH=y`
* `awk` – Comment out `CONFIG_AWK=y`

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Denys Vlasenko from BusyBox’s development team for validating and fixing all of the above issues in a swift manner [for version 1.34.0](https://busybox.net/).

# NAME

BusyBox - The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux

---

# SYNTAX

```

 busybox <applet> [arguments...]  # or
```
```

 <applet> [arguments...]          # if symlinked
```

---

# DESCRIPTION

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities
you usually find in GNU coreutils, util-linux, etc. The utilities in BusyBox
generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the
options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very
much like their GNU counterparts.

BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in mind.
It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude commands (or
features) at compile time. This makes it easy to customize your embedded
systems. To create a working system, just add /dev, /etc, and a Linux kernel.
BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or embedded
system.

BusyBox is extremely configurable. This allows you to include only the
components you need, thereby reducing binary size. Run 'make config' or 'make
menuconfig' to select the functionality that you wish to enable. Then run
'make' to compile BusyBox using your configuration.

After the compile has finished, you should use 'make install' to install
BusyBox. This will install the 'bin/busybox' binary, in the target directory
specified by CONFIG\_PREFIX. CONFIG\_PREFIX can be set when configuring BusyBox,
or you can specify an alternative location at install time (i.e., with a
command line like 'make CONFIG\_PREFIX=/tmp/foo install'). If you enabled
any applet installation scheme (either as symlinks or hardlinks), these will
also be installed in the location pointed to by CONFIG\_PREFIX.

---

# USAGE

BusyBox is a multi-call binary. A multi-call binary is an executable program
that performs the same job as more than one utility program. That means there
is just a single BusyBox binary, but that single binary acts like a large
number of utilities. This allows BusyBox to be smaller since all the built-in
utility programs (we call them applets) can share code for many common
operations.

You can also invoke BusyBox by issuing a command as an argument on the
command line. For example, entering

```

        /bin/busybox ls
```

will also cause BusyBox to behave as 'ls'.

Of course, adding '/bin/busybox' into every command would be painful. So most
people will invoke BusyBox using links to the BusyBox binary.

For example, entering

```

        ln -s /bin/busybox ls
        ./ls
```

will cause BusyBox to behave as 'ls' (if the 'ls' command has been compiled
into BusyBox). Generally speaking, you should never need to make all these
links yourself, as the BusyBox build system will do this for you when you run
the 'make install' command.

If you invoke BusyBox with no arguments, it will provide you with a list of the
applets that have been compiled into your BusyBox binary.

---

# COMMON OPTIONS

Most BusyBox applets support the **--help** argument to provide a terse runtime
description of their behavior. If the CONFIG\_FEATURE\_VERBOSE\_USAGE option has
been enabled, more detailed usage information will also be available.

# LIBC NSS

GNU Libc (glibc) uses the Name Service Switch (NSS) to configure the behavior
of the C library for the local environment, and to configure how it reads
system data, such as passwords and group information. This is implemented
using an /etc/nsswitch.conf configuration file, and using one or more of the
/lib/libnss\_\* libraries. BusyBox tries to avoid using any libc calls that make
use of NSS. Some applets however, such as login and su, will use libc functions
that require NSS.

If you enable CONFIG\_USE\_BB\_PWD\_GRP, BusyBox will use internal functions to
directly access the /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow files without
using NSS. This may allow you to run your system without the need for
installing any of the NSS configuration files and libraries.

When used with glibc, the BusyBox 'networking' applets will similarly require
that you install at least some of the glibc NSS stuff (in particular,
/etc/nsswitch.conf, /lib/libnss\_dns\*, /lib/libnss\_files\*, and /lib/libresolv\*).

Shameless Plug: As an alternative, one could use a C library such as uClibc. In
addition to making your system significantly smaller, uClibc does not require the
use of any NSS support files or libraries.

It has been used in the [7z](/wiki/7z "7z") format of the [7-Zip](/wiki/7-Zip "7-Zip") archiver since 2001.[[1]](#cite_note-7z_format-1) This algorithm uses a [dictionary compression](/wiki/Dictionary_coder "Dictionary coder") scheme somewhat similar to the [LZ77](/wiki/LZ77 "LZ77") algorithm published by [Abraham Lempel](/wiki/Abraham_Lempel "Abraham Lempel") and [Jacob Ziv](/wiki/Jacob_Ziv "Jacob Ziv") in 1977 and features a high compression ratio (generally higher than [bzip2](/wiki/Bzip2 "Bzip2"))[[2]](#cite_note-gzip_bzip_lzma_bench-2)[[3]](#cite_note-3) and a variable compression-dictionary size (up to 4 [GB](/wiki/Gigabyte "Gigabyte")),[[4]](#cite_note-LZMA_Format-4) while still maintaining decompression speed similar to other commonly used compression algorithms.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

**LZMA2** is a simple container format that can include both uncompressed data and LZMA data, possibly with multiple different LZMA encoding parameters. LZMA2 supports arbitrarily scalable multithreaded compression and decompression and efficient compression of data which is partially incompressible.[[6]](#cite_note-xz-inadequate-6)

## Overview

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Overview")]

LZMA uses a [dictionary compression](/wiki/Dictionary_coder "Dictionary coder") algorithm (a variant of [LZ77](/wiki/LZ77 "LZ77") with huge dictionary sizes and special support for repeatedly used match distances), whose output is then encoded with a [range encoder](/wiki/Range_encoding "Range encoding"), using a complex model to make a probability prediction of each bit. The dictionary compressor finds matches using sophisticated dictionary data structures, and produces a stream of literal symbols and phrase references, which is encoded one bit at a time by the range encoder: many encodings are possible, and a [dynamic programming](/wiki/Dynamic_programming "Dynamic programming") algorithm is used to select an optimal one under certain approximations.[[7]](#cite_note-lzma-sdk-format-7)

Prior to LZMA, most encoder models were purely byte-based (i.e. they coded each bit using only a cascade of contexts to represent the dependencies on previous bits from the same byte). The main innovation of LZMA is that instead of a generic byte-based model, LZMA's model uses contexts specific to the bitfields in each representation of a literal or phrase: this is nearly as simple as a generic byte-based model, but gives much better compression because it avoids mixing unrelated bits together in the same context. Furthermore, compared to classic dictionary compression (such as the one used in [zip](/wiki/ZIP_%28file_format%29 "ZIP (file format)") and [gzip](/wiki/Gzip "Gzip") formats), the dictionary sizes can be and usually are much larger, taking advantage of the large amount of memory available on modern systems.[[7]](#cite_note-lzma-sdk-format-7)

## Compressed format overview

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Compressed format overview")]

In LZMA compression, the compressed stream is a stream of bits, encoded using an adaptive binary range coder. The stream is divided into packets, each packet describing either a single byte, or an LZ77 sequence with its length and distance implicitly or explicitly encoded. Each part of each packet is modeled with independent contexts, so the probability predictions for each bit are correlated with the values of that bit (and related bits from the same field) in previous packets of the same type. Both the lzip[[8]](#cite_note-lzip-format-8) and the LZMA SDK documentation describes this stream format.[[7]](#cite_note-lzma-sdk-format-7)

There are 7 types of packets:[[8]](#cite_note-lzip-format-8)

| Packed code (bit sequence) | Packet name | Packet description |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 0 + byteCode | LIT | A single byte encoded using an adaptive binary range coder. |
| 1+0 + len + dist | MATCH | A typical LZ77 sequence describing sequence length and distance. |
| 1+1+0+0 | SHORTREP | A one-byte LZ77 sequence. Distance is equal to the last used LZ77 distance. |
| 1+1+0+1 + len | LONGREP[0] | An LZ77 sequence. Distance is equal to the last used LZ77 distance. |
| 1+1+1+0 + len | LONGREP[1] | An LZ77 sequence. Distance is equal to the second last used LZ77 distance. |
| 1+1+1+1+0 + len | LONGREP[2] | An LZ77 sequence. Distance is equal to the third last used LZ77 distance. |
| 1+1+1+1+1 + len | LONGREP[3] | An LZ77 sequence. Distance is equal to the fourth last used LZ77 distance. |

LONGREP[\*] refers to LONGREP[0–3] packets, \*REP refers to both LONGREP and SHORTREP, and \*MATCH refers to both MATCH and \*REP.

LONGREP[n] packets remove the distance used from the list of the most recent distances and reinsert it at the front, to avoid useless repeated entry, while MATCH just adds the distance to the front even if already present in the list and SHORTREP and LONGREP[0] don't alter the list.

The length is encoded as follows:

| Length code (bit sequence) | Description |
| --- | --- |
| 0+ 3 bits | The length encoded using 3 bits, gives the lengths range from 2 to 9. |
| 1+0+ 3 bits | The length encoded using 3 bits, gives the lengths range from 10 to 17. |
| 1+1+ 8 bits | The length encoded using 8 bits, gives the lengths range from 18 to 273. |

As in LZ77, the length is not limited by the distance, because copying from the dictionary is defined as if the copy was performed byte by byte, keeping the distance constant.

Distances are logically 32-bit and distance 0 points to the most recently added byte in the dictionary.

The distance encoding starts with a 6-bit "distance slot", which determines how many further bits are needed.
Distances are decoded as a binary concatenation of, from most to least significant, two bits depending on the distance slot, some bits encoded with fixed 0.5 probability, and some context encoded bits, according to the following table (distance slots 0−3 directly encode distances 0−3).

Distance encoding[[7]](#cite_note-lzma-sdk-format-7)

| 6-bit distance slot | Highest 2 bits | Fixed 0.5 probability bits | Context encoded bits |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 0 | 00 | 0 | 0 |
| 1 | 01 | 0 | 0 |
| 2 | 10 | 0 | 0 |
| 3 | 11 | 0 | 0 |
| 4 | 10 | 0 | 1 |
| 5 | 11 | 0 | 1 |
| 6 | 10 | 0 | 2 |
| 7 | 11 | 0 | 2 |
| 8 | 10 | 0 | 3 |
| 9 | 11 | 0 | 3 |
| 10 | 10 | 0 | 4 |
| 11 | 11 | 0 | 4 |
| 12 | 10 | 0 | 5 |
| 13 | 11 | 0 | 5 |
| 14–62 (even) | 10 | ((slot / 2) − 5) | 4 |
| 15–63 (odd) | 11 | (((slot − 1) / 2) − 5) | 4 |

No complete natural language specification of the compressed format seems to exist, other than the one attempted in the following text.

The description below is based on the compact [XZ](/wiki/XZ_Utils "XZ Utils") Embedded decoder by Lasse Collin included in the Linux kernel source[[9]](#cite_note-9) from which the LZMA and LZMA2 algorithm details can be relatively easily deduced: thus, while citing source code as reference is not ideal, any programmer should be able to check the claims below with a few hours of work.

### Range coding of bits

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Range coding of bits")]

LZMA data is at the lowest level decoded one bit at a time by the range decoder, at the direction of the LZMA decoder.

Context-based range decoding is invoked by the LZMA algorithm passing it a reference to the "context", which consists of the unsigned 11-bit variable *prob* (typically implemented using a 16-bit data type) representing the predicted probability of the bit being 0, which is read and updated by the range decoder (and should be initialized to ⁠

{\displaystyle 2^{10}}

![{\displaystyle 2^{10}}](https://wikimedia.org/api/rest_v1/media/math/render/svg/fddedb38858e1f60408f26b5eafd229ad1284ed5)⁠, representing 0.5 probability).

Fixed probability range decoding instead assumes a 0.5 probability, but operates slightly differently from context-based range decoding.

The range decoder state consists of two unsigned 32-bit variables, *range* (representing the range size), and *code* (representing the encoded point within the range).

Initialization of the range decoder consists of setting *range* to 232 − 1, and *code* to the 32-bit value starting at the second byte in the stream interpreted as big-endian; the first byte in the stream is completely ignored.

Normalization proceeds in this way:

1. Shift both *range* and *code* left by 8 bits
2. Read a byte from the compressed stream
3. Set the least significant 8 bits of *code* to the byte value read

Context-based range decoding of a bit using the *prob* probability variable proceeds in this way:

3. If *code* is less than *range*:
   1. Return bit 0
4. Otherwise (if *code* is greater or equal than *range*):
   1. Set *code* to *code* − *range*
   2. Return bit 1

The Linux kernel implementation of fixed-probability decoding in `rc_direct()`, for performance reasons, does not include a conditional branch, but instead subtracts *range* from *code* unconditionally. The resulting sign bit is used to both decide the bit to return and to generate a mask that is combined with *code* and added to *range*.

Note that:

2. Fixed probability decoding is not strictly equivalent to context-based range decoding with any *prob* value, due to the fact that context-based range decoding discards the lower 11 bits of *range* before multiplying by *prob* as just described, while fixed probability decoding only discards the last bit

### Range coding of integers

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Range coding of integers")]

The range decoder also provides the bit-tree, reverse bit-tree and fixed probability integer decoding facilities, which are used to decode integers, and generalize the single-bit decoding described above.
To decode unsigned integers less than *limit*, an array of (*limit* − 1) 11-bit probability variables is provided, which are conceptually arranged as the internal nodes of a complete binary tree with *limit* leaves.

Non-reverse bit-tree decoding works by keeping a pointer to the tree of variables, which starts at the root. As long as the pointer does not point to a leaf, a bit is decoded using the variable indicated by the pointer, and the pointer is moved to either the left or right children depending on whether the bit is 0 or 1; when the pointer points to a leaf, the number associated with the leaf is returned.

Non-reverse bit-tree decoding thus happens from most significant to least significant bit, stopping when only one value in the valid range is possible (this conceptually allows to have range sizes that are not powers of two, even though LZMA does not make use of this).

Reverse bit-tree decoding instead decodes from least significant bit to most significant bits, and thus only supports ranges that are powers of two, and always decodes the same number of bits. It is equivalent to performing non-reverse bittree decoding with a power of two *limit*, and reversing the last log2(*limit*) bits of the result.

In the rc\_bittree function in the Linux kernel, integers are actually returned in the [*limit*, 2 × *limit*) range (with *limit* added to the conceptual value), and the variable at index 0 in the array is unused, while the one at index 1 is the root, and the left and right children indices are computed as 2*i* and 2*i* + 1. The rc\_bittree\_reverse function instead adds integers in the [0, *limit*) range to a caller-provided variable, where *limit* is implicitly represented by its logarithm, and has its own independent implementation for efficiency reasons.

Fixed probability integer decoding simply performs fixed probability bit decoding repeatedly, reading bits from the most to the least significant.

### LZMA configuration

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: LZMA configuration")]

The LZMA decoder is configured by an *lclppb* "properties" byte and a dictionary size. The value of the *lclppb* byte is *lc* + *lp* × 9 + *pb* × 9 × 5, where:

* *lc* is the number of high bits of the previous byte to use as a context for literal encoding (the default value used by the LZMA SDK is 3)
* *lp* is the number of low bits of the dictionary position to include in *literal\_pos\_state* (the default value used by the LZMA SDK is 0)
* *pb* is the number of low bits of the dictionary position to include in *pos\_state* (the default value used by the LZMA SDK is 2)

In non-LZMA2 streams, *lc* must not be greater than 8, and *lp* and *pb* must not be greater than 4.
In LZMA2 streams, (*lc* + *lp*) and *pb* must not be greater than 4.

In the 7-zip LZMA file format, configuration is performed by a header containing the "properties" byte followed by the 32-bit little-endian dictionary size in bytes. In LZMA2, the properties byte can optionally be changed at the start of LZMA2 LZMA packets, while the dictionary size is specified in the LZMA2 header as later described.

### LZMA coding contexts

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm&action=edit&section=7 "Edit section: LZMA coding contexts")]

The LZMA packet format has already been described, and this section specifies how LZMA statistically models the LZ-encoded streams, or in other words which probability variables are passed to the range decoder to decode each bit.

Those probability variables are implemented as multi-dimensional arrays; before introducing them, a few values that are used as indices in these multidimensional arrays are defined.

The *state* value is conceptually based on which of the patterns in the following table match the latest 2–4 packet types seen, and is implemented as a state machine state updated according to the transition table listed in the table every time a packet is output.

The initial state is 0, and thus packets before the beginning are assumed to be LIT packets.

| state | previous packets | | | | next state when next packet is | | | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | 4th previous | 3rd previous | 2nd previous | previous | LIT | MATCH | LONGREP[\*] | SHORTREP |
| 0 |  | LIT | LIT | LIT | 0 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| 1 |  | MATCH | LIT | LIT | 0 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| 2 |  | LONGREP[\*] | LIT | LIT | 0 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| \*MATCH | SHORTREP |
| 3 | LIT | SHORTREP | LIT | LIT | 0 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| 4 |  |  | MATCH | LIT | 1 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| 5 |  |  | LONGREP[\*] | LIT | 2 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| \*MATCH | SHORTREP |
| 6 |  | LIT | SHORTREP | LIT | 3 | 7 | 8 | 9 |
| 7 |  |  | LIT | MATCH | 4 | 10 | 11 | 11 |
| 8 |  |  | LIT | LONGREP[\*] | 5 | 10 | 11 | 11 |
| 9 |  |  | LIT | SHORTREP | 6 | 10 | 11 | 11 |
| 10 |  |  | \*MATCH | MATCH | 4 | 10 | 11 | 11 |
| 11 |  |  | \*MATCH | \*REP | 5 | 10 | 11 | 11 |

The *pos\_state* and *literal\_pos\_state* values consist of respectively the *pb* and *lp* (up to 4, from the LZMA header or LZMA2 properties packet) least significant bits of the dictionary position (the number of bytes coded since the last dictionary reset modulo the dictionary size). Note that the dictionary size is normally the multiple of a large power of 2, so these values are equivalently described as the least significant bits of the number of uncompressed bytes seen since the last dictionary reset.

The *prev\_byte\_lc\_msbs* value is set to the *lc* (up to 4, from the LZMA header or LZMA2 properties packet) most significant bits of the previous uncompressed byte.

The *is\_REP* value denotes whether a packet that includes a length is a LONGREP rather than a MATCH.

The *match\_byte* value is the byte that would have been decoded if a SHORTREP packet had been used (in other words, the byte found at the dictionary at the last used distance); it is only used just after a \*MATCH packet.

*literal\_bit\_mode* is an array of 8 values in the 0–2 range, one for each bit position in a byte, which are 1 or 2 if the previous packet was a \*MATCH and it is either the most significant bit position or all the more significant bits in the literal to encode/decode are equal to the bits in the corresponding positions in *match\_byte*, while otherwise it is 0; the choice between the 1 or 2 values depends on the value of the bit at the same position in *match\_byte*.

The literal/Literal set of variables can be seen as a "pseudo-bit-tree" similar to a bit-tree but with 3 variables instead of 1 in every node, chosen depending on the *literal\_bit\_mode* value at the bit position of the next bit to decode after the bit-tree context denoted by the node.

The claim, found in some sources, that literals after a \*MATCH are coded as the XOR of the byte value with *match\_byte* is incorrect; they are instead coded simply as their byte value, but using the pseudo-bit-tree just described and the additional context listed in the table below.

The probability variable groups used in LZMA are those:

| XZ name | LZMA SDK name | Parameterized by | Used when | Coding mode | If bit 0 then | If bit 1 then |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| is\_match | IsMatch | *state*, *pos\_state* | packet start | bit | LIT | \*MATCH |
| is\_rep | IsRep | *state* | after bit sequence 1 | bit | MATCH | \*REP |
| is\_rep0 | IsRepG0 | *state* | after bit sequence 11 | bit | SHORTREP/ LONGREP[0] | LONGREP[1–3] |
| is\_rep0\_long | IsRep0Long | *state*, *pos\_state* | after bit sequence 110 | bit | SHORTREP | LONGREP[0] |
| is\_rep1 | IsRepG1 | *state* | after bit sequence 111 | bit | LONGREP[1] | LONGREP[2/3] |
| is\_rep2 | IsRepG2 | *state* | after bit sequence 1111 | bit | LONGREP[2] | LONGREP[3] |
| literal | Literal | *prev\_byte\_lc\_msbs*, *literal\_pos\_state*, *literal\_bit\_mode*[bit position], bit-tree context | after bit sequence 0 | 256 values pseudo-bit-tree | literal byte value | |
| dist\_slot | PosSlot | min(*match\_length*, 5), bit-tree context | distance: start | 64 values bit-tree | distance slot | |
| dist\_special | SpecPos | *distance\_slot*, reverse bit-tree context | distance: 4–13 distance slots | ((*distance\_slot* >> 1) − 1)-bit reverse bit-tree | low bits of distance | |
| dist\_align | Align | reverse bit-tree context | distance: 14+ distance slots, after fixed probability bits | 4-bit reverse bit-tree | low bits of distance | |
| len\_dec.choice | LenChoice | *is\_REP* | match length: start | bit | 2–9 length | 10+ length |
| len\_dec.choice2 | LenChoice2 | *is\_REP* | match length: after bit sequence 1 | bit | 10–17 length | 18+ length |
| len\_dec.low | LenLow | *is\_REP*, *pos\_state*, bit-tree context | match length: after bit sequence 0 | 8 values bit-tree | low bits of length | |
| len\_dec.mid | LenMid | *is\_REP*, *pos\_state*, bit-tree context | match length: after bit sequence 10 | 8 values bit-tree | middle bits of length | |
| len\_dec.high | LenHigh | *is\_REP*, bit-tree context | match length: after bit sequence 11 | 256 values bit-tree | high bits of length | |

### LZMA2 format

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm&action=edit&section=8 "Edit section: LZMA2 format")]

The LZMA2 container supports multiple runs of compressed LZMA data and uncompressed data. Each LZMA compressed run can have a different LZMA configuration and dictionary. This improves the compression of partially or completely incompressible files and allows multithreaded compression and multithreaded decompression by breaking the file into runs that can be compressed or decompressed independently in parallel.
Criticism of LZMA2's changes over LZMA include header fields not being covered by CRCs,
and parallel decompression not being possible in practice.[[6]](#cite_note-xz-inadequate-6)

The LZMA2 header consists of a byte indicating the dictionary size:

* 40 indicates a 4 GB − 1 dictionary size
* Even values less than 40 indicate a 2*v*/2 + 12 bytes dictionary size
* Odd values less than 40 indicate a 3×2(*v* − 1)/2 + 11 bytes dictionary size
* Values higher than 40 are invalid

LZMA2 data consists of packets starting with a control byte, with the following values:

* 0 denotes the end of the file
* 1 denotes a dictionary reset followed by an uncompressed chunk
* 2 denotes an uncompressed chunk without a dictionary reset
* 3–0x7f are invalid values
* 0x80–0xff denotes an LZMA chunk, where the lowest 5 bits are used as bit 16–20 of the uncompressed size minus one, and bit 5–6 indicates what should be reset

Bits 5–6 for LZMA chunks can be:

* 0: nothing reset
* 1: state reset
* 2: state reset, properties reset using properties byte
* 3: state reset, properties reset using properties byte, dictionary reset

LZMA state resets cause a reset of all LZMA state except the dictionary, and specifically:

* The range coder
* The *state* value
* The last distances for repeated matches
* All LZMA probabilities

Uncompressed chunks consist of:

* A 16-bit big-endian value encoding the data size minus one
* The data to be copied verbatim into the dictionary and the output

LZMA chunks consist of:

* A 16-bit big-endian value encoding the low 16 bits of the uncompressed size minus one
* A 16-bit big-endian value encoding the compressed size minus one
* A properties/lclppb byte if bit 6 in the control byte is set
* The LZMA compressed data, starting with the 5 bytes (of which the first is ignored) used to initialize the range coder (which are included in the compressed size)

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm&action=edit&section=10 "Edit section: 7-Zip reference implementation")]

The LZMA implementation extracted from [7-Zip](/wiki/7-Zip "7-Zip") is available as LZMA SDK. It was originally dual-licensed under both the [GNU LGPL](/wiki/GNU_Lesser_General_Public_License "GNU Lesser General Public License") and [Common Public License](/wiki/Common_Public_License "Common Public License"),[[12]](#cite_note-12) with an additional special exception for linked binaries, but was placed by [Igor Pavlov](/wiki/Igor_Pavlov_%28programmer%29 "Igor Pavlov (programmer)") in the [public domain](/wiki/Public_domain "Public domain") on December 2, 2008, with the release of version 4.62.[[11]](#cite_note-LZMA_SDK-11)

LZMA2 compression, which is an improved version of LZMA,[[13]](#cite_note-13) is now the default compression method for the .7z format, starting with version 9.30 on October 26, 2012.[[14]](#cite_note-14)

The reference [open source](/wiki/Open-source_license "Open-source license") LZMA compression library was originally written in [C++](/wiki/C%2B%2B "C++") but has been ported to [ANSI C](/wiki/C_%28programming_language%29 "C (programming language)"), [C#](/wiki/C_Sharp_%28programming_language%29 "C Sharp (programming language)"), and [Java](/wiki/Java_%28programming_language%29 "Java (programming language)").[[11]](#cite_note-LZMA_SDK-11) There are also third-party [Python](/wiki/Python_%28programming_language%29 "Python (programming language)") bindings for the C++ library, as well as ports of LZMA to [Pascal](/wiki/Pascal_%28programming_language%29 "Pascal (programming language)"), [Go](/wiki/Go_%28programming_language%29 "Go (programming language)") and [Ada](/wiki/Ada_%28programming_language%29 "Ada (programming language)").[[15]](#cite_note-15)[[16]](#cite_note-16)[[17]](#cite_note-17)[[18]](#cite_note-18)

The 7-Zip implementation uses several variants of [hash chains](/wiki/Hash_chain "Hash chain"), [binary trees](/wiki/Binary_tree "Binary tree") and [Patricia trees](/wiki/Patricia_tree "Patricia tree") as the basis for its dictionary search algorithm.

In addition to LZMA, the SDK and 7-Zip also implements multiple [preprocessing filters](/wiki/7z#Pre-processing_filters "7z") intended to improve compression, ranging from simple [delta encoding](/wiki/Delta_encoding "Delta encoding") (for images) and BCJ for executable code. It also provides some other compression algorithms used in 7z.

Decompression-only code for LZMA generally compiles to around 5 KB, and the amount of RAM required during decompression is principally determined by the size of the [sliding window](/wiki/Sliding_window "Sliding window") used during compression. Small code size and relatively low memory overhead, particularly with smaller dictionary lengths, and free source code make the LZMA decompression algorithm well-suited to [embedded](/wiki/Embedded_system "Embedded system") applications.

## Other implementations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm&action=edit&section=11 "Edit section: Other implementations")]

In addition to the 7-Zip reference implementation, the following support the LZMA format.

* [xz](/wiki/XZ_Utils "XZ Utils"): a streaming implementation that contains a [gzip](/wiki/Gzip "Gzip")-like command line tool, supporting both LZMA and LZMA2 in its xz file format. It made its way into several software of the [Unix-like](/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") world with its high performance (compared to [bzip2](/wiki/Bzip2 "Bzip2")) and small size (compared to [gzip](/wiki/Gzip "Gzip")).[[2]](#cite_note-gzip_bzip_lzma_bench-2) The [Linux kernel](/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel"), [dpkg](/wiki/Dpkg "Dpkg") and [RPM](/wiki/RPM_Package_Manager "RPM Package Manager") systems contains xz code, and many software distributors like [kernel.org](/wiki/Linux_kernel "Linux kernel"), [Debian](/wiki/Debian "Debian")[[19]](#cite_note-dpkg_use_xz-19) and [Fedora](/wiki/Fedora_%28operating_system%29 "Fedora (operating system)") now use xz for compressing their releases.
* [lzip](/wiki/Lzip "Lzip"): another LZMA implementation mostly for Unix-like systems to be directly competing with xz.[[20]](#cite_note-lzip_bench-20) It mainly features a simpler file format and therefore easier error recovery.
* [ZIPX](/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29 "Zip (file format)"): an extension to the [ZIP](/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29 "Zip (file format)") compressions format that was created by [WinZip](/wiki/WinZip "WinZip") starting with version 12.1. It also can use various other compression methods such as [BZip](/wiki/Bzip2 "Bzip2") and [PPMd](/wiki/Prediction_by_partial_matching "Prediction by partial matching").[[21]](#cite_note-zipx-21)

## LZHAM

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm&action=edit&section=12 "Edit section: LZHAM")]

LZHAM (LZ, Huffman, Arithmetic, Markov), is an LZMA-like implementation that trades compression throughput for very high ratios and higher decompression throughput. It was placed by its author in the [public domain](/wiki/Public_domain "Public domain") on 15 September 2020.[[22]](#cite_note-22)

Lossless data compression algorithms

**LZ77** and **LZ78** are the two [lossless data compression](/wiki/Lossless_data_compression "Lossless data compression") [algorithms](/wiki/Algorithm "Algorithm") published in papers by [Abraham Lempel](/wiki/Abraham_Lempel "Abraham Lempel") and [Jacob Ziv](/wiki/Jacob_Ziv "Jacob Ziv") in 1977[[1]](#cite_note-1) and 1978.[[2]](#cite_note-2)
They are also known as **Lempel-Ziv 1** (LZ1) and **Lempel-Ziv 2** (LZ2) respectively.[[3]](#cite_note-3) These two algorithms form the basis for many variations including [LZW](/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch "Lempel–Ziv–Welch"), [LZSS](/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Storer%E2%80%93Szymanski "Lempel–Ziv–Storer–Szymanski"), [LZMA](/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm "Lempel–Ziv–Markov chain algorithm") and others. Besides their academic influence, these algorithms formed the basis of several ubiquitous compression schemes, including [GIF](/wiki/GIF "GIF") and the [DEFLATE](/wiki/DEFLATE "DEFLATE") algorithm used in [PNG](/wiki/Portable_Network_Graphics "Portable Network Graphics") and [ZIP](/wiki/Zip_%28file_format%29 "Zip (file format)").

They are both theoretically [dictionary coders](/wiki/Dictionary_coder "Dictionary coder"). LZ77 maintains a sliding window during compression. This was later shown to be equivalent to the *explicit dictionary* constructed by LZ78—however, they are only equivalent when the entire data is intended to be decompressed.

Since LZ77 encodes and decodes from a sliding window over previously seen characters, decompression must always start at the beginning of the input. Conceptually, LZ78 decompression could allow random access to the input if the entire dictionary were known in advance. However, in practice the dictionary is created during encoding and decoding by creating a new phrase whenever a token is output.[[4]](#cite_note-4)

The algorithms were named an [IEEE Milestone](/wiki/List_of_IEEE_milestones "List of IEEE milestones") in 2004.[[5]](#cite_note-5) In 2021 Jacob Ziv was awarded the [IEEE Medal of Honor](/wiki/IEEE_Medal_of_Honor "IEEE Medal of Honor") for his involvement in their development.[[6]](#cite_note-6)

## Theoretical efficiency

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=LZ77_and_LZ78&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Theoretical efficiency")]

In the second of the two papers that introduced these algorithms they are analyzed as encoders defined by finite-state machines. A measure analogous to [information entropy](/wiki/Information_entropy "Information entropy") is developed for individual sequences (as opposed to probabilistic ensembles). This measure gives a bound on the [data compression ratio](/wiki/Data_compression_ratio "Data compression ratio") that can be achieved. It is then shown that there exists finite lossless encoders for every sequence that achieve this bound as the length of the sequence grows to infinity. In this sense an algorithm based on this scheme produces asymptotically optimal encodings. This result can be proven more directly, as for example in notes by [Peter Shor](/wiki/Peter_Shor "Peter Shor").[[7]](#cite_note-7)

Formally, (Theorem 13.5.2 [[8]](#cite_note-8)).

Similar theorems apply to other versions of LZ algorithm.

## LZ77

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=LZ77_and_LZ78&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: LZ77")]

LZ77 algorithms achieve compression by replacing repeated occurrences of data with references to a single copy of that data existing earlier in the uncompressed data stream. A match is encoded by a pair of numbers called a *length-distance pair*, which is equivalent to the statement "each of the next *length* characters is equal to the characters exactly *distance* characters behind it in the uncompressed stream". (The *distance* is sometimes called the *offset* instead.)

To spot matches, the encoder must keep track of some amount of the most recent data, such as the last 2 [KB](/wiki/Kilobyte "Kilobyte"), 4 KB, or 32 KB. The structure in which this data is held is called a *sliding window*, which is why LZ77 is sometimes called *sliding-window compression*. The encoder needs to keep this data to look for matches, and the decoder needs to keep this data to interpret the matches the encoder refers to. The larger the sliding window is, the longer back the encoder may search for creating references.

It is not only acceptable but frequently useful to allow length-distance pairs to specify a length that actually exceeds the distance. As a copy command, this is puzzling: "Go back *four* characters and copy *ten* characters from that position into the current position". How can ten characters be copied over when only four of them are actually in the buffer? Tackling one byte at a time, there is no problem serving this request, because as a byte is copied over, it may be fed again as input to the copy command. When the copy-from position makes it to the initial destination position, it is consequently fed data that was pasted from the *beginning* of the copy-from position. The operation is thus equivalent to the statement "copy the data you were given and repetitively paste it until it fits". As this type of pair repeats a single copy of data multiple times, it can be used to incorporate a flexible and easy form of [run-length encoding](/wiki/Run-length_encoding "Run-length encoding").

Another way to see things is as follows: While encoding, for the search pointer to continue finding matched pairs past the end of the search window, all characters from the first match at offset *D* and forward to the end of the search window must have matched input, and these are the (previously seen) characters that compose a single run unit of length *L*R, which must equal *D*. Then as the search pointer proceeds past the search window and forward, as far as the run pattern repeats in the input, the search and input pointers will be in sync and match characters until the run pattern is interrupted. Then *L* characters have been matched in total, *L* > *D*, and the code is [*D*, *L*, *c*].

Upon decoding [*D*, *L*, *c*], again, *D* = *L*R. When the first *L*R characters are read to the output, this corresponds to a single run unit appended to the output buffer. At this point, the read pointer could be thought of as only needing to return int(*L*/*L*R) + (1 if *L* mod *L*R ≠ 0) times to the start of that single buffered run unit, read *L*R characters (or maybe fewer on the last return), and repeat until a total of *L* characters are read. But mirroring the encoding process, since the pattern is repetitive, the read pointer need only trail in sync with the write pointer by a fixed distance equal to the run length *L*R until *L* characters have been copied to output in total.

Considering the above, especially if the compression of data runs is expected to predominate, the window search should begin at the end of the window and proceed backwards, since run patterns, if they exist, will be found first and allow the search to terminate, absolutely if the current maximal matching sequence length is met, or judiciously, if a sufficient length is met, and finally for the simple possibility that the data is more recent and may correlate better with the next input.

### Pseudocode

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=LZ77_and_LZ78&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Pseudocode")]

The following pseudocode is a reproduction of the LZ77 compression algorithm sliding window.

```
while input is not empty do
    match := longest repeated occurrence of input that begins in window

    if match exists then
        d := distance to start of match
        l := length of match
        c := char following match in input
    else
        d := 0
        l := 0
        c := first char of input
    end if

    output (d, l, c)

    discard l + 1 chars from front of window
    s := pop l + 1 chars from front of input
    append s to back of window
repeat

```
### Implementations

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=LZ77_and_LZ78&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: Implementations")]

Even though all LZ77 algorithms work by definition on the same basic principle, they can vary widely in how they encode their compressed data to vary the numerical ranges of a length–distance pair, alter the number of bits consumed for a length–distance pair, and distinguish their length–distance pairs from *literals* (raw data encoded as itself, rather than as part of a length–distance pair). A few examples:

* The algorithm illustrated in Lempel and Ziv's original 1977 article outputs all its data three values at a time: the length and distance of the longest match found in the buffer, and the literal that followed that match. If two successive characters in the input stream could be encoded only as literals, the length of the length–distance pair would be 0.
* [LZSS](/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Storer%E2%80%93Szymanski "Lempel–Ziv–Storer–Szymanski") improves on LZ77 by using a 1-bit flag to indicate whether the next chunk of data is a literal or a length–distance pair, and using literals if a length–distance pair would be longer.
* In the PalmDoc format, a length–distance pair is always encoded by a two-byte sequence. Of the 16 bits that make up these two bytes, 11 bits go to encoding the distance, 3 go to encoding the length, and the remaining two are used to make sure the decoder can identify the first byte as the beginning of such a two-byte sequence.
* In the implementation used for many games by [Electronic Arts](/wiki/Electronic_Arts "Electronic Arts"),[[9]](#cite_note-9) the size in bytes of a length–distance pair can be specified inside the first byte of the length–distance pair itself; depending on whether the first byte begins with a 0, 10, 110, or 111 (when read in [big-endian](/wiki/Endianness "Endianness") bit orientation), the length of the entire length–distance pair can be 1 to 4 bytes.
* As of 2008[[update]](https://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=LZ77_and_LZ78&action=edit), the most popular LZ77-based compression method is [DEFLATE](/wiki/DEFLATE "DEFLATE"); it combines LZSS with [Huffman coding](/wiki/Huffman_coding "Huffman coding").[[10]](#cite_note-10) Literals, lengths, and a symbol to indicate the end of the current block of data are all placed together into one alphabet. Distances can be safely placed into a separate alphabet; because a distance only occurs just after a length, it cannot be mistaken for another kind of symbol or vice versa.

## LZ78

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=LZ77_and_LZ78&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: LZ78")]

The LZ78 algorithms compress sequential data by building a dictionary of token sequences from the input, and then replacing the second and subsequent occurrence of the sequence in the data stream with a reference to the dictionary entry. The observation is that the number of repeated sequences is a good measure of the non random nature of a sequence. The algorithms represent the dictionary as an n-ary tree where n is the number of tokens used to form token sequences. Each dictionary entry is of the form `dictionary[...] = {index, token}`, where index is the index to a dictionary entry representing a previously seen sequence, and token is the next token from the input that makes this entry unique in the dictionary. Note how the algorithm is greedy, and so nothing is added to the table until a unique making token is found. The algorithm is to initialize last matching index = 0 and next available index = 1 and then, for each token of the input stream, the dictionary searched for a match: `{last matching index, token}`. If a match is found, then last matching index is set to the index of the matching entry, nothing is output, and last matching index is left representing the input so far. Input is processed until a match is *not* found. Then a new dictionary entry is created, `dictionary[next available index] = {last matching index, token}`, and the algorithm outputs last matching index, followed by token, then resets last matching index = 0 and increments next available index. As an example consider the sequence of tokens `AABBA` which would assemble the dictionary;

```
0 {0,_}
1 {0,A}
2 {1,B}
3 {0,B}
```

and the output sequence of the compressed data would be `0A1B0B`. Note that the last A is not represented yet as the algorithm cannot know what comes next. In practice an EOF marker is added to the input – `AABBA$` for example. Note also that in this case the output `0A1B0B1$` is longer than the original input but compression ratio improves considerably as the dictionary grows, and in binary the indexes need not be represented by any more than the minimum number of bits.[[11]](#cite_note-11)

Decompression consists of rebuilding the dictionary from the compressed sequence. From the sequence `0A1B0B1$` the first entry is always the terminator `0 {...}` , and the first from the sequence would be `1 {0,A}` . The `A` is added to the output. The second pair from the input is `1B` and results in entry number 2 in the dictionary, `{1,B}`. The token "B" is output, preceded by the sequence represented by dictionary entry 1. Entry 1 is an 'A' (followed by "entry 0" – nothing) so `AB` is added to the output. Next `0B` is added to the dictionary as the next entry, `3 {0,B}` , and B (preceded by nothing) is added to the output. Finally a dictionary entry for `1$` is created and `A$` is output resulting in `A AB B A$` or `AABBA` removing the spaces and EOF marker.

## LZW

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=LZ77_and_LZ78&action=edit&section=6 "Edit section: LZW")]

[LZW](/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch "Lempel–Ziv–Welch") is an LZ78-based algorithm that uses a dictionary pre-initialized with all possible characters (symbols) or emulation of a pre-initialized dictionary. The main improvement of [LZW](/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch "Lempel–Ziv–Welch") is that when a match is not found, the current input stream character is assumed to be the first character of an existing string in the dictionary (since the dictionary is initialized with all possible characters), so only the *last matching index* is output (which may be the pre-initialized dictionary index corresponding to the previous (or the initial) input character). Refer to the [LZW](/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Welch "Lempel–Ziv–Welch") article for implementation details.

[BTLZ](/w/index.php?title=BTLZ&action=edit&redlink=1 "BTLZ (page does not exist)") is an LZ78-based algorithm that was developed for use in real-time communications systems (originally modems) and standardized by CCITT/ITU as [V.42bis](/wiki/V.42bis "V.42bis"). When the [trie](/wiki/Trie "Trie")-structured dictionary is full, a simple re-use/recovery algorithm is used to ensure that the dictionary can keep adapting to changing data. A counter cycles through the dictionary. When a new entry is needed, the counter steps through the dictionary until a leaf node is found (a node with no dependents). This is deleted and the space re-used for the new entry. This is simpler to implement than LRU or LFU and achieves equivalent performance.

# NAME

BusyBox - The Swiss Army Knife of Embedded Linux

---

# SYNTAX

```

 busybox <applet> [arguments...]  # or
```
```

 <applet> [arguments...]          # if symlinked
```

---

# DESCRIPTION

BusyBox combines tiny versions of many common UNIX utilities into a single
small executable. It provides minimalist replacements for most of the utilities
you usually find in GNU coreutils, util-linux, etc. The utilities in BusyBox
generally have fewer options than their full-featured GNU cousins; however, the
options that are included provide the expected functionality and behave very
much like their GNU counterparts.

BusyBox has been written with size-optimization and limited resources in mind.
It is also extremely modular so you can easily include or exclude commands (or
features) at compile time. This makes it easy to customize your embedded
systems. To create a working system, just add /dev, /etc, and a Linux kernel.
BusyBox provides a fairly complete POSIX environment for any small or embedded
system.

BusyBox is extremely configurable. This allows you to include only the
components you need, thereby reducing binary size. Run 'make config' or 'make
menuconfig' to select the functionality that you wish to enable. Then run
'make' to compile BusyBox using your configuration.

After the compile has finished, you should use 'make install' to install
BusyBox. This will install the 'bin/busybox' binary, in the target directory
specified by CONFIG\_PREFIX. CONFIG\_PREFIX can be set when configuring BusyBox,
or you can specify an alternative location at install time (i.e., with a
command line like 'make CONFIG\_PREFIX=/tmp/foo install'). If you enabled
any applet installation scheme (either as symlinks or hardlinks), these will
also be installed in the location pointed to by CONFIG\_PREFIX.

---

# USAGE

BusyBox is a multi-call binary. A multi-call binary is an executable program
that performs the same job as more than one utility program. That means there
is just a single BusyBox binary, but that single binary acts like a large
number of utilities. This allows BusyBox to be smaller since all the built-in
utility programs (we call them applets) can share code for many common
operations.

You can also invoke BusyBox by issuing a command as an argument on the
command line. For example, entering

```

        /bin/busybox ls
```

will also cause BusyBox to behave as 'ls'.

Of course, adding '/bin/busybox' into every command would be painful. So most
people will invoke BusyBox using links to the BusyBox binary.

For example, entering

```

        ln -s /bin/busybox ls
        ./ls
```

will cause BusyBox to behave as 'ls' (if the 'ls' command has been compiled
into BusyBox). Generally speaking, you should never need to make all these
links yourself, as the BusyBox build system will do this for you when you run
the 'make install' command.

If you invoke BusyBox with no arguments, it will provide you with a list of the
applets that have been compiled into your BusyBox binary.

---

# COMMON OPTIONS

Most BusyBox applets support the **--help** argument to provide a terse runtime
description of their behavior. If the CONFIG\_FEATURE\_VERBOSE\_USAGE option has
been enabled, more detailed usage information will also be available.

# LIBC NSS

GNU Libc (glibc) uses the Name Service Switch (NSS) to configure the behavior
of the C library for the local environment, and to configure how it reads
system data, such as passwords and group information. This is implemented
using an /etc/nsswitch.conf configuration file, and using one or more of the
/lib/libnss\_\* libraries. BusyBox tries to avoid using any libc calls that make
use of NSS. Some applets however, such as login and su, will use libc functions
that require NSS.

If you enable CONFIG\_USE\_BB\_PWD\_GRP, BusyBox will use internal functions to
directly access the /etc/passwd, /etc/group, and /etc/shadow files without
using NSS. This may allow you to run your system without the need for
installing any of the NSS configuration files and libraries.

When used with glibc, the BusyBox 'networking' applets will similarly require
that you install at least some of the glibc NSS stuff (in particular,
/etc/nsswitch.conf, /lib/libnss\_dns\*, /lib/libnss\_files\*, and /lib/libresolv\*).

Shameless Plug: As an alternative, one could use a C library such as uClibc. In
addition to making your system significantly smaller, uClibc does not require the
use of any NSS support files or libraries.

![Unboxing BusyBox: 14 Vulnerabilities Uncovered by Claroty, JFrog](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy82MzI3NDc1OWM0MDI1YWU5ZjgwMzI3MDYzZWNkNzY1YS1idXN5Ym94LWFsdC5wbmc=/63274759c4025ae9f80327063ecd765a-busybox-alt.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&w=800&h=450&s=e05200da22c28a633e9abd3c3d513b78)

## Executive Summary

* Team82 and researchers from JFrog collaborated to research the security of BusyBox, a suite of Linux utilities used in IT use cases, as well as OT and IoT
* Many popular PLCs, HMIs, and RTUs run on Linux and have BusyBox utilities running under the hood.
* Our combined research uncovered 14 vulnerabilities affecting current versions of BusyBox, which was updated in version 1.34.0
* Most of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to disrupt services, causing a denial of service condition.
* In some cases, information leaks or remote code execution is possible.
* As part of this research, Team82 is making freely available the [custom AFL fuzzing harnesses](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing) used in this research.

## What is BusyBox?

Embedded devices with limited memory and storage resources are likely to leverage a tool such as [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/), which is marketed as the Swiss Army Knife of embedded Linux. BusyBox is a software suite of many useful Unix utilities, known as applets, that are packaged as a single executable file. Within BusyBox you can find a full fledged shell, a DHCP client/server, and small utilities such as cp, ls, grep, and others. You're also likely to find many OT and IoT devices running BusyBox, including popular programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and remote terminal units (RTUs)—many of which now run on Linux.

As part of our commitment to [improving open-source software security](https://www.wwnytv.com/prnewswire/2021/10/13/entry-level-kubernetes-certification-help-advance-cloud-careers/), Claroty's Team82 and JFrog collaborated on a vulnerability research project examining BusyBox. Using static and dynamic techniques, Claroty's Team82 and JFrog discovered 14 vulnerabilities affecting the latest version of BusyBox. All vulnerabilities were privately disclosed and fixed by BusyBox in [version 1.34.0, which was released Aug. 19](https://busybox.net/).

In most cases, the expected impact of these issues is denial of service (DoS). However, in rarer cases, these issues can also lead to information leaks and possibly remote code execution.

In this report, we will provide details about the vulnerabilities, elaborate on who is affected, discuss our research methodology, explain one of the vulnerabilities in depth, and suggest fixes and workarounds for these issues.

In addition to disclosing the vulnerabilities, Team82 is also open-sourcing its [custom AFL fuzzing harnesses](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing), which were responsible for triggering many of the mentioned vulnerabilities. Hopefully this will help fellow researchers find and disclose even more issues.

## Discovered Vulnerabilities in BusyBox

![BusyBox Discovered Vulnerabilities](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9lMmMwNmRjYTU2MTUyNGM0YTA4YWZkYzUzYWM5YTg1MS1CdXN5Qm94X1RhYmxlLTEtOTgzeDEwMjQuanBn/e2c06dca561524c4a08afdc53ac9a851-BusyBox_Table-1-983x1024.jpg?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=3e25f1f3314d5109764230141d604b37)
### Triggering the Vulnerabilities

Since the affected applets are not daemons, each vulnerability can only be exploited if the vulnerable applet is fed with untrusted data (usually through a command-line argument). Specifically, these are the conditions that must occur for each vulnerability to be triggered:

#### [CVE-2021-42373:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42373)

Applies if the attacker can control all parameters passed to man.
man is built by the default BusyBox configuration, but not shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42374:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42374)

Applies if the attacker can supply a crafted compressed file, that will be decompressed by using unlzma.
Note that even if the unlzma applet is not available, but CONFIG\_FEATURE\_SEAMLESS\_LZMA (enabled by default) is enabled, other applets such as tar, unzip, rpm, dpkg,lzma and man can also reach the vulnerable code when handling a file with the .lzma filename suffix.
unlzma is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42375:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42375)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to ash that contains the special characters $, {, }, or # .
ash is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42376:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42376)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to hush that contains the special character \x03 (delimiter).
hush is built by the default BusyBox configuration, but not shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42377:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42377)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to hush that contains the special character &.

#### [CVE-2021-42378](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42378), [CVE-2021-42386:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42386)

Applies if the attacker can supply an arbitrary pattern to awk (the pattern is the first positional argument this applet takes).
awk is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

## Research Methodology

To research BusyBox, we used static and dynamic analysis approaches.

First, a manual review of the BusyBox source code was conducted in a top-down approach (following user input up to specific applet handling). We also looked for obvious logical/memory corruption vulnerabilities.

The next approach was fuzzing. We compiled BusyBox with [ASan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer) and implemented an [AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL) harness for each BusyBox applet. Each harness was subsequently optimized by removing unnecessary parts of the code, running multiple fuzzing cycles on the same process [(persistent mode)](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2015/06/new-in-afl-persistent-mode.html), and running multiple fuzzed instances in parallel.

We started from fuzzing all the daemon applets, including HTTP, Telnet, DNS, DHCP, NTP etc. Many code changes were required in order to effectively fuzz network-based input. For example, the main modification we performed was to replace all recv functions with input from STDIN in order to support fuzzed inputs. Similar changes were done when we fuzzed non-server applets as well.

We prepared a couple of examples for each applet and ran hundreds of fuzzed BusyBox instances for a few days. This gave us tens of thousands of crashes to evaluate. We had to create classes of crashes with the same root cause to help reduce the volume of crashes we had in our sample set. Later, we minimized each group representative in order to work with a small subset of unique crash inputs.

To fulfill these tasks, we developed automatic tooling that digested all crash data and classified it based on the crash analysis report which mainly includes the crash stack trace, registers, and assembly code of the relevant code area. For example, we merged cases with similar crash stack traces because they usually had the same problematic root cause.

Finally, we researched each unique crash and minimized its input vector in order to understand the root cause, which allowed us to create a proof-of-concept (PoC) that exploits the vulnerability responsible for the crash. In addition, we tested our PoCs against several BusyBox versions to understand when the bugs were introduced to the source code.

**To summarize, here are the steps we took in our research:**

1. Code Review
2. Fuzzing
3. Reduction and Minimization
4. Triage
5. Proof of Concept
6. Testing Multiple Versions
7. Disclosure

## Guide, Resources for BusyBox Fuzzing

As part of our commitment to the OSS and security communities, we created a simple on-boarding guide detailing how to fuzz BusyBox. The guide is published alongside all of the fuzzing harnesses we wrote as part of our fuzzing efforts. We hope these fuzzing harnesses can be further improved by the community, in order to find and fix even more bugs in BusyBox.

**All materials are available on [Claroty's GitHub page](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing).**

## Threat Analysis

To assess the threat level posed by these vulnerabilities, we inspected JFrog's database of more than 10,000 embedded firmware images (comprised of only publicly available firmware, and not images uploaded to JFrog's Artifactory). We found that 40% of them contained a BusyBox executable file that is linked with one of the affected applets, making these issues extremely widespread among Linux-based embedded firmware.

However, we believe these issues do not currently pose a critical security threat because:

1. While the DoS vulnerabilities are trivial to exploit, the impact is usually mitigated by the fact that applets almost always run as a separate forked process.
2. The information leak vulnerability is nontrivial to exploit (see, next section).
3. The use-after-free vulnerabilities may be exploitable for remote code execution, but currently we did not attempt to create a weaponized exploit for them. In addition, it is quite rare (and inherently unsafe) to process an awk pattern from external input.

## Deep Dive: [CVE-2021-42374](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42374): LZMA OOB Read

### Lempel-Ziv-Markov Chain Algorithm (LZMA) and Range Coding

[LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm) is a compression algorithm that uses dictionary compression, and encodes its output using a range encoder. The dictionary compressor finds matches using sophisticated dictionary data structures, and produces a stream of literal symbols and phrase references, which are encoded one bit at a time by the range encoder, using a complex model to make a probability prediction of each bit.

The compression algorithm encodes the compressed stream as a stream of bits using an adaptive binary range coder. Data is broken into packets, where each packet describes either a single byte, or an LZ77 sequence, with its length and distance implicitly or explicitly encoded.

The .lzma format, below, consists of a 13-byte header followed by the LZMA compressed data. Here is a small example of compressing the string "abc" using LZMA:

![LZMA file format](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9kMDNhZTNhMWFlN2Q1NmVjNDNhNzkwZjE1YmVmYTlkZC1MWk1BLnBuZw==/d03ae3a1ae7d56ec43a790f15befa9dd-LZMA.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ff0e1e34fcf6feed7aed6dcfdd08cfee)

In order to output the decompressed stream, LZMA implementations use a memory buffer that is initialized in the size of the user-provided dictionary size (part of the LZMA header). Once that buffer is filled, it automatically outputs the data thus far, flushes the buffer and starts filling it up again.

## The Vulnerability

The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient size check, below, in the function decompress\_unlzma.c (at line 295) when the state >= LZMA\_NUM\_LIT\_STATES:

![BusyBox Screen](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy83MmZiNWFlZDJjMTE3NjUyYjRjNzU0YmRiNzFlODUxZi1CdXN5Ym94U2NyZWVuLVNob3QxLnBuZw==/72fb5aed2c117652b4c754bdb71e851f-BusyboxScreen-Shot1.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=871614b4e1d8ca01181f87fd19d71b0b)

To trigger the vulnerability and to control the starting offset where we will leak data from, we need to make sure that the following conditions are satisfied:

buffer\_pos = 0
and
rep0 = offset + dict\_size

This way, pos will be equal to -(offset + dict\_size). After adding dict\_size, pos will be -offset and so we could leak memory from our desired offset through match\_byte. The leaked memory will most likely contain pointers which could further assist attackers in their exploitation campaign (ex. by facilitating ASLR bypass).

## Causing an Out-of-Bounds Access

The general idea to exploit this vulnerability is to prepare a specifically crafted LZMA encoded stream, so that when it is decoded, both conditions will be filled and pos will be equal to a negative number -offset. Eventually, the decompressed stream will contain the leaked memory, which will be written to the output steam.

To satisfy the first condition buffer\_pos = 0, we need to make sure our code flow (state >= LZMA\_NUM\_LIT\_STATES) is reached right after the current decompressed buffer stream is flushed and so the buffer pointer position will be 0. We can achieve this by reaching the last iteration, below, of a current match:

![BusyBox Buffer Screen](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy80NDRkMjA2YjNkYWYzYzY2MDgxMTU5OTZlODMwODk5MS1CdXN5Ym94LXNjcmVlbnNob3QyLnBuZw==/444d206b3daf3c6608115996e8308991-Busybox-screenshot2.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=6a65d75f65861c4938c240f7b32a72c4)

The second condition is more difficult to satisfy and requires intimate knowledge of how the LZMA algorithm works. The general idea is to encode a special length in the LZMA bit stream so that when decoded it will be used by the rep0 variable.

To conclude, in order to reach an OOB condition, we need to write some bytes, then use a match to fill the buffer to header.dict\_size and change rep0 to our desired value. Therefore, pos will be equal -offset and we could leak bytes from offset as a reference to the buffer pointer.

## Leaking Bits from Out-of-Bounds Memory

After reading the match\_byte, we will get to this flow, below:

![BusyBox Vulnerability](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9lMjVkYmMwMWRlMmQ0NWYzOWRmNzZmZDMzN2EyMGJjZi1CdXN5Ym94LXNjcmVlbnNob3QzLnBuZw==/e25dbc01de2d45f39df76fd337a20bcf-Busybox-screenshot3.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ee3df1ca72ffcf74de23e3bcdd84f164)

As long as the bits match our match\_byte (the leaked byte), it will be in the loop that reads the probability from prob + 0x100 + bit + mi, but once one bit is not matched, it reads it from prob + mi. We can detect what was the first unmatched bit, by checking if prob + mi was changed by writing more literal bytes, or if the probability was changed and we got a different output. Finally, the leaked bits will get flushed to the decompressed buffer.

## Weaponizing ZIP Files

Although the vulnerability was found in the LZMA decompression algorithm, we found that many applets support an LZMA compression and will try to decompress encoded LZMA streams by default (see section, "Fixes and Workarounds" for the configuration flags governing this behavior). For example, the ubiquitous ZIP format supports LZMA compression as a "type 14" compression.

From an attacker's perspective, ZIP is a much better attack vector because:

* unzip invocations are much more common than direct invocations of unlzma.
* With this attack vector, there are no constraints on the filename that's going to be unzipped (unlike in the tar attack vector, which requires a .lzma suffix).
* The leaked data can be extracted and saved into files that can be later read remotely. For example, this can happen in an embedded web service that permits uploading zip files with media resources, which will get extracted to an accessible location. From there, the attacker could read the leaked memory data.

To test this, we built a small PoC script that generates a weaponized ZIP where one of the files is compressed using LZMA, below:

![Segmentation Fault](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9kYmVlYWE5ZDg4MTc2NTA5YjgwZmZmZTA4MzVhOGM3Yi1MWk1BY29kZS0xMDI0eDUyMS5wbmc=/dbeeaa9d88176509b80fffe0835a8c7b-LZMAcode-1024x521.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ae2d5c26a57ff37701b0b4a42298b9fe)
## Fixes and Workarounds

All 14 vulnerabilities have been fixed in BusyBox 1.34.0 ([direct download link](https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.34.0.tar.bz2)) and users are urged to upgrade.

If upgrading BusyBox is not possible (due to specific version compatibility needs), BusyBox 1.33.1 and earlier versions can be compiled without the vulnerable functionality (applets) as a workaround.

After running make deconfig in BusyBox's source directory (or if reusing a previous configuration), edit the .config file such as:

* man - Comment out CONFIG\_MAN=y
* lzma - Comment out CONFIG\_UNLZMA=y , CONFIG\_FEATURE\_SEAMLESS\_LZMA=y and CONFIG\_FEATURE\_UNZIP\_LZMA=y
* ash - Comment out CONFIG\_ASH=y
* hush - Comment out CONFIG\_HUSH=y
* awk - Comment out CONFIG\_AWK=y

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Denys Vlasenko from BusyBox's development team for validating and fixing all of the above issues in a swift manner for [version 1.34.0](https://busybox.net/).

## Executive Summary

* Team82 and researchers from JFrog collaborated to research the security of BusyBox, a suite of Linux utilities used in IT use cases, as well as OT and IoT
* Many popular PLCs, HMIs, and RTUs run on Linux and have BusyBox utilities running under the hood.
* Our combined research uncovered 14 vulnerabilities affecting current versions of BusyBox, which was updated in version 1.34.0
* Most of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to disrupt services, causing a denial of service condition.
* In some cases, information leaks or remote code execution is possible.
* As part of this research, Team82 is making freely available the [custom AFL fuzzing harnesses](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing) used in this research.

## What is BusyBox?

Embedded devices with limited memory and storage resources are likely to leverage a tool such as [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/), which is marketed as the Swiss Army Knife of embedded Linux. BusyBox is a software suite of many useful Unix utilities, known as applets, that are packaged as a single executable file. Within BusyBox you can find a full fledged shell, a DHCP client/server, and small utilities such as cp, ls, grep, and others. You're also likely to find many OT and IoT devices running BusyBox, including popular programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and remote terminal units (RTUs)—many of which now run on Linux.

As part of our commitment to [improving open-source software security](https://www.wwnytv.com/prnewswire/2021/10/13/entry-level-kubernetes-certification-help-advance-cloud-careers/), Claroty's Team82 and JFrog collaborated on a vulnerability research project examining BusyBox. Using static and dynamic techniques, Claroty's Team82 and JFrog discovered 14 vulnerabilities affecting the latest version of BusyBox. All vulnerabilities were privately disclosed and fixed by BusyBox in [version 1.34.0, which was released Aug. 19](https://busybox.net/).

In most cases, the expected impact of these issues is denial of service (DoS). However, in rarer cases, these issues can also lead to information leaks and possibly remote code execution.

In this report, we will provide details about the vulnerabilities, elaborate on who is affected, discuss our research methodology, explain one of the vulnerabilities in depth, and suggest fixes and workarounds for these issues.

In addition to disclosing the vulnerabilities, Team82 is also open-sourcing its [custom AFL fuzzing harnesses](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing), which were responsible for triggering many of the mentioned vulnerabilities. Hopefully this will help fellow researchers find and disclose even more issues.

## Discovered Vulnerabilities in BusyBox

![BusyBox Discovered Vulnerabilities](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9lMmMwNmRjYTU2MTUyNGM0YTA4YWZkYzUzYWM5YTg1MS1CdXN5Qm94X1RhYmxlLTEtOTgzeDEwMjQuanBn/e2c06dca561524c4a08afdc53ac9a851-BusyBox_Table-1-983x1024.jpg?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=3e25f1f3314d5109764230141d604b37)
### Triggering the Vulnerabilities

Since the affected applets are not daemons, each vulnerability can only be exploited if the vulnerable applet is fed with untrusted data (usually through a command-line argument). Specifically, these are the conditions that must occur for each vulnerability to be triggered:

#### [CVE-2021-42373:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42373)

Applies if the attacker can control all parameters passed to man.
man is built by the default BusyBox configuration, but not shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42374:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42374)

Applies if the attacker can supply a crafted compressed file, that will be decompressed by using unlzma.
Note that even if the unlzma applet is not available, but CONFIG\_FEATURE\_SEAMLESS\_LZMA (enabled by default) is enabled, other applets such as tar, unzip, rpm, dpkg,lzma and man can also reach the vulnerable code when handling a file with the .lzma filename suffix.
unlzma is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42375:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42375)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to ash that contains the special characters $, {, }, or # .
ash is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42376:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42376)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to hush that contains the special character \x03 (delimiter).
hush is built by the default BusyBox configuration, but not shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42377:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42377)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to hush that contains the special character &.

#### [CVE-2021-42378](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42378), [CVE-2021-42386:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42386)

Applies if the attacker can supply an arbitrary pattern to awk (the pattern is the first positional argument this applet takes).
awk is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

## Research Methodology

To research BusyBox, we used static and dynamic analysis approaches.

First, a manual review of the BusyBox source code was conducted in a top-down approach (following user input up to specific applet handling). We also looked for obvious logical/memory corruption vulnerabilities.

The next approach was fuzzing. We compiled BusyBox with [ASan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer) and implemented an [AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL) harness for each BusyBox applet. Each harness was subsequently optimized by removing unnecessary parts of the code, running multiple fuzzing cycles on the same process [(persistent mode)](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2015/06/new-in-afl-persistent-mode.html), and running multiple fuzzed instances in parallel.

We started from fuzzing all the daemon applets, including HTTP, Telnet, DNS, DHCP, NTP etc. Many code changes were required in order to effectively fuzz network-based input. For example, the main modification we performed was to replace all recv functions with input from STDIN in order to support fuzzed inputs. Similar changes were done when we fuzzed non-server applets as well.

We prepared a couple of examples for each applet and ran hundreds of fuzzed BusyBox instances for a few days. This gave us tens of thousands of crashes to evaluate. We had to create classes of crashes with the same root cause to help reduce the volume of crashes we had in our sample set. Later, we minimized each group representative in order to work with a small subset of unique crash inputs.

To fulfill these tasks, we developed automatic tooling that digested all crash data and classified it based on the crash analysis report which mainly includes the crash stack trace, registers, and assembly code of the relevant code area. For example, we merged cases with similar crash stack traces because they usually had the same problematic root cause.

Finally, we researched each unique crash and minimized its input vector in order to understand the root cause, which allowed us to create a proof-of-concept (PoC) that exploits the vulnerability responsible for the crash. In addition, we tested our PoCs against several BusyBox versions to understand when the bugs were introduced to the source code.

**To summarize, here are the steps we took in our research:**

1. Code Review
2. Fuzzing
3. Reduction and Minimization
4. Triage
5. Proof of Concept
6. Testing Multiple Versions
7. Disclosure

## Guide, Resources for BusyBox Fuzzing

As part of our commitment to the OSS and security communities, we created a simple on-boarding guide detailing how to fuzz BusyBox. The guide is published alongside all of the fuzzing harnesses we wrote as part of our fuzzing efforts. We hope these fuzzing harnesses can be further improved by the community, in order to find and fix even more bugs in BusyBox.

**All materials are available on [Claroty's GitHub page](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing).**

## Threat Analysis

To assess the threat level posed by these vulnerabilities, we inspected JFrog's database of more than 10,000 embedded firmware images (comprised of only publicly available firmware, and not images uploaded to JFrog's Artifactory). We found that 40% of them contained a BusyBox executable file that is linked with one of the affected applets, making these issues extremely widespread among Linux-based embedded firmware.

However, we believe these issues do not currently pose a critical security threat because:

1. While the DoS vulnerabilities are trivial to exploit, the impact is usually mitigated by the fact that applets almost always run as a separate forked process.
2. The information leak vulnerability is nontrivial to exploit (see, next section).
3. The use-after-free vulnerabilities may be exploitable for remote code execution, but currently we did not attempt to create a weaponized exploit for them. In addition, it is quite rare (and inherently unsafe) to process an awk pattern from external input.

## Deep Dive: [CVE-2021-42374](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42374): LZMA OOB Read

### Lempel-Ziv-Markov Chain Algorithm (LZMA) and Range Coding

[LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm) is a compression algorithm that uses dictionary compression, and encodes its output using a range encoder. The dictionary compressor finds matches using sophisticated dictionary data structures, and produces a stream of literal symbols and phrase references, which are encoded one bit at a time by the range encoder, using a complex model to make a probability prediction of each bit.

The compression algorithm encodes the compressed stream as a stream of bits using an adaptive binary range coder. Data is broken into packets, where each packet describes either a single byte, or an LZ77 sequence, with its length and distance implicitly or explicitly encoded.

The .lzma format, below, consists of a 13-byte header followed by the LZMA compressed data. Here is a small example of compressing the string "abc" using LZMA:

![LZMA file format](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9kMDNhZTNhMWFlN2Q1NmVjNDNhNzkwZjE1YmVmYTlkZC1MWk1BLnBuZw==/d03ae3a1ae7d56ec43a790f15befa9dd-LZMA.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ff0e1e34fcf6feed7aed6dcfdd08cfee)

In order to output the decompressed stream, LZMA implementations use a memory buffer that is initialized in the size of the user-provided dictionary size (part of the LZMA header). Once that buffer is filled, it automatically outputs the data thus far, flushes the buffer and starts filling it up again.

## The Vulnerability

The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient size check, below, in the function decompress\_unlzma.c (at line 295) when the state >= LZMA\_NUM\_LIT\_STATES:

![BusyBox Screen](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy83MmZiNWFlZDJjMTE3NjUyYjRjNzU0YmRiNzFlODUxZi1CdXN5Ym94U2NyZWVuLVNob3QxLnBuZw==/72fb5aed2c117652b4c754bdb71e851f-BusyboxScreen-Shot1.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=871614b4e1d8ca01181f87fd19d71b0b)

To trigger the vulnerability and to control the starting offset where we will leak data from, we need to make sure that the following conditions are satisfied:

buffer\_pos = 0
and
rep0 = offset + dict\_size

This way, pos will be equal to -(offset + dict\_size). After adding dict\_size, pos will be -offset and so we could leak memory from our desired offset through match\_byte. The leaked memory will most likely contain pointers which could further assist attackers in their exploitation campaign (ex. by facilitating ASLR bypass).

## Causing an Out-of-Bounds Access

The general idea to exploit this vulnerability is to prepare a specifically crafted LZMA encoded stream, so that when it is decoded, both conditions will be filled and pos will be equal to a negative number -offset. Eventually, the decompressed stream will contain the leaked memory, which will be written to the output steam.

To satisfy the first condition buffer\_pos = 0, we need to make sure our code flow (state >= LZMA\_NUM\_LIT\_STATES) is reached right after the current decompressed buffer stream is flushed and so the buffer pointer position will be 0. We can achieve this by reaching the last iteration, below, of a current match:

![BusyBox Buffer Screen](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy80NDRkMjA2YjNkYWYzYzY2MDgxMTU5OTZlODMwODk5MS1CdXN5Ym94LXNjcmVlbnNob3QyLnBuZw==/444d206b3daf3c6608115996e8308991-Busybox-screenshot2.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=6a65d75f65861c4938c240f7b32a72c4)

The second condition is more difficult to satisfy and requires intimate knowledge of how the LZMA algorithm works. The general idea is to encode a special length in the LZMA bit stream so that when decoded it will be used by the rep0 variable.

To conclude, in order to reach an OOB condition, we need to write some bytes, then use a match to fill the buffer to header.dict\_size and change rep0 to our desired value. Therefore, pos will be equal -offset and we could leak bytes from offset as a reference to the buffer pointer.

## Leaking Bits from Out-of-Bounds Memory

After reading the match\_byte, we will get to this flow, below:

![BusyBox Vulnerability](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9lMjVkYmMwMWRlMmQ0NWYzOWRmNzZmZDMzN2EyMGJjZi1CdXN5Ym94LXNjcmVlbnNob3QzLnBuZw==/e25dbc01de2d45f39df76fd337a20bcf-Busybox-screenshot3.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ee3df1ca72ffcf74de23e3bcdd84f164)

As long as the bits match our match\_byte (the leaked byte), it will be in the loop that reads the probability from prob + 0x100 + bit + mi, but once one bit is not matched, it reads it from prob + mi. We can detect what was the first unmatched bit, by checking if prob + mi was changed by writing more literal bytes, or if the probability was changed and we got a different output. Finally, the leaked bits will get flushed to the decompressed buffer.

## Weaponizing ZIP Files

Although the vulnerability was found in the LZMA decompression algorithm, we found that many applets support an LZMA compression and will try to decompress encoded LZMA streams by default (see section, "Fixes and Workarounds" for the configuration flags governing this behavior). For example, the ubiquitous ZIP format supports LZMA compression as a "type 14" compression.

From an attacker's perspective, ZIP is a much better attack vector because:

* unzip invocations are much more common than direct invocations of unlzma.
* With this attack vector, there are no constraints on the filename that's going to be unzipped (unlike in the tar attack vector, which requires a .lzma suffix).
* The leaked data can be extracted and saved into files that can be later read remotely. For example, this can happen in an embedded web service that permits uploading zip files with media resources, which will get extracted to an accessible location. From there, the attacker could read the leaked memory data.

To test this, we built a small PoC script that generates a weaponized ZIP where one of the files is compressed using LZMA, below:

![Segmentation Fault](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9kYmVlYWE5ZDg4MTc2NTA5YjgwZmZmZTA4MzVhOGM3Yi1MWk1BY29kZS0xMDI0eDUyMS5wbmc=/dbeeaa9d88176509b80fffe0835a8c7b-LZMAcode-1024x521.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ae2d5c26a57ff37701b0b4a42298b9fe)
## Fixes and Workarounds

All 14 vulnerabilities have been fixed in BusyBox 1.34.0 ([direct download link](https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.34.0.tar.bz2)) and users are urged to upgrade.

If upgrading BusyBox is not possible (due to specific version compatibility needs), BusyBox 1.33.1 and earlier versions can be compiled without the vulnerable functionality (applets) as a workaround.

After running make deconfig in BusyBox's source directory (or if reusing a previous configuration), edit the .config file such as:

* man - Comment out CONFIG\_MAN=y
* lzma - Comment out CONFIG\_UNLZMA=y , CONFIG\_FEATURE\_SEAMLESS\_LZMA=y and CONFIG\_FEATURE\_UNZIP\_LZMA=y
* ash - Comment out CONFIG\_ASH=y
* hush - Comment out CONFIG\_HUSH=y
* awk - Comment out CONFIG\_AWK=y
