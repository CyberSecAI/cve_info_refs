The provided content is related to CVE-2021-42195.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
A heap-buffer-overflow exists in the `handleEditText` function within `swfdump.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a heap-buffer-overflow, which occurs when writing data past the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**
The impact is a crash of the program due to the heap-buffer-overflow, as demonstrated by the AddressSanitizer output and aborting. It is likely that a malicious actor could leverage this type of vulnerability to execute arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is triggered when parsing a specially crafted SWF file, which contains data for the `handleEditText` function. This data causes the overflow when processed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to provide a malicious SWF file to the `swfdump` utility. The attacker does not need local access to the target system, however the SWF file must be processed by `swfdump`. The attacker would need the ability to provide the file to a vulnerable program.

**Additional details:**
The provided content includes AddressSanitizer output which indicates the exact location of the overflow within the `handleEditText` function at line 549 in `swfdump.c`. It also provides a sample command line to reproduce the issue. The content also includes a link to a POC file demonstrating the vulnerability, named `handleEditText_poc`.
