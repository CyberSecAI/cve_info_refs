Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

* **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the direct use of the `$_POST[r_name]` parameter in a system command without proper sanitization. Specifically, the value is passed into a `$mysqlstr` variable which is then executed by the `exec()` function.
* **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The primary weakness is the lack of input sanitization, allowing for command injection. Specifically, the application is vulnerable to Remote Code Execution (RCE)
* **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server where the vulnerable code is running. This could lead to a complete compromise of the server, data theft, or other malicious activities.
* **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is a crafted POST request to the vulnerable `datarec.php` endpoint, with the `r_name` parameter containing malicious shell commands.
* **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the server hosting the `datarec.php` file. No authentication requirements were mentioned, but it might be needed. The attacker needs to be aware of the vulnerable endpoint and parameter.

The provided content gives a very clear explanation of the vulnerability, including a proof-of-concept (PoC) with detailed steps to achieve remote command execution. The steps consist of: setting up a netcat listener, sending a post request with the crafted payload in `r_name` parameter to gain reverse shell.
