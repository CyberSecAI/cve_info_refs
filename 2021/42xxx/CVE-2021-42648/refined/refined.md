The provided content is related to CVE-2021-42648.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input in the `code-server` application. Specifically, the application does not properly handle special characters within the URL path, leading to an XSS vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application's context. This could lead to:

*   Stealing user cookies and session tokens.
*   Performing actions on behalf of the victim user.
*   Redirecting the user to malicious sites.
*   Defacing the application.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a crafted URL, specifically by injecting malicious code into the path of a static file request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted URL to a user of the `code-server` application, for example by sending a malicious link via email or chat. The user needs to visit the link for the attack to be successful. The attacker does not require any privileged access.

**Technical details**
The vulnerable code is within the `/static/` path where the application fails to sanitize the input allowing arbitrary html code to be interpreted by the user's browser.
The specific payload used to demonstrate the vulnerability in the steps to reproduce is:
`/static/test%3Cmy_tag_efb4535077ba29aaca28167c491b4249/%3E%3Cimg%20src=x%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(1)%3C/script%3E`
This injects an `<img>` tag with a non-existent source and a `<script>` tag that executes an alert.
