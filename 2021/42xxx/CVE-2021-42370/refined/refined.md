Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The UI of XoruX LPAR2RRD and STOR2RRD displayed the actual passwords used to connect to monitored systems within HTML "password" input fields.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Plaintext Password Exposure:** Passwords were not masked on the HTML interface, although they were in a "password" type input field, and could be easily revealed using browser's developer tools by changing the input type to "text".
- **Weak Password Handling:** The application design allowed for retrieval of the stored passwords.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Credential Theft:** Attackers could easily obtain the credentials used by XoruX to connect to monitored systems.
- **Lateral Movement:** With stolen credentials, attackers could compromise the monitored systems.
- **Full Infrastructure Compromise:** Attackers could potentially gain access to the entire monitored infrastructure.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network Access:**  Attackers required network access to the XoruX administration interface to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Web Browser:** Exploitation involves using a web browser to access the vulnerable UI.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** Attackers needed to have valid credentials to access the XoruX administration forms.
- **Browser Access:** An attacker needs a web browser to access the interface and utilize browser developer tools.
- **Basic Web Knowledge:** Basic understanding of HTML and browser developer tools is necessary to change the field type from "password" to "text".
