The provided content relates to CVE-2021-42536.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the exposure of sensitive information to unauthorized actors due to all users having read access to global variables containing peer username and password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Exposure of sensitive information to an unauthorized actor (CWE-200). Specifically, the vulnerability lies in the lack of access control for reading global variables that store sensitive data such as peer usernames and passwords.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can gain access to sensitive information, including peer usernames and passwords which could facilitate further attacks on the system and potentially compromise other devices on the network.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via network access.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user (low privileged) on the network. The attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable device, and then read the global variables where the sensitive information is exposed.
