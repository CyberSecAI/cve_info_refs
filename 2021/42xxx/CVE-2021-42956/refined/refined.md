Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The Remote Access Plus (RAP) agent application (ToolsIQ.exe) and the server application both launch automatically upon startup with the privileges of the logged-in user, even if it's a non-admin user.
*   The application does not clear sensitive information from memory.
*   Improper ACL and privilege management.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Information Leakage:** The application stores sensitive information, including passwords, secrets, database connection strings, user details, and tokens, in memory without proper cleanup.
*   **Memory Dump Vulnerability:**  The application's memory can be easily dumped by any logged-in user due to the lack of proper access controls.
*   **Lack of Memory Recycling:** The application doesn't automatically clear or recycle memory, leaving sensitive data exposed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality Loss:** An attacker can extract sensitive information from the memory dump, including credentials, API keys, and other sensitive data.
*   **Lateral Movement:**  Compromised credentials could allow attackers to move laterally within the network and gain access to other systems, especially in corporate environments where a single admin account is often used across multiple systems.
*   **Privilege Escalation (indirect):** The dumped credentials of a high-privileged user could be used to escalate privileges on the local machine or other systems.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker needs local access to the system where the vulnerable RAP agent or server application is running.
*   **Memory Dump:**  The attacker can use standard tools like Task Manager or Process Hacker 2 to create a memory dump of the application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a valid user account on the system where the vulnerable application is running. The account does not need to be an administrator.
*   The attacker must be able to execute commands or use tools for dumping process memory.

**Additional Information**
* The vulnerability is rated as high severity (CVSS 7.8).
* The vulnerability affects both the RAP server and agent applications.
* The fixed version is 10.1.2132.6
* The article provides steps to reproduce the vulnerability, supporting evidence screenshots, and remediation recommendations.

**CVE-2021-42956:** This information aligns with the CVE description, which is a placeholder.  The provided content details a sensitive info leakage vulnerability caused by a lack of memory protection and improper privilege management.
