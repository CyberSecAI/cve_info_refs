Based on the provided content, here's an analysis related to potential vulnerabilities:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Default Credentials:** The primary root cause was the use of default credentials on various systems, including:
    *   Exterity IPTV system devices (AvediaPlayers, AvediaStream encoders, AvediaServers)
    *   One of the Education Paging and Intercom Communications (EPIC) servers
    *   SMB file share used by EPIC servers for backups
*   **Vendor Privilege Escalation Vulnerabilities:** The author discovered three vulnerabilities in Exterity's IPTV products, allowing root access. One was a known GTFO-bin, and two others were novel vulnerabilities.
* **Insecure Configuration:** The web servers on AvediaPlayer devices were not bound to localhost. This allowed the attacker to send commands via the network.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsecured Network Devices:** Exposed network devices, including security cameras, without password authentication.
*   **Remote Command Execution:**  SSH access on AvediaPlayers allowed remote command execution.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The author was able to gain root access to all IPTV systems.
*   **Insecure File Shares:** SMB file share used for backups had default credentials and contained password hashes.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The ability to upload and execute a custom shell script to AvediaPlayers indicates a lack of proper input sanitization.
*   **Lack of Network Segmentation:** The student network had access to administrative interfaces of the IPTV and bell systems.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** The attacker gained unauthorized access to various systems, including IPTV displays, security cameras, and the bell system.
*   **System Takeover:**  The attacker gained root access to IPTV devices and admin access to bell systems.
*   **Service Disruption:**  The attacker was able to disrupt normal operations by:
    *   Displaying custom video content (rickroll) on all networked displays.
    *   Changing the bell schedule and playing custom audio.
* **Data Exposure:** Password hashes for the bell systems were exposed via the backup files.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Scanning:** Initial access was gained by scanning the internal network for exposed devices.
*   **Direct Access:** Using default credentials to login to web interfaces and SSH servers.
*   **Exploitation of Vendor Vulnerabilities:** Utilizing novel and known privilege escalation vulnerabilities.
*   **Abuse of Backup System:** Accessing the backup files to gain credentials for other systems.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needed access to the internal network, which was accessible from the student network.
*   **Technical Skills:**  The attacker required skills in network scanning, Linux administration, shell scripting, and reverse engineering/exploit development.
*   **Knowledge of Default Credentials:**  The attacker needed to have the knowledge of default credentials for devices.
*   **Persistence:** The attacker required time and persistence to research and prepare the attack.

**Additional Details**

*   The author developed a C2 shell script to control the AvediaPlayers, which enabled centralized control.
*   The author used `ffmpeg` to create and broadcast an RTP multicast stream for video playback.
*   The author performed a detailed penetration test and reported their findings to the school district.
