- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insecure deserialization of form data. The Zammad application has a feature to embed a form on a website, which allows website visitors to create tickets. The vulnerability lies in how the application deserializes this form data.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insecure deserialization.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Remote code execution on the application server. An attacker can inject malicious code through the form data, which when deserialized, will execute within the context of the application server.
- **Attack vectors**: By including malicious data in a form submitted through the embedded form functionality of Zammad, an attacker can trigger the insecure deserialization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to submit data to the form functionality, which would typically be a visitor of a website embedding the Zammad form.
