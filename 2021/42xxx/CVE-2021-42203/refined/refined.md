The provided content relates to CVE-2021-42203.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap-use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback` function within `swftext.c`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-use-after-free. Memory allocated is freed, but later accessed again in `swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback` at modules/swftext.c:508.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability leads to a crash due to the use-after-free. It is unclear if the vulnerability is exploitable for arbitrary code execution based on the provided information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by processing a crafted SWF file. The specific input causing the issue can be found in the provided POC `swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback_uaf_poc` (https://gitee.com/cxlzff/fuzz-poc/blob/master/swftools/swf_FontExtract_DefineTextCallback_uaf_poc)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted SWF file to be processed by `swfdump`.
