Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the identified vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input (specifically, the `title` and `message` parameters) when creating notifications within the `notimoo.js` library. The library directly uses the provided input within the HTML structure of the notification, leading to the potential execution of malicious code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The primary vulnerability is XSS. The application fails to sanitize or encode the `title` and `message` parameters, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the user's browser when the notification is displayed, which can have various impacts like:
   - Stealing user cookies or session tokens.
   - Performing actions on behalf of the user without their knowledge.
   - Redirecting the user to a malicious website.
   - Displaying misleading content or defacing the interface.
- This exploit can potentially lead to a complete compromise of the user's session and sensitive data if not mitigated.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted notification content: The attack vector is through a crafted notification where the attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code within the `title` and `message` parameters.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to trigger the notification: The attacker must be able to trigger the notification containing the malicious payload. This typically means the attacker can control or influence the content of the title or message.

**Additional Information:**
The provided content includes the following additional details:
- Affected lines: `https://github.com/PaquitoSoft/Notimoo/blob/master/Source/Notimoo.js#L224` and `https://github.com/PaquitoSoft/Notimoo/blob/master/Source/Notimoo.js#L225`. These lines of code are where the injected content is used without sanitization.
- Proof of concept (POC):
  ```javascript
  notimooManager.show({
    title: '<img src=x onerror=alert()>',
    message: 'This is a sample notitication showing how easy is to use Notimoo.'
  });
  ```
- A commit `b30d30c` has been created to address the issue by only accepting text and not html in title and message parameters.
