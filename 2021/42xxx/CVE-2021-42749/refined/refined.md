Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-42749:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from how Beaver Themer handles content when a layout is applied to a post archive or search result and the post excerpt is not explicitly set. The system uses the native WordPress `the_excerpt()` function, which retrieves data from the `post_content` field. Beaver Builder mirrors text-based module content into the `post_content`. The issue arises because the visibility and conditional logic rules, intended to hide content, were not being applied to the data stored in `post_content`. Consequently, when WordPress generated excerpts for post archives or search results, it included the hidden content if it appeared at the beginning of the post.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Sensitive Information Disclosure:** The primary weakness is that content intended to be hidden based on visibility or conditional logic settings is exposed to unauthorized users.
*   **Improper Access Control:** The visibility and conditional logic controls were not correctly applied when generating excerpts for archive layouts or search results.
*   **Reliance on `post_content`**: The vulnerability exists because the excerpt function was pulling from the `post_content` without applying the visibility rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Content Exposure:**  Sensitive or restricted content that was hidden using Beaver Builder's visibility settings or Beaver Themer's conditional logic becomes visible in post archives and search results. This exposure may lead to unauthorized disclosure of information intended for specific users.
*   **Search Engine Indexing:** Exposed content can be indexed by search engines like Google, making it publicly discoverable, including in search engine results pages (SERPs).
*   **Third-Party Modules:** 3rd party modules that use the native WordPress `the_excerpt()` function will also suffer from this vulnerability

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Post Archives:** Navigating to a post archive page (category, tag, date, etc.) will reveal the protected content in the excerpt area of the posts, if a themer layout is applied and an excerpt is not set.
*   **Search Results:** Performing a search on the website may return results that include the protected content if a themer layout is applied and an excerpt is not set.
*   **Google Search:** Search results from Google will display the protected content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Authentication Required**: The vulnerability can be exploited by any user, including unauthenticated, anonymous users.
*   **Basic Web Access:** The attacker only needs the ability to access the affected website through a web browser or search engine.
*   **No Direct Interaction**: Exploitation does not require any direct interaction with the vulnerable plugins; the content is exposed by the website's design.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is specific to Beaver Themer when used with post archives and search results.
*   The fix involves bypassing the native excerpt function and utilizing Beaver Builder's layout functions to generate excerpts.
*   A utility plugin is available to remove hidden content from the `post_content` field for existing affected pages.
*   The vulnerability was addressed in Beaver Builder version 2.5.1
