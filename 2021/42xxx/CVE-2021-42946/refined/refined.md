Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42946:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input in the "Copyright" field of the HTMLy configuration page. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. This means the malicious payload is stored in the application's database and executed when other users visit the page containing the vulnerable input.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser. This can be used to:
    - Steal cookies and session tokens.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the website.
    - Perform actions on behalf of the victim.
    - Other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through the admin configuration page (/admin/config), specifically the "Copyright" field. An attacker with admin access can inject the malicious payload through this field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker must have administrative access to the HTMLy application to access the config page and modify the "Copyright" field.
