Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-42562

**Description:** Improper Access Control in MITRE Caldera

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper segregation of user privileges within the MITRE Caldera application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Access Control:** Non-admin users can access and modify configurations and components that should be restricted to admin users.
- **API Access Bypass:** The UI restricts non-admin users from accessing the "Configuration" tab. However, by directly making API requests with a valid non-admin user session cookie, the access control is bypassed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Configuration Changes:** Non-admin users can modify critical configurations that can potentially disrupt the system.
- **Command Injection:** A non-admin user can leverage this vulnerability to achieve command injection by modifying the configuration parameters. This is due to the application failing to properly sanitize user input in configurations, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands (as noted in the reference to CVE-2021-42559).
- **Privilege Escalation**: Although not directly mentioned, modifying configurations might lead to further privilege escalation if a non-admin user can gain capabilities they are not supposed to have.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct API Requests:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending direct API requests (specifically POST requests to `/api/rest`) with a valid non-admin user's session cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Valid User Credentials:** The attacker must have valid credentials for a non-admin user account within the Caldera application.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the Caldera server.

**Technical Details:**

The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates how a non-admin user ("blue" in this case) can:
1. **Login:** Successfully authenticate with valid credentials.
2. **Obtain Session Cookie:** Receive a session cookie in the login response.
3. **Send Malicious API Request:** Send a `POST` request to the `/api/rest` endpoint, using the session cookie from step 2. This request includes a JSON payload to modify the system configuration. The example provided modifies the `requirements` section, injecting a malicious bash command.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in MITRE Caldera versions <= 2.8.1.
- This vulnerability is related to and can be leveraged to exploit CVE-2021-42559 (Command Injection Via Configurations).
