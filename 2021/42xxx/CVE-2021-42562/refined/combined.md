# CVE-2021-42562: Improper Access Control in MITRE Caldera

Caldera (versions <=2.8.1) does not properly segregate user privileges, resulting in non-admin users having access to read and modify configuration or other components which should only be accessible by admin users.

### Software:

The MITRE Caldera software can be found [here](https://github.com/mitre/caldera).

### Requirements:

This vulnerability requires:

* Valid user credentials

### Proof Of Concept:

For this scenario we will login as the non-admin user "blue". As can be seen in the image below, blue does not have access to the "Configuration" tab, but by using direct API requests, we are still able to read and modify the configurations.

[![](/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/raw/master/CVE-2021-42562-Improper%20Access%20Control-MITRE%20Caldera/Images/blue.png)](/DrunkenShells/Disclosures/blob/master/CVE-2021-42562-Improper%20Access%20Control-MITRE%20Caldera/Images/blue.png)

## What's Changed

### Backwards-Breaking Changes

* Completely refactored UI/UX VueJS front end. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* Installation/run commands changed! The first time you run Caldera, you must add the `--build` flag in order to build the VueJS UI. If you restart the server afterwards, the `--build` flag is not needed.
* Dropped support for Python 3.7. [#2795](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2795)

### UI

* Summary dashboard landing page with tiles for agents, operations, adversaries, abilities, and server address. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* New network and table Operation view. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* Agent hosts displayed on network view with OS platform icon. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* Agents are denoted by colored rings around hosts they are beaconing from, with multiple agents marked by multiple rings, and the colors denoting the status of agent. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* Agents with elevated user execution privileges on their host are denoted by red tinted host OS platform icon. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* Agent side panel (in network view) that shows key agent/host information. Activated when Agent/host node clicked. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* Agent actions shortcut on agent side panel. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* Operation action table. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* Ability commands now have code syntax highlighting. [#2776](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2776)
* Fact sources can now be downloaded from Fact Sources view. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* Added option to rename facts [#2811](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2811)

### Plugins

* (Bug Fix) **Manx Plugin**: Fixed JSON decoding error fixed with short sleep to avoid timing issues.
* (Bug Fix) **Debrief Plugin**: Fixed bugs generating empty PDFs. [mitre/debrief#67](https://github.com/mitre/debrief/pull/67)
* (New) **Emu Plugin**: New Turla adversary emulation plan (Caldera Adversary profile) from MITRE ATT&CK Evals. <https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library/tree/master/turla>
* (New) **Sandcat Plugin**: Allow architecture headers to be supplied to Sandcat agent. This allows Darwin ARM64 platforms to be compiled. [mitre/sandcat#435](https://github.com/mitre/sandcat/pull/435)
* **Builder Plugin**: Moved `docker-py` dependency from core to the Builder plugin as it is optional.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed encryption key mismatch for backups when booting Caldera locally and then with Docker. [#2780](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2780)
* Removed operation visibility slider as had no effect on underlying operation. [#2806](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2806)
* HMAC digest comparison in authorization service is now more resistant to timing attacks. [#2823](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2823)
* Added manually skipped Abilities to Operation report. [#2822](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2822)
* Fixed bug selecting the wrong executor for potential links. [#2843](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2843)
* Moved `donut-shellcode` python package dependency to Stockpile plugin. Dependency was moved as `donut-shellcode` package cannot (at this time) be installed on MacOS ARM chip architectures and caused install issues for Caldera core. [#2874](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2874)
* Fixed Ragdoll agent's timestamp format (thanks to [@LwsChlds](https://github.com/LwsChlds)). [mitre/stockpile#571](https://github.com/mitre/stockpile/pull/571)

### Other

* Improved checking of reasons why abilities are skipped in operations. [#2623](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2623)

[4.2.0](/mitre/caldera/releases/tag/4.2.0)

## What's Changed

### Backwards-Breaking Changes

* Moved Atomic planner into Caldera main repo from stockpile. [#2768](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2768)

### Plugins

* The [mock plugin](https://github.com/mitre/mock) will no longer be officially supported.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed bug with the /operations API endpoint. [#2691](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2691)
* Fixed bug where newline was missing at the end of operation logs. [#2693](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2693)
* Fixed bug causing LDAP integration to fail. [#2718](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2718)
* Fixed bug with fact sources not being removed correctly. [#2732](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2732)
* Fixed bug causing Metasploit integration to fail.

### UI

* Fixed bug where plaintext command was not displayed correctly in the UI. [#2668](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2668)
* Fixed bug freezing UI when deleting an operation. [#2671](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2671)
* Adversary profile page now displays the Adversary ID for the selected adversary. [#2672](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2672)
* Tabs are now pinned to the top of the page. [#2695](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2695)

* Updated moving abilities on adversary page to be more clear. [#2770](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2770)

### Planners

* (New!) Naive Bayes planner: selects next action based on highest probability of success, as determined from historical operation report data.
* (New!) Universal and Existential requirements: can check facts against the entire knowledge base instead of only using facts used by the command.

### Other

* Link commands are now unencoded by default, but are still sent encoded if any obfuscation is used for an operation. [#2698](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2698)
* Added several event types to the eventing system: agent/added, fact/added, fact/updated, system/ready. [#2692](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2692)
* Sandcat agents now include return the "exit\_code" field in results. [#2713](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2713)
* Sandcat agents now close out their sessions properly, preventing large sessions potentially showing up in logs.

## What's Changed

### Bug Patches

* Fixed "Save + Add" button on "Add Ability" modal in adversaries page so it doesn't result in an error. [#2637](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2637)
* Fixed a first-time startup error in the Atomic plugin resulting from a loop when parsing atomic abilities. [#2657](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2657)
* Fixed a bug in the Training plugin preventing the first manx flag from completing. [#2638](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2638)
* Fixed "(unexpected keyword argument 'loop')" error from the start\_server call. [#2625](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2625)

### Security Fixes

* Patched a XSS bug found in the Operations tab and Debrief plugin that took advantage of unsanitized input in an operation's name field. [#2644](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2644)
  + Disclosure reports coming soon, stay tuned
  + Credit to Jayson Grace from Meta's Purple Team for discovering this vulnerability

### Operations Page

* Added "Operations Detail" modal on operation page that shows how the operation was configured at its start. [#2558](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2558)
* Tidied up row of buttons so they align better. [#2615](https://github.com/mitre/caldera/pull/2615)

### Adversaries

(New!) "Everything Bagel" adversary: A collection of all CALDERA abilities ordered by ATT&CK tactic. Particularly useful when using the new advanced planners (see below) and want all abilities at the disposal of the planner.

(In progress) Added a missing ability to the "Worm" Adversary in the Stockpile plugin.

### Planners

(New!) Look-Ahead Planner: A CALDERA planner that decides which abilities to execute based on expected future reward.

(New!) Guided Planner: A CALDERA planner which makes use of "distance to goals" in a dependency graph to select the optimal next action.

# What's Changed

## All New User Interface

* Brand new look and feel across the entire platform.
* [AlpineJS](http://alpinejs.dev/) has replaced JQuery as our front-end framework.
* [Bulma](https://bulma.io/) is our CSS framework of choice, which makes styling our templates a breeze.
* Core pages like operations, adversaries, and agents have been completely revamped to make them more powerful, insightful, and robust.

## Operations Page

* Made more use of screen real estate.
* Adding a potential link now gives you the ability to edit the command before it's added.
* You can select fact values for all fact templates in a potential link, either ones from a fact source or ones collected from the operation.

## Training Plugin

* UI has been refreshed to match the new UI in core CALDERA.
* Gameboard badge has been removed.
* Solution guides have been updated to reflect the changes in the new interface.

## Sandcat

* Can update executors mid-operation
* New "proc" executor that directly spawns desired processes
* New "native" executor that performs various TTPs through pure Golang.
* Now provides command output for timed-out links
* New C2 channels and capabilities: SSH tunneling, FTP, Slack

## Other

* REST API v2 with associated API Swagger Docs
* New open-source abilities and adversary profiles, including new collection and exfiltration capabilities.
* Timestamps in sandcat are now UTC instead of local time
* Automatic deletion of payloads is now optional
* Better storage of exfiltrated files to prevent overwriting
* More back end tests have been added
* General bug squashing and improvements

## v5.0

We've begun working on v5 and are excited to bring capabilities not currently seen by automated cyber operation platforms

[4.0.0 Alpha](/mitre/caldera/releases/tag/4.0.0-alpha)
Pre-release

Pre-release

\*\* Plugin UIs are still being updated so this will remain a pre-release until then

# New UI

We are re-imagining the way end users interact with CALDERA. This includes large updates to the UI.

Included is a new abilities screen to easily manage your extensive library.

# API v2

Calling all builders! For all those who build on the CALDERA platform we have a whole new API with full documentation. Currently docs are available once you start up the server. Look for a link at the bottom of the navigation menu "api docs"

# C2 Channels

We've introduced some new C2 channels, including:

* Slack
* SSH tunneling
* FTP

# Agent Updates

* Sandcat agent support for new C2 channels (Slack, FTP, SSH tunneling)
* New “proc” executor for Sandcat that will directly spawn processes using a provided executable path and arguments, rather than calling via PowerShell, sh, or cmd.
* Sandcat agents can remove executors or update executor binary paths
* Manx agents can properly run commands of longer durations.

# Knowledge Service

New service created to better manage facts and information during an operation or when performing analysis

# File upload/download encoding

Supports basic file encoding (plaintext and base64) for payload downloads and file uploads. To encode a downloaded payload or uploaded file, set the “x-file-encoding" HTTP header accordingly when making the download/upload request. Available data encoders are defined as Python modules in app/data\_encoders. Currently supported encoders are “plain-text” and “base64”

# Auth service

Add support for custom login handlers, as well as a new SAML authentication plugin.

# Other Changes

* Dropped python 3.6 support and now testing for 3.7, 3.8, and 3.9
* We now support all browsers, Google Chrome is no longer the only supported browser

[3.0.0](/mitre/caldera/releases/tag/3.0.0)

# Overview

Big improvements to usability, a new plugin called Emu that imports adversary emulation plans from CTID, P2P agent

communication, lateral movement tracking, and more!

# Plugin Updates

## NEW PLUGIN: Emu

This plugin imports adversary emulation plans from the Center for Threat Informed Defense

Learn more about the support emulation plans here:

<https://github.com/center-for-threat-informed-defense/adversary_emulation_library>

## Debrief

Debrief is now tracking lateral movement through the new attack path graph in addition to some changes made to sandcat and core!

Learn more about the feature here:

<https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Lateral-Movement-Guide.html#displaying-lateral-movement-in-debrief>

## Builder

Allow for dynamic compilation of C#, C, C++, and Go binaries. Code will be built in Docker containers, requiring additional setup when CALDERA starts, but reducing dependencies on the server. Both C# and Go binaries can be built with libraries/modules.

# New Features

## Peer-to-Peer Communication

Peer to Peer functionality allows agents within internal networks to chain together to enable beaconing and communications where a direct connection is not possible. The implementation in sandcat allows for varied channels of communication as well, so that an agent can be configured for the environment is is being deployed in. Also present in caldera is functionality for discovery of peers, so that an agent can be deployed from a generic binary and discover if there are any available peers to connect out through if direct connection to the C2 server is not possible. The CALDERA server will display the proxy chain and protocols used to facilitate the communications in the agents page.

## Lateral Movement Tracking

adds in the capability for caldera to track lateral movement via the originLinkID. This is passed in as an optional command line argument when executing an agent.

Learn more about the feature here:

<https://caldera.readthedocs.io/en/latest/Lateral-Movement-Guide.html#displaying-lateral-movement-in-debrief>

## Manual Links

Allow users to run arbitrary commands on agents. Previously, only commands in abilities could be run. Add manual links from the operation screen.

## Uploads

Similar to payload downloads in abilities, you can now specify file uploads in an ability YAML file. Supporting agents will upload the specified file(s) after completing an ability. File paths can be local or absolute.

Before, file uploads and exfiltration were performed using hardcoded commands (curl, powershell webclient, etc) that required HTTP(s) connection to the C2. In cases where the agent is using peer-to-peer and cannot directly access the server, old file upload commands wouldn’t work as intended. By adding in the upload capability as a separate ability and instruction component, supporting agents will use their contact method’s built-in upload functionality to send file bytes upstream, whether it is directly to the C2 server or to another agent proxy peer who will forward the bytes on their behalf.

## Deadman Abilities

Users can now specify deadman abilities in the agents.yml config or via the agent GUI modal to have supporting agents run them prior to termination. Whereas all agents will receive bootstrap abilities for immediate execution upon their first successful beacon, the CALDERA server will only send deadman abilities to agents who have indicated through their beacons that they support deadman abilities. An example use case for this functionality is to specify an ability that will remove the agent executable once the agent terminates, or other defense evasion abilities like clearing logs.
