This document provides details of multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-42726, which is not listed.

However, it does list several CVEs which are closely related to the missing one including:
- CVE-2021-42719
- CVE-2021-42720
- CVE-2021-42722
- CVE-2021-42724
- CVE-2021-42728
- CVE-2021-42729
- CVE-2021-42730
All of which relate to Adobe Bridge

Based on the information provided for the other CVEs:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125):** Reading memory outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer (CWE-788):** Accessing a memory location beyond the end of a buffer.
*   **Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787):** Writing to memory outside the allocated buffer.
*   **Use After Free (CWE-416):** Accessing memory that has already been freed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds read/write.
*   Use-after-free conditions leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the victim's machine, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Memory Leak**: May leak sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access (AV:L):** The vulnerabilities are exploited locally, meaning the attacker needs some form of access to the victim's machine.
*   **User Interaction (UI:R):** Exploitation requires user interaction, such as opening a malicious file with Adobe Bridge.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs local access to the system.
*   The attacker needs to entice a user to open a specially crafted file using Adobe Bridge.

**Summary of CVEs:**

*   **CVE-2021-40750:** NULL Pointer Dereference leading to memory leak
*  **CVE-2021-42533:** Double Free leading to arbitrary code execution
*  **CVE-2021-42719, CVE-2021-42720, CVE-2021-42722:** Out-of-bounds read leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **CVE-2021-42724, CVE-2021-42729, CVE-2021-42730:** Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **CVE-2021-42728:** Out-of-bounds write leading to arbitrary code execution.
*   **CVE-2021-42721:** Use After Free leading to arbitrary code execution.

The document does not include specific details for CVE-2021-42726, but the information provided about related CVEs gives insight into the type of vulnerabilities that were present in Adobe Bridge.
