Package        : mailman
CVE ID         : CVE-2020-12108 CVE-2020-15011 CVE-2021-42096 CVE-2021-42097

Several vulnerabilities were discovered in mailman, a web-based mailing
list manager, which could result in arbitrary content injection via the
options and private archive login pages, and CSRF attacks or privilege
escalation via the user options page.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 1:2.1.29-1+deb10u2.

We recommend that you upgrade your mailman packages.

For the detailed security status of mailman please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/mailman>

10:32 p.m.

A couple of vulnerabilities have recently been reported. Thanks to Andre
Protas, Richard Cloke and Andy Nuttall of Apple for reporting these and
helping with the development of a fix.

CVE-2021-42096 could allow a list member to discover the list admin
password.

CVE-2021-42097 could allow a list member to create a successful CSRF
attack against another list member enabling takeover of the members account.

These attacks can't be carried out by non-members so may not be of
concern for sites with only trusted list members.

In any case, I am planning to make a 2.1.35 release and to post a patch
for those who don't want to upgrade to address these issues. This is
scheduled for Tuesday, October 19.

# Potential Privilege escalation via the user options page.

Bug #1947639 reported by
[Mark Sapiro](https://launchpad.net/~msapiro)
on 2021-10-18

[256](/%2Bhelp-bugs/bug-heat.html)

This bug affects 1 person

| Affects | | Status | Importance | Assigned to | Milestone |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
|  | [GNU Mailman](https://bugs.launchpad.net/mailman) | Fix Released | Medium | [Mark Sapiro](https://launchpad.net/~msapiro) | [GNU Mailman 2.1.35](https://launchpad.net/mailman/%2Bmilestone/2.1.35) |

### Bug Description

The `csrf\_token` generated for the `options` page is always an `admin` token rather than specific to the authenticated user for that session. This admin token contains information that is derived from the hashed list admin password, which could theoretically allow a brute-force attack to obtain the list admin password.

Thanks to Andre Protas, Richard Cloke and Andy Nuttall of Apple for reporting these and helping with the development of a fix.
