Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42923:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue. The ShowMyPC application loads the `wodVPN.dll` from the user's `%temp%` directory, specifically from `%temp%\ShowMyPC\-ShowMyPC3606\`.  This location is writable by the user, which allows an attacker to place a malicious DLL in that directory, thus hijacking the DLL loading process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **DLL Hijacking:** The application loads a DLL from a user-writable directory (`%temp%`), which allows an attacker to replace the legitimate DLL with a malicious one.
*   **Lack of proper DLL loading validation:** The application doesn't verify the integrity or authenticity of the DLL before loading it.
*   **Insecure default file path:** The use of the temp directory for dll loading is not secure.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** By placing a malicious DLL named `wodVPN.dll` in the specified directory, an attacker can execute arbitrary code when the ShowMyPC application loads the DLL.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** The malicious code executes with the privileges of the logged-on user, potentially allowing for further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **File System Manipulation:** An attacker needs to overwrite the legitimate `wodVPN.dll` file in the `%temp%\ShowMyPC\-ShowMyPC3606\` directory with their own malicious DLL.
*   **User interaction:** The vulnerability occurs when the vulnerable application starts. The victim user needs to run the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local access:** The attacker must have the ability to write files to the victim's `%temp%` directory.
*   **User privileges:** The attacker does not need administrative rights; they can exploit this vulnerability with the same privileges as the user running the ShowMyPC application.

**Additional Information:**

The content specifies that the vulnerable version of ShowMyPC is 3606. The malicious code contained in the attacker's dll will be executed with the logged in user privileges.
