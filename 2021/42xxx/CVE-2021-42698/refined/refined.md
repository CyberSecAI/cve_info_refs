Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-42698:

**Vulnerability:** Deserialization of Untrusted Data (CWE-502)

**Root Cause:** The application stores memory objects in project files as binary serialized data. This data is later deserialized to reinstate the original objects in memory. The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation or sanitization during the deserialization process.

**Weaknesses:**
*   The application deserializes untrusted data from project files.
*   Maliciously crafted project files can be used to manipulate the serialized data.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to memory corruption.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   An attacker needs to create a malicious project file.
*   The user must open the malicious project file using the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious project file.
*   The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious project file on a system running the vulnerable software.
*   The attacker requires local access or the ability to deliver the malicious project file.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely.
*   The CVSS v3 base score for this vulnerability is 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).
*   This vulnerability affects all versions of DAQFactory 18.1 Build 2347 and prior.
*  The report also suggests mitigations such as avoiding opening files from untrusted sources and using safe mode.
