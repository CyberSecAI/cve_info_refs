- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787) in Adobe Animate.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required. User interaction is also required as the user needs to open a crafted file to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have a crafted file that, when opened by a user, will trigger the out-of-bounds write, leading to arbitrary code execution.
