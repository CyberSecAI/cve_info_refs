### Eliminate Joins, Simplify Querying

Neo4j makes querying simple by eliminating tables
and joins. Experience Cypher, our powerful query
language that simplifies data analysis with 10x less
code than SQL.

[Explore Cypher](/docs/getting-started/cypher-intro/)

```

Cypher
MATCH (p:Product)-[:CATEGORY]->(l:ProductCategory)-[:PARENT*0..]
->(:ProductCategory {name:"Dairy Products"})
RETURN p.name

SQL
SELECT p.ProductName
FROM Product AS p
JOIN ProductCategory pc ON (p.CategoryID = pc.CategoryID
AND pc.CategoryName = "Dairy Products")

JOIN ProductCategory pc1 ON (p.CategoryID = pc1.CategoryID)
JOIN ProductCategory pc2 ON (pc1.ParentID = pc2.CategoryID
AND pc2.CategoryName = "Dairy Products")

JOIN ProductCategory pc3 ON (p.CategoryID = pc3.CategoryID)
JOIN ProductCategory pc4 ON (pc3.ParentID = pc4.CategoryID)
JOIN ProductCategory pc5 ON (pc4.ParentID = pc5.CategoryID
AND pc5.CategoryName = "Dairy Products");

# Path traversal in several apoc.\* functions

Moderate

[jexp](/jexp)
published
GHSA-4mpj-488r-vh6m
Feb 1, 2022

## Package

maven

org.neo4j.procedure:apoc
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

<3.5.0.17, <4.2.0.10, <4.3.0.4, <4.4.0.1

## Patched versions

3.5.0.17, 4.2.0.10, 4.3.0.4, 4.4.0.1

## Description

### Impact

Directory Traversal Vulnerabilities found in several functions of apoc plugins in Neo4j Graph database. The attacker can retrieve and download files from outside the configured directory on the affected server. Under some circumstances, the attacker can also create files.

### Patches

The users should aim to use the latest released version compatible with their Neo4j version. The minimum versions containing patch for this vulnerability (for Neo4j 4.2, 4.3, and 4.4 bundled with APOC, upgrade to the appropriate patched version):

3.5 - bundle n/a, standalone 3.5.0.17

4.2 - bundle 4.2.13, standalone 4.2.0.10

4.3 - bundle 4.3.9, standalone 4.3.0.4

4.4 - bundle 4.4.2, standalone 4.4.0.1

### Workarounds

If you cannot upgrade the library, you can control the [allowlist of the functions](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/reference/configuration-settings/#config_dbms.security.procedures.allowlist) that can be used in your system:

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
