The provided content contains information about a SQL injection vulnerability in the SiteServer CMS.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from unsanitized user input in the `keyword` parameter of the `/api/pages/cms/libraryText/list` API endpoint.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input before using it in an SQL query.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database, which can lead to:
  - Data exfiltration
  - Data modification
  - Denial of service

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST request to the `/api/pages/cms/libraryText/list` endpoint.
- Malicious SQL code is injected through the "keyword" parameter in the JSON body of the POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the vulnerable endpoint.
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax is required to construct a malicious payload.
- Network access to the SiteServer CMS instance is required.
