utilities to access smart cards, which could lead to application crash
or information leak.

    utility on an error-case.

    A heap use after free vulnerability was discovered in
    sc_file_valid().

CVE-2021-42780

    An use after return vulnerability was discovered in insert_pin(),
    which could potentially crash programs using the library.

CVE-2021-42781

    Multiple heap buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in
    pkcs15-oberthur.c, which could potentially crash programs using the
    library.

CVE-2021-42782

    Multiple stack buffer overflow vulnerabilities were discovered in
    various places, which could potentially crash programs using the
    library.

CVE-2023-2977

    A buffer overrun vulnerability was discovered in pkcs15
    cardos_have_verifyrc_package(), which could lead to crash or
    information leak via smart card package with a malicious ASN1
