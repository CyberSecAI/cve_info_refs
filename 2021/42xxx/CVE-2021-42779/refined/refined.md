Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-42779:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A heap use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `sc_file_valid` function within the OpenSC library.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free: The code frees memory and then attempts to access it later. This can lead to unpredictable behavior and security issues.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The provided content indicates that exploitation could lead to a crash of applications using the library, potentially also leading to arbitrary code execution if the freed memory is reused for other purposes.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered when a smart card with a specific structure is used, which interacts with the vulnerable code path in `sc_file_valid`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be able to provide input that triggers the vulnerable code path, which involves interacting with a smart card. This means they need to have access to a vulnerable system and the ability to present a specially crafted smart card to it.

**Additional details:**

- The fix for this vulnerability is included in OpenSC version 0.22.0 and later.
- The specific code change that fixed this issue is available in the upstream commit: <https://github.com/OpenSC/OpenSC/commit/1db88374>.
- The vulnerability was initially discovered by oss-fuzz.
- The issue was also tracked in the Red Hat bug tracker as Bug 2016086.

In summary, this CVE describes a heap use-after-free vulnerability in OpenSC's `sc_file_valid` function. An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by using a specially crafted smart card, which can lead to application crashes and potentially arbitrary code execution.
