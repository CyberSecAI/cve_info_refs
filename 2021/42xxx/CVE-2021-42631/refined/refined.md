    "description": "PrinterLogic has released security updates to address nine vulnerabilities in Web Stack and Virtual Appliance, the most severe ones, tracked as CVE-2021-42631, CVE-2021-42635, and CVE-2021-42638, are rated as high severity flaws (CVSS base score of 8.1). An attacker can trigger these three vulnerabilities to remotely execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems. CVE-2021-42631 is an object injection flaw, CVE-2021-42635 is a hardcoded APP_KEY issue, while CVE-2021-42638 is miscellaneous command injections.  To exploit the PrinterLogic Web Stack server, attackers would need a privileged network position, such as access through a VPN or another vulnerability in an appliance on the edge.",
