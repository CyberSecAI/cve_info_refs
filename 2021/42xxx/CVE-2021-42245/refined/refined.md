Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when creating new pages, specifically within the meta tags and content sections. The application does not filter or escape XSS payloads within user-provided input.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript code through the meta tags or content of a page.
*   This can lead to:
    *   **Session Hijacking:** Stealing user session cookies.
    *   **Phishing:** Redirecting users to malicious websites or displaying fake login forms.
    *   **Defacement:** Changing the appearance or functionality of the website.
    *   **Malware Distribution:** Redirecting users to websites that download malware.
    *   **Unauthorized Actions:** Performing actions on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User Input:**  An attacker can craft malicious scripts within the meta tags and content fields when creating a new page through the admin panel.
*  **Stored XSS:** The injected script is stored in the database and will be executed every time the page is rendered for another user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with the ability to create new pages within the CMS.
*   **Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs to have the technical ability to craft malicious JavaScript payloads.
* **Access to Admin Panel:** The attacker will need to be able to access the administrative portion of the flatCore CMS application.

**Additional Details from Content:**
*   The issue was reported on October 10, 2021, and a fix was committed on October 11, 2021, which focused on sanitizing meta tags. However, the page content is mentioned as being more difficult to sanitize and may still be vulnerable in the discussion.
*  A YouTube video demonstrating the PoC is linked, though not available directly in this context.
*  The issue was closed as complete on October 27, 2021.
