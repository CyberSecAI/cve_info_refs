    "related_to_description": true,
    "root_cause": "An SMM callout vulnerability in certain InsydeH20 versions, specifically within the Int15ServiceSmm driver.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper validation of parameters passed to SMM callouts.",
      "Dereferencing of a pointer to call a GetVariable service located outside of SMRAM."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could lead to hijacking the execution flow of code running in System Management Mode (SMM) and escalating privileges to SMM, potentially resulting in disclosure of sensitive information, data modification, or denial of service.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Local access to the system is required to trigger the vulnerable SMM callout."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs high privileges on the local system to trigger this vulnerability. This usually implies control over the operating system or lower layers, such as a hypervisor.",
        "additional_details": "The vulnerability affects the Int15ServiceSmm driver and was reported by the Binarly efiXplorer team. Fixed versions are noted for InsydeH2O kernels 5.0, 5.1, 5.2, and 5.3. NetApp products using affected InsydeH20 versions in their BIOS are vulnerable."
