net: 6pack: fix slab-out-of-bounds in decode\_dataSyzbot reported slab-out-of bounds write in decode\_data().
The problem was in missing validation checks.
Syzbot's reproducer generated malicious input, which caused
decode\_data() to be called a lot in sixpack\_decode(). Since
rx\_count\_cooked is only 400 bytes and noone reported before,
that 400 bytes is not enough, let's just check if input is malicious
and complain about buffer overrun.

                 CVE-2021-43389

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-3702

    A flaw was found in the driver for Atheros IEEE 802.11n family of
    chipsets (ath9k) allowing information disclosure.

CVE-2020-16119

    Hadar Manor reported a use-after-free in the DCCP protocol
    implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially
    to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-0920

    A race condition was discovered in the local sockets (AF_UNIX)
    subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3612

    Murray McAllister reported a flaw in the joystick input subsystem.
    A local user permitted to access a joystick device could exploit
    this to read and write out-of-bounds in the kernel, which could
    be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3653

   Maxim Levitsky discovered a vulnerability in the KVM hypervisor
   implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel: Missing
   validation of the `int_ctl` VMCB field could allow a malicious L1
   guest to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt
   Controller) for the L2 guest. The L2 guest can take advantage of
   this flaw to write to a limited but still relatively large subset
   of the host physical memory.

CVE-2021-3655

    Ilja Van Sprundel and Marcelo Ricardo Leitner found multiple flaws
    in the SCTP implementation, where missing validation could lead to
    an out-of-bounds read.  On a system using SCTP, a networked
    attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3679

    A flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could
    allow a privileged local user (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) to
    cause a denial of service (resource starvation).

CVE-2021-3732

    Alois Wohlschlager reported a flaw in the implementation of the
    overlayfs subsystem, allowing a local attacker with privileges to
    mount a filesystem to reveal files hidden in the original mount.

CVE-2021-3753

    Minh Yuan reported a race condition in the vt_k_ioctl in
    drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c, which may cause an out of bounds read
    in vt.

CVE-2021-3760

    Lin Horse reported a flaw in the NCI (NFC Controller Interface)
    driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.

    However, this driver is not included in the binary packages
    provided by Debian.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
    driver.  A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
    underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20322

    An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation.  A
    remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
    ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
    DNS poisoning attack against that system.

CVE-2021-22543

    David Stevens discovered a flaw in how the KVM hypervisor maps
    host memory into a guest.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/kvm could use this to cause certain pages to be freed when
    they should not, leading to a use-after-free.  This could be used
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-37159

    A flaw was discovered in the hso driver for Option mobile
    broadband modems.  An error during initialisation could lead to a
    double-free or use-after-free.  An attacker able to plug in USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-38160

    A flaw in the virtio_console was discovered allowing data
    corruption or data loss by an untrusted device.

CVE-2021-38198

    A flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors, that could result in virtual memory protection within
    a guest not being applied correctly.  When shadow page tables are
    used - i.e. for nested virtualisation, or on CPUs lacking the EPT
    or NPT feature - a user of the guest OS might be able to exploit
    this for denial of service or privilege escalation within the
    guest.

CVE-2021-38199

    Michael Wakabayashi reported a flaw in the NFSv4 client
    implementation, where incorrect connection setup ordering allows
    operations of a remote NFSv4 server to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-38204

    A flaw was discovered in the max4321-hcd USB host controller
    driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.

    However, this driver is not included in the binary packages
    provided by Debian.

CVE-2021-38205

    An information leak was discovered in the xilinx_emaclite network
    driver.  On a custom kernel where this driver is enabled and used,
    this might make it easier to exploit other kernel bugs.

CVE-2021-40490

    A race condition was discovered in the ext4 subsystem when writing
    to an inline_data file while its xattrs are changing. This could
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2021-41864

    An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-42008

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the 6pack serial port
    network driver.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-42739

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
    FireWire-connected DVB receivers.  A local user with access to a
    firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43389

    The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
    subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read and object type confusion.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.290-1.

hugetlb: don't pass page cache pages to restore\_reserve\_on\_error
[ Upstream commit c7b1850dfb41d0b4154aca8dbc04777fbd75616f ]
syzbot hit kernel BUG at fs/hugetlbfs/inode.c:532 as described in [1].
This BUG triggers if the HPageRestoreReserve flag is set on a page in
the page cache. It should never be set, as the routine
huge\_add\_to\_page\_cache explicitly clears the flag after adding a page to
the cache.
The only code other than huge page allocation which sets the flag is
restore\_reserve\_on\_error. It will potentially set the flag in rare out
of memory conditions. syzbot was injecting errors to cause memory
allocation errors which exercised this specific path.
The code in restore\_reserve\_on\_error is doing the right thing. However,
there are instances where pages in the page cache were being passed to
restore\_reserve\_on\_error. This is incorrect, as once a page goes into
the cache reservation information will not be modified for the page
until it is removed from the cache. Error paths do not remove pages
from the cache, so even in the case of error, the page will remain in
the cache and no reservation adjustment is needed.
Modify routines that potentially call restore\_reserve\_on\_error with a
page cache page to no longer do so.
Note on fixes tag: Prior to commit 846be08578ed ("mm/hugetlb: expand
restore\_reserve\_on\_error functionality") the routine would not process
page cache pages because the HPageRestoreReserve flag is not set on such
pages. Therefore, this issue could not be trigggered. The code added
by commit 846be08578ed ("mm/hugetlb: expand restore\_reserve\_on\_error
functionality") is needed and correct. It exposed incorrect calls to
restore\_reserve\_on\_error which is the root cause addressed by this
commit.

kfence: fix is\_kfence\_address() for addresses below KFENCE\_POOL\_SIZE
[ Upstream commit a7cb5d23eaea148f8582229846f8dfff192f05c3 ]
Originally the addr != NULL check was meant to take care of the case
where \_\_kfence\_pool == NULL (KFENCE is disabled). However, this does
not work for addresses where addr > 0 && addr < KFENCE\_POOL\_SIZE.
This can be the case on NULL-deref where addr > 0 && addr < PAGE\_SIZE or
any other faulting access with addr < KFENCE\_POOL\_SIZE. While the
kernel would likely crash, the stack traces and report might be
confusing due to double faults upon KFENCE's attempt to unprotect such
an address.
Fix it by just checking that \_\_kfence\_pool != NULL instead.

mm/hwpoison: retry with shake\_page() for unhandlable pages
[ Upstream commit fcc00621d88b274b5dffd8daeea71d0e4c28b84e ]
HWPoisonHandlable() sometimes returns false for typical user pages due
to races with average memory events like transfers over LRU lists. This
causes failures in hwpoison handling.
There's retry code for such a case but does not work because the retry
loop reaches the retry limit too quickly before the page settles down to
handlable state. Let get\_any\_page() call shake\_page() to fix it.

mm,hwpoison: make get\_hwpoison\_page() call get\_any\_page()
[ Upstream commit 0ed950d1f28142ccd9a9453c60df87853530d778 ]
\_\_get\_hwpoison\_page() could fail to grab refcount by some race condition,
so it's helpful if we can handle it by retrying. We already have retry
logic, so make get\_hwpoison\_page() call get\_any\_page() when called from
memory\_failure().
As a result, get\_hwpoison\_page() can return negative values (i.e. error
code), so some callers are also changed to handle error cases.
soft\_offline\_page() does nothing for -EBUSY because that's enough and
users in userspace can easily handle it. unpoison\_memory() is also
unchanged because it's broken and need thorough fixes (will be done
later).

mm: memcontrol: fix occasional OOMs due to proportional memory.low reclaim
[ Upstream commit f56ce412a59d7d938b81de8878faef128812482c ]
We've noticed occasional OOM killing when memory.low settings are in
effect for cgroups. This is unexpected and undesirable as memory.low is
supposed to express non-OOMing memory priorities between cgroups.
The reason for this is proportional memory.low reclaim. When cgroups
are below their memory.low threshold, reclaim passes them over in the
first round, and then retries if it couldn't find pages anywhere else.
But when cgroups are slightly above their memory.low setting, page scan
force is scaled down and diminished in proportion to the overage, to the
point where it can cause reclaim to fail as well - only in that case we
currently don't retry, and instead trigger OOM.
To fix this, hook proportional reclaim into the same retry logic we have
in place for when cgroups are skipped entirely. This way if reclaim
fails and some cgroups were scanned with diminished pressure, we'll try
another full-force cycle before giving up and OOMing.

riscv: Fix a number of free'd resources in init\_resources()
[ Upstream commit aa3e1ba32e553e611a58145c2eb349802feaa6eb ]
Function init\_resources() allocates a boot memory block to hold an array of
resources which it adds to iomem\_resource. The array is filled in from its
end and the function then attempts to free any unused memory at the
beginning. The problem is that size of the unused memory is incorrectly
calculated and this can result in releasing memory which is in use by
active resources. Their data then gets corrupted later when the memory is
reused by a different part of the system.
Fix the size of the released memory to correctly match the number of unused
resource entries.

ASoC: intel: atom: Fix breakage for PCM buffer address setup

The commit 2e6b836312a4 ("ASoC: intel: atom: Fix reference to PCM
buffer address") changed the reference of PCM buffer address to
substream->runtime->dma\_addr as the buffer address may change
dynamically. However, I forgot that the dma\_addr field is still not
set up for the CONTINUOUS buffer type (that this driver uses) yet in
5.14 and earlier kernels, and it resulted in garbage I/O. The problem
will be fixed in 5.15, but we need to address it quickly for now.
The fix is to deduce the address again from the DMA pointer with
virt\_to\_phys(), but from the right one, substream->runtime->dma\_area.

powerpc/32s: Fix random crashes by adding isync() after locking/unlocking KUEP
[ Upstream commit ef486bf448a057a6e2d50e40ae879f7add6585da ]
Commit b5efec00b671 ("powerpc/32s: Move KUEP locking/unlocking in C")
removed the 'isync' instruction after adding/removing NX bit in user
segments. The reasoning behind this change was that when setting the
NX bit we don't mind it taking effect with delay as the kernel never
executes text from userspace, and when clearing the NX bit this is
to return to userspace and then the 'rfi' should synchronise the
context.
However, it looks like on book3s/32 having a hash page table, at least
on the G3 processor, we get an unexpected fault from userspace, then
this is followed by something wrong in the verification of MSR\_PR
at end of another interrupt.
This is fixed by adding back the removed isync() following update
of NX bit in user segment registers. Only do it for cores with an
hash table, as 603 cores don't exhibit that problem and the two isync
increase ./null\_syscall selftest by 6 cycles on an MPC 832x.

powerpc/32s: Refactor update of user segment registers
[ Upstream commit 91bb30822a2e1d7900f9f42e9e92647a9015f979 ]
KUEP implements the update of user segment registers.
Move it into mmu-hash.h in order to use it from other places.
And inline kuep\_lock() and kuep\_unlock(). Inlining kuep\_lock() is
important for system\_call\_exception(), otherwise system\_call\_exception()
has to save into stack the system call parameters that are used just
after, and doing that takes more instructions than kuep\_lock() itself.

usb: typec: tcpm: Fix VDMs sometimes not being forwarded to alt-mode drivers
[ Upstream commit 5571ea3117ca22849072adb58074fb5a2fd12c00 ]
Commit a20dcf53ea98 ("usb: typec: tcpm: Respond Not\_Supported if no
snk\_vdo"), stops tcpm\_pd\_data\_request() calling tcpm\_handle\_vdm\_request()
when port->nr\_snk\_vdo is not set. But the VDM might be intended for an
altmode-driver, in which case nr\_snk\_vdo does not matter.
This change breaks the forwarding of connector hotplug (HPD) events
for displayport altmode on devices which don't set nr\_snk\_vdo.
tcpm\_pd\_data\_request() is the only caller of tcpm\_handle\_vdm\_request(),
so we can move the nr\_snk\_vdo check to inside it, at which point we
have already looked up the altmode device so we can check for this too.
Doing this check here also ensures that vdm\_state gets set to
VDM\_STATE\_DONE if it was VDM\_STATE\_BUSY, even if we end up with
responding with PD\_MSG\_CTRL\_NOT\_SUPP later.
Note that tcpm\_handle\_vdm\_request() was already sending
PD\_MSG\_CTRL\_NOT\_SUPP in some circumstances, after moving the nr\_snk\_vdo
check the same error-path is now taken when that check fails. So that
we have only one error-path for this and not two. Replace the
tcpm\_queue\_message(PD\_MSG\_CTRL\_NOT\_SUPP) used by the existing error-path
with the more robust tcpm\_pd\_handle\_msg() from the (now removed) second
error-path.

s390/pci: fix use after free of zpci\_dev
[ Upstream commit 2a671f77ee49f3e78997b77fdee139467ff6a598 ]
The struct pci\_dev uses reference counting but zPCI assumed erroneously
that the last reference would always be the local reference after
calling pci\_stop\_and\_remove\_bus\_device(). This is usually the case but
not how reference counting works and thus inherently fragile.
In fact one case where this causes a NULL pointer dereference when on an
SRIOV device the function 0 was hot unplugged before another function of
the same multi-function device. In this case the second function's
pdev->sriov->dev reference keeps the struct pci\_dev of function 0 alive
even after the unplug. This bug was previously hidden by the fact that
we were leaking the struct pci\_dev which in turn means that it always
outlived the struct zpci\_dev. This was fixed in commit 0b13525c20fe
("s390/pci: fix leak of PCI device structure") exposing the broken
behavior.
Fix this by accounting for the long living reference a struct pci\_dev
has to its underlying struct zpci\_dev via the zbus->function[] array and
only release that in pcibios\_release\_device() ensuring that the struct
pci\_dev is not left with a dangling reference. This is a minimal fix in
the future it would probably better to use fine grained reference
counting for struct zpci\_dev.

btrfs: prevent rename2 from exchanging a subvol with a directory from different parents

Cross-rename lacks a check when that would prevent exchanging a
directory and subvolume from different parent subvolume. This causes
data inconsistencies and is caught before commit by tree-checker,
turning the filesystem to read-only.
Calling the renameat2 with RENAME\_EXCHANGE flags like
renameat2(AT\_FDCWD, namesrc, AT\_FDCWD, namedest, (1 << 1))
on two paths:
namesrc = dir1/subvol1/dir2
namedest = subvol2/subvol3

Add the missing check for new\_ino so that all non-subvolumes must reside

exchange two subvolumes from any parents as the directory representing a
subvolume is only a logical link and does not have any other structures
related to the parent subvolume, unlike files, directories etc, that
are always in the inode namespace of the parent subvolume.

mmc: sdhci-iproc: Cap min clock frequency on BCM2711
[ Upstream commit c9107dd0b851777d7e134420baf13a5c5343bc16 ]
There is a known bug on BCM2711's SDHCI core integration where the
controller will hang when the difference between the core clock and the
bus clock is too great. Specifically this can be reproduced under the
following conditions:
- No SD card plugged in, polling thread is running, probing cards at
100 kHz.
- BCM2711's core clock configured at 500MHz or more.
So set 200 kHz as the minimum clock frequency available for that board.

ipack: tpci200: fix memory leak in the tpci200\_register
[ Upstream commit 50f05bd114a46a74726e432bf81079d3f13a55b7 ]
The error handling code in tpci200\_register does not free interface\_regs
allocated by ioremap and the current version of error handling code is
problematic.
Fix this by refactoring the error handling code and free interface\_regs
when necessary.

ipack: tpci200: fix many double free issues in tpci200\_pci\_probe
[ Upstream commit 57a1681095f912239c7fb4d66683ab0425973838 ]
The function tpci200\_register called by tpci200\_install and
tpci200\_unregister called by tpci200\_uninstall are in pair. However,
tpci200\_unregister has some cleanup operations not in the
tpci200\_register. So the error handling code of tpci200\_pci\_probe has
many different double free issues.
Fix this problem by moving those cleanup operations out of
tpci200\_unregister, into tpci200\_pci\_remove and reverting
the previous commit 9272e5d0028d ("ipack/carriers/tpci200:
Fix a double free in tpci200\_pci\_probe").

slimbus: messaging: check for valid transaction id
[ Upstream commit a263c1ff6abe0e66712f40d595bbddc7a35907f8 ]
In some usecases transaction ids are dynamically allocated inside
the controller driver after sending the messages which have generic

for a single pm\_runtime\_get() in slim\_do\_transfer()

The problem was the "trace(read\_max,count)" where the "count" should be
"$count" as "onmax()" only handles variables (although it really should be
able to figure out that "count" is a field of sys\_enter\_read). But there's
a path that does not find the variable and ends up passing a NULL for the
event, which ends up getting passed to "strcmp()".
Add a check for NULL to return and error on the command with:
# cat error\_log

Command: hist:keys=common\_pid:count=count:onmax($count).trace(read\_max,count)

tracing: define needed config DYNAMIC\_FTRACE\_WITH\_ARGS
[ Upstream commit 12f9951d3f311acb1d4ffe8e839bc2c07983546f ]
Commit 2860cd8a2353 ("livepatch: Use the default ftrace\_ops instead of
REGS when ARGS is available") intends to enable config LIVEPATCH when
ftrace with ARGS is available. However, the chain of configs to enable
LIVEPATCH is incomplete, as HAVE\_DYNAMIC\_FTRACE\_WITH\_ARGS is available,
but the definition of DYNAMIC\_FTRACE\_WITH\_ARGS, combining DYNAMIC\_FTRACE
and HAVE\_DYNAMIC\_FTRACE\_WITH\_ARGS, needed to enable LIVEPATCH, is missing
in the commit.
Fortunately, ./scripts/checkkconfigsymbols.py detects this and warns:
DYNAMIC\_FTRACE\_WITH\_ARGS
Referencing files: kernel/livepatch/Kconfig
So, define the config DYNAMIC\_FTRACE\_WITH\_ARGS analogously to the already
existing similar configs, DYNAMIC\_FTRACE\_WITH\_REGS and
DYNAMIC\_FTRACE\_WITH\_DIRECT\_CALLS, in ./kernel/trace/Kconfig to connect the
chain of configs.

cfi: Use rcu\_read\_{un}lock\_sched\_notrace
[ Upstream commit 14c4c8e41511aa8fba7fb239b20b6539b5bce201 ]
If rcu\_read\_lock\_sched tracing is enabled, the tracing subsystem can
perform a jump which needs to be checked by CFI. For example, stm\_ftrace
source is enabled as a module and hooks into enabled ftrace events. This
can cause an recursive loop where find\_shadow\_check\_fn ->
rcu\_read\_lock\_sched -> (call to stm\_ftrace generates cfi slowpath) ->
find\_shadow\_check\_fn -> rcu\_read\_lock\_sched -> ...
To avoid the recursion, either the ftrace codes needs to be marked with
\_\_no\_cfi or CFI should not trace. Use the "\_notrace" in CFI to avoid
tracing so that CFI can guard ftrace.

arm64: clean vdso & vdso32 files

commit a5b8ca97fbf8 ("arm64: do not descend to vdso directories twice")
changes the cleaning behavior of arm64's vdso files, in that vdso.lds,
vdso.so, and vdso.so.dbg are not removed upon a 'make clean/mrproper':
$ make defconfig ARCH=arm64
$ make ARCH=arm64
$ make mrproper ARCH=arm64
$ git clean -nxdf
Would remove arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/vdso.lds
Would remove arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/vdso.so
Would remove arch/arm64/kernel/vdso/vdso.so.dbg
To remedy this, manually descend into arch/arm64/kernel/vdso upon
cleaning.
After this commit:
$ make defconfig ARCH=arm64
$ make ARCH=arm64
$ make mrproper ARCH=arm64
$ git clean -nxdf
Similar results are obtained for the vdso32 equivalent.

clk: qcom: gdsc: Ensure regulator init state matches GDSC state
[ Upstream commit 9711759a87a041705148161b937ec847048d882e ]
As GDSCs are registered and found to be already enabled gdsc\_init()
ensures that 1) the kernel state matches the hardware state, and 2)
votable GDSCs are properly enabled from this master as well.
But as the (optional) supply regulator is enabled deep into
gdsc\_toggle\_logic(), which is only executed for votable GDSCs, the
kernel's state of the regulator might not match the hardware. The
regulator might be automatically turned off if no other users are
present or the next call to gdsc\_disable() would cause an unbalanced
regulator\_disable().
Given that the votable case deals with an already enabled GDSC, most of
gdsc\_enable() and gdsc\_toggle\_logic() can be skipped. Reduce it to just
clearing the SW\_COLLAPSE\_MASK and enabling hardware control to simply
call regulator\_enable() in both cases.
The enablement of hardware control seems to be an independent property
from the GDSC being enabled, so this is moved outside that conditional
segment.
Lastly, as the propagation of ALWAYS\_ON to GENPD\_FLAG\_ALWAYS\_ON needs to
happen regardless of the initial state this is grouped together with the
other sc->pd updates at the end of the function.

mmc: dw\_mmc: Fix hang on data CRC error
[ Upstream commit 25f8203b4be1937c4939bb98623e67dcfd7da4d1 ]
When a Data CRC interrupt is received, the driver disables the DMA, then
sends the stop/abort command and then waits for Data Transfer Over.
However, sometimes, when a data CRC error is received in the middle of a
multi-block write transfer, the Data Transfer Over interrupt is never
received, and the driver hangs and never completes the request.
The driver sets the BMOD.SWR bit (SDMMC\_IDMAC\_SWRESET) when stopping the
DMA, but according to the manual CMD.STOP\_ABORT\_CMD should be programmed
"before assertion of SWR". Do these operations in the recommended
order. With this change the Data Transfer Over is always received
correctly in my tests.

iommu/dma: Fix leak in non-contiguous API
[ Upstream commit 0fbea680540108b09db7b26d9f4d24236d58a6ad ]
Currently, iommu\_dma\_alloc\_noncontiguous() allocates a
struct dma\_sgt\_handle object to hold some state needed for
iommu\_dma\_free\_noncontiguous().
However, the handle is neither freed nor returned explicitly by
the ->alloc\_noncontiguous method, and therefore seems leaked.
This was found by code inspection, so please review carefully and test.
As a side note, it appears the struct dma\_sgt\_handle type is exposed
to users of the DMA-API by linux/dma-map-ops.h, but is has no users
or functions returning the type explicitly.
This may indicate it's a good idea to move the struct dma\_sgt\_handle type
to drivers/iommu/dma-iommu.c. The decision is left to maintainers :-)

net: dpaa2-switch: disable the control interface on error path
[ Upstream commit cd0a719fbd702eb4b455a6ad986483750125588a ]
Currently dpaa2\_switch\_takedown has a funny name and does not do the
opposite of dpaa2\_switch\_init, which makes probing fail when we need to
handle an -EPROBE\_DEFER.
A sketch of what dpaa2\_switch\_init does:
dpsw\_open
dpaa2\_switch\_detect\_features
dpsw\_reset
for (i = 0; i < ethsw->sw\_attr.num\_ifs; i++) {
dpsw\_if\_disable
dpsw\_if\_set\_stp
dpsw\_vlan\_remove\_if\_untagged
dpsw\_if\_set\_tci
dpsw\_vlan\_remove\_if
}
dpsw\_vlan\_remove
alloc\_ordered\_workqueue
dpsw\_fdb\_remove
dpaa2\_switch\_ctrl\_if\_setup
When dpaa2\_switch\_takedown is called from the error path of
dpaa2\_switch\_probe(), the control interface, enabled by
dpaa2\_switch\_ctrl\_if\_setup from dpaa2\_switch\_init, remains enabled,
because dpaa2\_switch\_takedown does not call
dpaa2\_switch\_ctrl\_if\_teardown.
Since dpaa2\_switch\_probe might fail due to EPROBE\_DEFER of a PHY, this
means that a second probe of the driver will happen with the control
interface directly enabled.
This will trigger a second error:
[ 93.273528] fsl\_dpaa2\_switch dpsw.0: dpsw\_ctrl\_if\_set\_pools() failed
[ 93.281966] fsl\_dpaa2\_switch dpsw.0: fsl\_mc\_driver\_probe failed: -13
[ 93.288323] fsl\_dpaa2\_switch: probe of dpsw.0 failed with error -13
Which if we investigate the /dev/dpaa2\_mc\_console log, we find out is
caused by:
[E, ctrl\_if\_set\_pools:2211, DPMNG] ctrl\_if must be disabled
So make dpaa2\_switch\_takedown do the opposite of dpaa2\_switch\_init (in
reasonable limits, no reason to change STP state, re-add VLANs etc), and
rename it to something more conventional, like dpaa2\_switch\_teardown.

i40e: Fix ATR queue selection
[ Upstream commit a222be597e316389f9f8c26033352c124ce93056 ]
Without this patch, ATR does not work. Receive/transmit uses queue
selection based on SW DCB hashing method.
If traffic classes are not configured for PF, then use
netdev\_pick\_tx function for selecting queue for packet transmission.
Instead of calling i40e\_swdcb\_skb\_tx\_hash, call netdev\_pick\_tx,
which ensures that packet is transmitted/received from CPU that is
running the application.
Reproduction steps:
1. Load i40e driver
2. Map each MSI interrupt of i40e port for each CPU
3. Disable ntuple, enable ATR i.e.:
ethtool -K $interface ntuple off
ethtool --set-priv-flags $interface flow-director-atr
4. Run application that is generating traffic and is bound to a
single CPU, i.e.:
taskset -c 9 netperf -H 1.1.1.1 -t TCP\_RR -l 10
5. Observe behavior:
Application's traffic should be restricted to the CPU provided in
taskset.

PCI/sysfs: Use correct variable for the legacy\_mem sysfs object
[ Upstream commit 045a9277b5615846c7b662ffaba84e781f08a172 ]
Two legacy PCI sysfs objects "legacy\_io" and "legacy\_mem" were updated
to use an unified address space in the commit 636b21b50152 ("PCI: Revoke
mappings like devmem"). This allows for revocations to be managed from
a single place when drivers want to take over and mmap() a /dev/mem
range.
Following the update, both of the sysfs objects should leverage the
iomem\_get\_mapping() function to get an appropriate address range, but
only the "legacy\_io" has been correctly updated - the second attribute
seems to be using a wrong variable to pass the iomem\_get\_mapping()
function to.
Thus, correct the variable name used so that the "legacy\_mem" sysfs
object would also correctly call the iomem\_get\_mapping() function.

mptcp: full fully established support after ADD\_ADDR
[ Upstream commit 67b12f792d5eaeb8b4fca3b2053e6b819eb3bf0f ]
If directly after an MP\_CAPABLE 3WHS, the client receives an ADD\_ADDR
with HMAC from the server, it is enough to switch to a "fully
established" mode because it has received more MPTCP options.
It was then OK to enable the "fully\_established" flag on the MPTCP
socket. Still, best to check if the ADD\_ADDR looks valid by looking if
it contains an HMAC (no 'echo' bit). If an ADD\_ADDR echo is received
while we are not in "fully established" mode, it is strange and then
we should not switch to this mode now.
But that is not enough. On one hand, the path-manager has be notified
the state has changed. On the other hand, the "fully\_established" flag
on the subflow socket should be turned on as well not to re-send the
MP\_CAPABLE 3rd ACK content with the next ACK.

net: mscc: ocelot: allow forwarding from bridge ports to the tag\_8021q CPU port
[ Upstream commit c1930148a3941f891ddbd76fceaa4e10a957ccf2 ]
Currently we are unable to ping a bridge on top of a felix switch which
uses the ocelot-8021q tagger. The packets are dropped on the ingress of
the user port and the 'drop\_local' counter increments (the counter which
denotes drops due to no valid destinations).
Dumping the PGID tables, it becomes clear that the PGID\_SRC of the user
port is zero, so it has no valid destinations.
But looking at the code, the cpu\_fwd\_mask (the bit mask of DSA tag\_8021q
ports) is clearly missing from the forwarding mask of ports that are
under a bridge. So this has always been broken.
Looking at the version history of the patch, in v7
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20210125220333.1004365-12-olteanv@gmail.com/
the code looked like this:
/\* Standalone ports forward only to DSA tag\_8021q CPU ports \*/
unsigned long mask = cpu\_fwd\_mask;
(...)
} else if (ocelot->bridge\_fwd\_mask & BIT(port)) {
mask |= ocelot->bridge\_fwd\_mask & ~BIT(port);
while in v8 (the merged version)
https://patchwork.kernel.org/project/netdevbpf/patch/20210129010009.3959398-12-olteanv@gmail.com/
it looked like this:
unsigned long mask;
(...)
} else if (ocelot->bridge\_fwd\_mask & BIT(port)) {
mask = ocelot->bridge\_fwd\_mask & ~BIT(port);
So the breakage was introduced between v7 and v8 of the patch.

net: mdio-mux: Handle -EPROBE\_DEFER correctly
[ Upstream commit 7bd0cef5dac685f09ef8b0b2a7748ff42d284dc7 ]
When registering mdiobus children, if we get an -EPROBE\_DEFER, we shouldn't
ignore it and continue registering the rest of the mdiobus children. This
would permanently prevent the deferring child mdiobus from working instead
of reattempting it in the future. So, if a child mdiobus needs to be
reattempted in the future, defer the entire mdio-mux initialization.
This fixes the issue where PHYs sitting under the mdio-mux aren't
initialized correctly if the PHY's interrupt controller is not yet ready
when the mdio-mux is being probed. Additional context in the link below.

virtio-net: use NETIF\_F\_GRO\_HW instead of NETIF\_F\_LRO
[ Upstream commit dbcf24d153884439dad30484a0e3f02350692e4c ]
Commit a02e8964eaf92 ("virtio-net: ethtool configurable LRO")
maps LRO to virtio guest offloading features and allows the
administrator to enable and disable those features via ethtool.
This leads to several issues:
- For a device that doesn't support control guest offloads, the "LRO"
can't be disabled triggering WARN in dev\_disable\_lro() when turning
off LRO or when enabling forwarding bridging etc.
- For a device that supports control guest offloads, the guest
offloads are disabled in cases of bridging, forwarding etc slowing
down the traffic.
Fix this by using NETIF\_F\_GRO\_HW instead. Though the spec does not
guarantee packets to be re-segmented as the original ones,
we can add that to the spec, possibly with a flag for devices to
differentiate between GRO and LRO.
Further, we never advertised LRO historically before a02e8964eaf92
("virtio-net: ethtool configurable LRO") and so bridged/forwarded
configs effectively always relied on virtio receive offloads behaving
like GRO - thus even if this breaks any configs it is at least not
a regression.

vrf: Reset skb conntrack connection on VRF rcv
[ Upstream commit 09e856d54bda5f288ef8437a90ab2b9b3eab83d1 ]
To fix the "reverse-NAT" for replies.
When a packet is sent over a VRF, the POST\_ROUTING hooks are called
twice: Once from the VRF interface, and once from the "actual"
interface the packet will be sent from:
1) First SNAT: l3mdev\_l3\_out() -> vrf\_l3\_out() -> .. -> vrf\_output\_direct()
This causes the POST\_ROUTING hooks to run.
2) Second SNAT: 'ip\_output()' calls POST\_ROUTING hooks again.
Similarly for replies, first ip\_rcv() calls PRE\_ROUTING hooks, and
second vrf\_l3\_rcv() calls them again.
As an example, consider the following SNAT rule:
> iptables -t nat -A POSTROUTING -p udp -m udp --dport 53 -j SNAT --to-source 2.2.2.2 -o vrf\_1
In this case sending over a VRF will create 2 conntrack entries.
The first is from the VRF interface, which performs the IP SNAT.
The second will run the SNAT, but since the "expected reply" will remain
the same, conntrack randomizes the source port of the packet:
e..g With a socket bound to 1.1.1.1:10000, sending to 3.3.3.3:53, the conntrack
rules are:
udp 17 29 src=2.2.2.2 dst=3.3.3.3 sport=10000 dport=53 packets=1 bytes=68 [UNREPLIED] src=3.3.3.3 dst=2.2.2.2 sport=53 dport=61033 packets=0 bytes=0 mark=0 use=1
udp 17 29 src=1.1.1.1 dst=3.3.3.3 sport=10000 dport=53 packets=1 bytes=68 [UNREPLIED] src=3.3.3.3 dst=2.2.2.2 sport=53 dport=10000 packets=0 bytes=0 mark=0 use=1
i.e. First SNAT IP from 1.1.1.1 --> 2.2.2.2, and second the src port is
SNAT-ed from 10000 --> 61033.
But when a reply is sent (3.3.3.3:53 -> 2.2.2.2:61033) only the later
conntrack entry is matched:
udp 17 29 src=2.2.2.2 dst=3.3.3.3 sport=10000 dport=53 packets=1 bytes=68 src=3.3.3.3 dst=2.2.2.2 sport=53 dport=61033 packets=1 bytes=49 mark=0 use=1
udp 17 28 src=1.1.1.1 dst=3.3.3.3 sport=10000 dport=53 packets=1 bytes=68 [UNREPLIED] src=3.3.3.3 dst=2.2.2.2 sport=53 dport=10000 packets=0 bytes=0 mark=0 use=1
And a "port 61033 unreachable" ICMP packet is sent back.
The issue is that when PRE\_ROUTING hooks are called from vrf\_l3\_rcv(),
the skb already has a conntrack flow attached to it, which means
nf\_conntrack\_in() will not resolve the flow again.
This means only the dest port is "reverse-NATed" (61033 -> 10000) but
the dest IP remains 2.2.2.2, and since the socket is bound to 1.1.1.1 it's
not received.
This can be verified by logging the 4-tuple of the packet in '\_\_udp4\_lib\_rcv()'.
The fix is then to reset the flow when skb is received on a VRF, to let
conntrack resolve the flow again (which now will hit the earlier flow).

running 'bash ./repro'):

bnxt\_en: Add missing DMA memory barriers
[ Upstream commit 828affc27ed43441bd1efdaf4e07e96dd43a0362 ]
Each completion ring entry has a valid bit to indicate that the entry
contains a valid completion event. The driver's main poll loop
\_\_bnxt\_poll\_work() has the proper dma\_rmb() to make sure the valid
bit of the next entry has been checked before proceeding further.
But when we call bnxt\_rx\_pkt() to process the RX event, the RX
completion event consists of two completion entries and only the
first entry has been checked to be valid. We need the same barrier
after checking the next completion entry. Add missing dma\_rmb()
barriers in bnxt\_rx\_pkt() and other similar locations.

bnxt: make sure xmit\_more + errors does not miss doorbells
[ Upstream commit e8d8c5d80f5e9d4586c68061b62c642752289095 ]
skbs are freed on error and not put on the ring. We may, however,
be in a situation where we're freeing the last skb of a batch,
and there is a doorbell ring pending because of xmit\_more() being
true earlier. Make sure we ring the door bell in such situations.
Since errors are rare don't pay attention to xmit\_more() and just
always flush the pending frames.
The busy case should be safe to be left alone because it can
only happen if start\_xmit races with completions and they
both enable the queue. In that case the kick can't be pending.
Noticed while reading the code.

bnxt: don't lock the tx queue from napi poll
[ Upstream commit 3c603136c9f82833813af77185618de5af67676c ]
We can't take the tx lock from the napi poll routine, because
netpoll can poll napi at any moment, including with the tx lock
already held.
The tx lock is protecting against two paths - the disable
path, and (as Michael points out) the NETDEV\_TX\_BUSY case
which may occur if NAPI completions race with start\_xmit
and both decide to re-enable the queue.
For the disable/ifdown path use synchronize\_net() to make sure
closing the device does not race we restarting the queues.
Annotate accesses to dev\_state against data races.
For the NAPI cleanup vs start\_xmit path - appropriate barriers
are already in place in the main spot where Tx queue is stopped
but we need to do the same careful dance in the TX\_BUSY case.

bpf: Clear zext\_dst of dead insns
[ Upstream commit 45c709f8c71b525b51988e782febe84ce933e7e0 ]
"access skb fields ok" verifier test fails on s390 with the "verifier
bug. zext\_dst is set, but no reg is defined" message. The first insns
of the test prog are ...
0: 61 01 00 00 00 00 00 00 ldxw %r0,[%r1+0]
8: 35 00 00 01 00 00 00 00 jge %r0,0,1
10: 61 01 00 08 00 00 00 00 ldxw %r0,[%r1+8]
... and the 3rd one is dead (this does not look intentional to me, but
this is a separate topic).
sanitize\_dead\_code() converts dead insns into "ja -1", but keeps
zext\_dst. When opt\_subreg\_zext\_lo32\_rnd\_hi32() tries to parse such
an insn, it sees this discrepancy and bails. This problem can be seen
only with JITs whose bpf\_jit\_needs\_zext() returns true.
Fix by clearning dead insns' zext\_dst.
The commits that contributed to this problem are:
1. 5aa5bd14c5f8 ("bpf: add initial suite for selftests"), which
introduced the test with the dead code.
2. 5327ed3d44b7 ("bpf: verifier: mark verified-insn with
sub-register zext flag"), which introduced the zext\_dst flag.
3. 83a2881903f3 ("bpf: Account for BPF\_FETCH in
insn\_has\_def32()"), which introduced the sanity check.
4. 9183671af6db ("bpf: Fix leakage under speculation on
mispredicted branches"), which bisect points to.
It's best to fix this on stable branches that contain the second one,
since that's the point where the inconsistency was introduced.

vdpa/mlx5: Avoid destroying MR on empty iotlb
[ Upstream commit 08dbd5660232bede7916d8568003012c1182cc9a ]
The current code treats an empty iotlb provdied in set\_map() as a
special case and destroy the memory region object. This must not be done
since the virtqueue objects reference this MR. Doing so will cause the
driver unload to emit errors and log timeouts caused by the firmware
complaining on busy resources.
This patch treats an empty iotlb as any other change of mapping. In this
case, mlx5\_vdpa\_create\_mr() will fail and the entire set\_map() call to
fail.
This issue has not been encountered before but was seen to occur in a
non-official version of qemu. Since qemu is a userspace program, the
driver must protect against such case.

cpufreq: armada-37xx: forbid cpufreq for 1.2 GHz variant
[ Upstream commit 484f2b7c61b9ae58cc00c5127bcbcd9177af8dfe ]
The 1.2 GHz variant of the Armada 3720 SOC is unstable with DVFS: when
the SOC boots, the WTMI firmware sets clocks and AVS values that work
correctly with 1.2 GHz CPU frequency, but random crashes occur once
cpufreq driver starts scaling.
We do not know currently what is the reason:
- it may be that the voltage value for L0 for 1.2 GHz variant provided
by the vendor in the OTP is simply incorrect when scaling is used,
- it may be that some delay is needed somewhere,
- it may be something else.
The most sane solution now seems to be to simply forbid the cpufreq
driver on 1.2 GHz variant.

get -EINVAL from of\_property\_count\_elems\_of\_size() but it should not

drm/amd/display: workaround for hard hang on HPD on native DP
[ Upstream commit c4152b297d56d3696ad0a9003169bc5b98ad7b72 ]
[Why]
HPD disable and enable sequences are not mutually exclusive
on Linux. For HPDs that spans over 1s (i.e. HPD low = 1s),
part of the disable sequence (specifically, a request to SMU
to lower refclk) could come right before the call to PHY
enable, causing DMUB to access an unresponsive PHY
and thus a hard hang on the system.
[How]
Disable 48mhz refclk off on native DP.

[ Upstream commit f0f82e2476f6adb9c7a0135cfab8091456990c99 ]
After adding physical volumes to a volume group through vgextend, the
kernel will rescan the partitions. This in turn will cause the device
capacity to be queried.
If the device status is set to offline through sysfs at this time, READ
CAPACITY command will return a result which the host byte is
DID\_NO\_CONNECT, and the capacity of the device will be set to zero in
read\_capacity\_error(). After setting device status back to running, the
capacity of the device will remain stuck at zero.
Fix this issue by rescanning device when the device state changes to
SDEV\_RUNNING.

1. of\_dma\_find\_controller() would find the dma\_router
2. ofdma->of\_dma\_xlate() would fail and returned NULL
3. -ENODEV is returned as error code
with this patch we would return in this case the correct -EPROBE\_DEFER and
the client can try to request the channel later.

ARM: dts: am43x-epos-evm: Reduce i2c0 bus speed for tps65218
[ Upstream commit 20a6b3fd8e2e2c063b25fbf2ee74d86b898e5087 ]
Based on the latest timing specifications for the TPS65218 from the data
sheet, http://www.ti.com/lit/ds/symlink/tps65218.pdf, document SLDS206
from November 2014, we must change the i2c bus speed to better fit within
the minimum high SCL time required for proper i2c transfer.
When running at 400khz, measurements show that SCL spends
0.8125 uS/1.666 uS high/low which violates the requirement for minimum
high period of SCL provided in datasheet Table 7.6 which is 1 uS.
Switching to 100khz gives us 5 uS/5 uS high/low which both fall above
the minimum given values for 100 khz, 4.0 uS/4.7 uS high/low.
Without this patch occasionally a voltage set operation from the kernel
will appear to have worked but the actual voltage reflected on the PMIC
will not have updated, causing problems especially with cpufreq that may
update to a higher OPP without actually raising the voltage on DCDC2,
leading to a hang.

dmaengine: xilinx\_dma: Fix read-after-free bug when terminating transfers
[ Upstream commit 7dd2dd4ff9f3abda601f22b9d01441a0869d20d7 ]
When user calls dmaengine\_terminate\_sync, the driver will clean up any
remaining descriptors for all the pending or active transfers that had
previously been submitted. However, this might happen whilst the tasklet is
invoking the DMA callback for the last finished transfer, so by the time it
returns and takes over the channel's spinlock, the list of completed
descriptors it was traversing is no longer valid. This leads to a
read-after-free situation.
Fix it by signalling whether a user-triggered termination has happened by
means of a boolean variable.

USB: core: Fix incorrect pipe calculation in do\_proc\_control()
[ Upstream commit b0863f1927323110e3d0d69f6adb6a91018a9a3c ]
When the user submits a control URB via usbfs, the user supplies the
bRequestType value and the kernel uses it to compute the pipe value.
However, do\_proc\_control() performs this computation incorrectly in
the case where the bRequestType direction bit is set to USB\_DIR\_IN and
the URB's transfer length is 0: The pipe's direction is also set to IN
but it should be OUT, which is the direction the actual transfer will
use regardless of bRequestType.
Commit 5cc59c418fde ("USB: core: WARN if pipe direction != setup
packet direction") added a check to compare the direction bit in the
pipe value to a control URB's actual direction and to WARN if they are
different. This can be triggered by the incorrect computation
mentioned above, as found by syzbot.
This patch fixes the computation, thus avoiding the WARNing.

USB: core: Avoid WARNings for 0-length descriptor requests
[ Upstream commit 60dfe484cef45293e631b3a6e8995f1689818172 ]
The USB core has utility routines to retrieve various types of
descriptors. These routines will now provoke a WARN if they are asked
to retrieve 0 bytes (USB "receive" requests must not have zero
length), so avert this by checking the size argument at the start.

io\_uring: Use WRITE\_ONCE() when writing to sq\_flags
[ Upstream commit 20c0b380f971e7d48f5d978bc27d827f7eabb21a ]
The compiler should be forbidden from any strange optimization for async
writes to user visible data-structures. Without proper protection, the
compiler can cause write-tearing or invent writes that would confuse the
userspace.
However, there are writes to sq\_flags which are not protected by
WRITE\_ONCE(). Use WRITE\_ONCE() for these writes.
This is purely a theoretical issue. Presumably, any compiler is very
unlikely to do such optimizations.

commit 2394e628738933aa014093d93093030f6232946d upstream.
Erasing an AMD linear flash card (AM29F016D) crashes after the first
sector has been erased. Likewise, writing to it crashes after two bytes
have been written. The reason is a missing check for a null pointer -
the cmdset\_priv field is not set for this type of card.
