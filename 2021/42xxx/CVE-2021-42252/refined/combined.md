soc: aspeed: lpc-ctrl: Fix boundary check for mmapThe check mixes pages (vm\_pgoff) with bytes (vm\_start, vm\_end) on one
side of the comparison, and uses resource address (rather than just the
resource size) on the other side of the comparison.
This can allow malicious userspace to easily bypass the boundary check and
map pages that are located outside memory-region reserved by the driver.

drm/panfrost: Clamp lock region to Bifrost minimum
commit bd7ffbc3ca12629aeb66fb9e28cf42b7f37e3e3b upstream.
When locking a region, we currently clamp to a PAGE\_SIZE as the minimum
lock region. While this is valid for Midgard, it is invalid for Bifrost,
where the minimum locking size is 8x larger than the 4k page size. Add a
hardware definition for the minimum lock region size (corresponding to
KBASE\_LOCK\_REGION\_MIN\_SIZE\_LOG2 in kbase) and respect it.

drm/panfrost: Use u64 for size in lock\_region
commit a77b58825d7221d4a45c47881c35a47ba003aa73 upstream.
Mali virtual addresses are 48-bit. Use a u64 instead of size\_t to ensure
we can express the "lock everything" condition as ~0ULL without
overflow. This code was silently broken on any platform where a size\_t
is less than 48-bits; in particular, it was broken on 32-bit armv7
platforms which remain in use with panfrost. (Mainly RK3288)

drm/panfrost: Simplify lock\_region calculation
commit b5fab345654c603c07525100d744498f28786929 upstream.
In lock\_region, simplify the calculation of the region\_width parameter.
This field is the size, but encoded as ceil(log2(size)) - 1.
ceil(log2(size)) may be computed directly as fls(size - 1). However, we
want to use the 64-bit versions as the amount to lock can exceed
32-bits.
This avoids undefined (and completely wrong) behaviour when locking all
memory (size ~0). In this case, the old code would "round up" ~0 to the
nearest page, overflowing to 0. Since fls(0) == 0, this would calculate
a region width of 10 + 0 = 10. But then the code would shift by
(region\_width - 11) = -1. As shifting by a negative number is undefined,
UBSAN flags the bug. Of course, even if it were defined the behaviour is
wrong, instead of locking all memory almost none would get locked.
The new form of the calculation corrects this special case and avoids
the undefined behaviour.

drm/ttm: Fix ttm\_bo\_move\_memcpy() for subclassed struct ttm\_resource
commit efcefc7127290e7e9fa98dea029163ad8eda8fb3 upstream.
The code was making a copy of a struct ttm\_resource. However,
recently the struct ttm\_resources were allowed to be subclassed and
also were allowed to be malloced, hence the driver could end up assuming
the copy we handed it was subclassed and worse, the original could have
been freed at this point.
Fix this by using the original struct ttm\_resource before it is
potentially freed in ttm\_bo\_move\_sync\_cleanup()

drm/msm/disp/dpu1: add safe lut config in dpu driver
commit 5bccb945f38b2aff334619b23b50bb0a6a9995a5 upstream.
Add safe lut configuration for all the targets in dpu
driver as per QOS recommendation.
Issue reported on SC7280:
With wait-for-safe feature in smmu enabled, RT client
buffer levels are checked to be safe before smmu invalidation.
Since display was always set to unsafe it was delaying the
invalidaiton process thus impacting the performance on NRT clients
such as eMMC and NVMe.
Validated this change on SC7280, With this change eMMC performance
has improved significantly.
Changes in v2:
- Add fixes tag (Sai)
- CC stable kernel (Dimtry)
Changes in v3:
- Correct fixes tag with appropriate hash (stephen)
- Resend patch adding reviewed by tag
- Resend patch adding correct format for pushing into stable tree (Greg)

commit 7fdc48cc63a30fa3480d18bdd8c5fff2b9b15212 upstream.
Jobs can be in-flight when the file descriptor is closed (either because
the process did not terminate properly, or because it didn't wait for
all GPU jobs to be finished), and apparently panfrost\_job\_close() does
not cancel already running jobs. Let's refcount the MMU context object
so it's lifetime is no longer bound to the FD lifetime and running jobs
can finish properly without generating spurious page faults.

drm/dp\_mst: Fix return code on sideband message failure
commit 92bd92c44d0d9be5dcbcda315b4be4b909ed9740 upstream.
Commit 2f015ec6eab6 ("drm/dp\_mst: Add sideband down request tracing +
selftests") added some debug code for sideband message tracing. But
it seems to have unintentionally changed the behavior on sideband message
failure. It catches and returns failure only if DRM\_UT\_DP is enabled.
Otherwise it ignores the error code and returns success. So on an MST
unplug, the caller is unaware that the clear payload message failed and
ends up waiting for 4 seconds for the response. Fixes the issue by
returning the proper error code.
Changes in V2:
-- Revise commit text as review comment
-- add Fixes text
Changes in V3:
-- remove "unlikely" optimization

net: stmmac: Fix overall budget calculation for rxtx\_napi
commit 81d0885d68ec427e62044cf46a400c9958ea0092 upstream.
tx\_done is not used for napi\_complete\_done(). Thus, NAPI busy polling
mechanism by gro\_flush\_timeout and napi\_defer\_hard\_irqs will not able
be triggered after a packet is transmitted when there is no receive
packet.
Fix this by taking the maximum value between tx\_done and rx\_done as
overall budget completed by the rxtx NAPI poll to ensure XDP Tx ZC
operation is continuously polling for next Tx frame. This gives
benefit of lower packet submission processing latency and jitter
under XDP Tx ZC mode.
Performance of tx-only using xdp-sock on Intel ADL-S platform is
the same with and without this patch.

memcg: enable accounting for pids in nested pid namespaces
commit fab827dbee8c2e06ca4ba000fa6c48bcf9054aba upstream.
Commit 5d097056c9a0 ("kmemcg: account certain kmem allocations to memcg")
enabled memcg accounting for pids allocated from init\_pid\_ns.pid\_cachep,
but forgot to adjust the setting for nested pid namespaces. As a result,
pid memory is not accounted exactly where it is really needed, inside
memcg-limited containers with their own pid namespaces.
Pid was one the first kernel objects enabled for memcg accounting.
init\_pid\_ns.pid\_cachep marked by SLAB\_ACCOUNT and we can expect that any
new pids in the system are memcg-accounted.
Though recently I've noticed that it is wrong. nested pid namespaces
creates own slab caches for pid objects, nested pids have increased size
because contain id both for all parent and for own pid namespaces. The
problem is that these slab caches are \_NOT\_ marked by SLAB\_ACCOUNT, as a
result any pids allocated in nested pid namespaces are not
memcg-accounted.
Pid struct in nested pid namespace consumes up to 500 bytes memory, 100000
such objects gives us up to ~50Mb unaccounted memory, this allow container
to exceed assigned memcg limits.

mm/mempolicy: fix a race between offset\_il\_node and mpol\_rebind\_task
commit 276aeee1c5fc00df700f0782060beae126600472 upstream.
Servers happened below panic:
Kernel version:5.4.56
BUG: unable to handle page fault for address: 0000000000002c48
RIP: 0010:\_\_next\_zones\_zonelist+0x1d/0x40

\_\_do\_page\_fault+0x288/0x500
do\_page\_fault+0x30/0x110
page\_fault+0x3e/0x50
The reason for the panic is that MAX\_NUMNODES is passed in the third
parameter in \_\_alloc\_pages\_nodemask(preferred\_nid). So access to
zonelist->zoneref->zone\_idx in \_\_next\_zones\_zonelist will cause a panic.
In offset\_il\_node(), first\_node() returns nid from pol->v.nodes, after
this other threads may chang pol->v.nodes before next\_node(). This race
condition will let next\_node return MAX\_NUMNODES. So put pol->nodes in
a local variable.
The race condition is between offset\_il\_node and cpuset\_change\_task\_nodemask:
CPU0: CPU1:
alloc\_pages\_vma()
interleave\_nid(pol,)
offset\_il\_node(pol,)

mm,vmscan: fix divide by zero in get\_scan\_count
commit 32d4f4b782bb8f0ceb78c6b5dc46eb577ae25bf7 upstream.
Commit f56ce412a59d ("mm: memcontrol: fix occasional OOMs due to
proportional memory.low reclaim") introduced a divide by zero corner
case when oomd is being used in combination with cgroup memory.low
protection.
When oomd decides to kill a cgroup, it will force the cgroup memory to
be reclaimed after killing the tasks, by writing to the memory.max file
for that cgroup, forcing the remaining page cache and reclaimable slab
to be reclaimed down to zero.
Previously, on cgroups with some memory.low protection that would result
in the memory being reclaimed down to the memory.low limit, or likely
not at all, having the page cache reclaimed asynchronously later.
With f56ce412a59d the oomd write to memory.max tries to reclaim all the
way down to zero, which may race with another reclaimer, to the point of
ending up with the divide by zero below.
This patch implements the obvious fix.

mm/hugetlb: initialize hugetlb\_usage in mm\_init
commit 13db8c50477d83ad3e3b9b0ae247e5cd833a7ae4 upstream.
After fork, the child process will get incorrect (2x) hugetlb\_usage. If
a process uses 5 2MB hugetlb pages in an anonymous mapping,
HugetlbPages: 10240 kB
and then forks, the child will show,
HugetlbPages: 20480 kB
The reason for double the amount is because hugetlb\_usage will be copied
from the parent and then increased when we copy page tables from parent
to child. Child will have 2x actual usage.
Fix this by adding hugetlb\_count\_init in mm\_init.

mm/hmm: bypass devmap pte when all pfn requested flags are fulfilled
commit 4b42fb213678d2b6a9eeea92a9be200f23e49583 upstream.
Previously, we noticed the one rpma example was failed[1] since commit
36f30e486dce ("IB/core: Improve ODP to use hmm\_range\_fault()"), where it
will use ODP feature to do RDMA WRITE between fsdax files.
After digging into the code, we found hmm\_vma\_handle\_pte() will still
return EFAULT even though all the its requesting flags has been
fulfilled. That's because a DAX page will be marked as (\_PAGE\_SPECIAL |
PAGE\_DEVMAP) by pte\_mkdevmap().

mm/memory\_hotplug: use "unsigned long" for PFN in zone\_for\_pfn\_range()
commit 7cf209ba8a86410939a24cb1aeb279479a7e0ca6 upstream.
Patch series "mm/memory\_hotplug: preparatory patches for new online policy and memory"
These are all cleanups and one fix previously sent as part of [1]:
[PATCH v1 00/12] mm/memory\_hotplug: "auto-movable" online policy and memory
groups.
These patches make sense even without the other series, therefore I pulled
them out to make the other series easier to digest.
[1] https://lkml.kernel.org/r/20210607195430.48228-1-david@redhat.com
This patch (of 4):
Checkpatch complained on a follow-up patch that we are using "unsigned"
here, which defaults to "unsigned int" and checkpatch is correct.
As we will search for a fitting zone using the wrong pfn, we might end
up onlining memory to one of the special kernel zones, such as ZONE\_DMA,
which can end badly as the onlined memory does not satisfy properties of
these zones.
Use "unsigned long" instead, just as we do in other places when handling
PFNs. This can bite us once we have physical addresses in the range of
multiple TB.

hugetlb: fix hugetlb cgroup refcounting during vma split
commit 09a26e832705fdb7a9484495b71a05e0bbc65207 upstream.
Guillaume Morin reported hitting the following WARNING followed by GPF or
NULL pointer deference either in cgroups\_destroy or in the kill\_css path.:

Upon further examination, it was discovered that the css structure was
associated with hugetlb reservations.
For private hugetlb mappings the vma points to a reserve map that
contains a pointer to the css. At mmap time, reservations are set up
and a reference to the css is taken. This reference is dropped in the
vma close operation; hugetlb\_vm\_op\_close. However, if a vma is split no
additional reference to the css is taken yet hugetlb\_vm\_op\_close will be
called twice for the split vma resulting in an underflow.
Fix by taking another reference in hugetlb\_vm\_op\_open. Note that the
reference is only taken for the owner of the reserve map. In the more
common fork case, the pointer to the reserve map is cleared for
non-owning vmas.

mm: fix panic caused by \_\_page\_handle\_poison()
commit f87060d345232c7d855167a43faf006e24afa999 upstream.
In commit 510d25c92ec4 ("mm/hwpoison: disable pcp for
page\_handle\_poison()"), \_\_page\_handle\_poison() was introduced, and if we
mark:
RET\_A = dissolve\_free\_huge\_page();
RET\_B = take\_page\_off\_buddy();
then \_\_page\_handle\_poison was supposed to return TRUE When RET\_A == 0 &&
RET\_B == TRUE
But since it failed to take care the case when RET\_A is -EBUSY or -ENOMEM,
and just return the ret as a bool which actually become TRUE, it break the
original logic.
The following result is a huge page in freelist but was
referenced as poisoned, and lead into the final panic:
kernel BUG at mm/internal.h:95!

s390/topology: fix topology information when calling cpu hotplug notifiers
commit a052096bdd6809eeab809202726634d1ac975aa1 upstream.
The cpu hotplug notifiers are called without updating the core/thread
masks when a new CPU is added. This causes problems with code setting
up data structures in a cpu hotplug notifier, and relying on that later
in normal code.
This caused a crash in the new core scheduling code (SCHED\_CORE),
where rq->core was set up in a notifier depending on cpu masks.
To fix this, add a cpu\_setup\_mask which is used in update\_cpu\_masks()
instead of the cpu\_online\_mask to determine whether the cpu masks should
be set for a certain cpu. Also move update\_cpu\_masks() to update the
masks before calling notify\_cpu\_starting() so that the notifiers are
seeing the updated masks.

s390/pv: fix the forcing of the swiotlb
commit 93ebb6828723b8aef114415c4dc3518342f7dcad upstream.
Since commit 903cd0f315fe ("swiotlb: Use is\_swiotlb\_force\_bounce for
swiotlb data bouncing") if code sets swiotlb\_force it needs to do so
before the swiotlb is initialised. Otherwise
io\_tlb\_default\_mem->force\_bounce will not get set to true, and devices
that use (the default) swiotlb will not bounce despite switolb\_force
having the value of SWIOTLB\_FORCE.
Let us restore swiotlb functionality for PV by fulfilling this new
requirement.
This change addresses what turned out to be a fragility in
commit 64e1f0c531d1 ("s390/mm: force swiotlb for protected
virtualization"), which ain't exactly broken in its original context,
but could give us some more headache if people backport the broken
change and forget this fix.

commit f34ee9cb2c5ac5af426fee6fa4591a34d187e696 upstream.
In the numa=off kernel command-line configuration init\_chip\_info() loops
around the number of chips and attempts to copy the cpumask of that node
which is NULL for all iterations after the first chip.
Hence, store the cpu mask for each chip instead of derving cpumask from
node while populating the "chips" struct array and copy that to the
chips[i].mask

scsi: qla2xxx: Sync queue idx with queue\_pair\_map idx
commit c8fadf019964d0eb1da410ba8b629494d3339db9 upstream.
The first invocation of function find\_first\_zero\_bit will return 0 and
queue\_id gets set to 0.
An index of queue\_pair\_map also gets set to 0.
qpair\_id = find\_first\_zero\_bit(ha->qpair\_qid\_map, ha->max\_qpairs);
set\_bit(qpair\_id, ha->qpair\_qid\_map);
ha->queue\_pair\_map[qpair\_id] = qpair;
In the alloc\_queue callback driver checks the map, if queue is already
allocated:
ha->queue\_pair\_map[qidx]
This works fine as long as max\_qpairs is greater than nvme\_max\_hw\_queues(8)
since the size of the queue\_pair\_map is equal to max\_qpair. In case nr\_cpus
is less than 8, max\_qpairs is less than 8. This creates wrong value
returned as qpair.

printk/console: Check consistent sequence number when handling race in console\_unlock()
commit 11e4b63abbe23872b45f325a7c6c8b7f9ff42cad upstream.
The standard printk() tries to flush the message to the console
immediately. It tries to take the console lock. If the lock is
already taken then the current owner is responsible for flushing
even the new message.
There is a small race window between checking whether a new message is
available and releasing the console lock. It is solved by re-checking
the state after releasing the console lock. If the check is positive
then console\_unlock() tries to take the lock again and process the new
message as well.
The commit 996e966640ddea7b535c ("printk: remove logbuf\_lock") causes that
console\_seq is not longer read atomically. As a result, the re-check might
be done with an inconsistent 64-bit index.
Solve it by using the last sequence number that has been checked under
the console lock. In the worst case, it will take the lock again only
to realized that the new message has already been proceed. But it
was possible even before.
The variable next\_seq is marked as \_\_maybe\_unused to call down compiler
warning when CONFIG\_PRINTK is not defined.

parisc: Fix compile failure when building 64-bit kernel natively
commit 5f6e0fe01b6b33894cf6f61b359ab5a6d2b7674e upstream.
Commit 23243c1ace9f ("arch: use cross\_compiling to check whether it is
a cross build or not") broke 64-bit parisc builds on 32-bit parisc
systems.
Helge mentioned:
- 64-bit parisc userspace is not supported yet [1]
- hppa gcc does not support "-m64" flag [2]
That means, parisc developers working on a 32-bit parisc machine need
to use hppa64-linux-gnu-gcc (cross compiler) for building the 64-bit
parisc kernel.
After the offending commit, gcc is used in such a case because
both $(SRCARCH) and $(SUBARCH) are 'parisc', hence cross\_compiling is
unset.
A correct way is to introduce ARCH=parisc64 because building the 64-bit
parisc kernel on a 32-bit parisc system is not exactly a native build,
but rather a semi-cross build.

parisc: fix crash with signals and alloca
commit 030f653078316a9cc9ca6bd1b0234dcf858be35d upstream.
I was debugging some crashes on parisc and I found out that there is a
crash possibility if a function using alloca is interrupted by a signal.
The reason for the crash is that the gcc alloca implementation leaves
garbage in the upper 32 bits of the sp register. This normally doesn't
matter (the upper bits are ignored because the PSW W-bit is clear),
however the signal delivery routine in the kernel uses full 64 bits of sp
and it fails with -EFAULT if the upper 32 bits are not zero.
I created this program that demonstrates the problem:
#include
#include
#include
#include
static \_\_attribute\_\_((noinline,noclone)) void aa(int \*size)
{
void \* volatile p = alloca(-\*size);
while (1) ;
}
static void handler(int sig)
{
write(1, "signal delivered\n", 17);
\_exit(0);
}
int main(void)
{
int size = -0x100;
signal(SIGALRM, handler);
alarm(1);
aa(&size);
}
If you compile it with optimizations, it will crash.
The "aa" function has this disassembly:
000106a0 :
106a0: 08 03 02 41 copy r3,r1
106a4: 08 1e 02 43 copy sp,r3
106a8: 6f c1 00 80 stw,ma r1,40(sp)
106ac: 37 dc 3f c1 ldo -20(sp),ret0
106b0: 0c 7c 12 90 stw ret0,8(r3)
106b4: 0f 40 10 9c ldw 0(r26),ret0 ; ret0 = 0x00000000FFFFFF00
106b8: 97 9c 00 7e subi 3f,ret0,ret0 ; ret0 = 0xFFFFFFFF0000013F
106bc: d7 80 1c 1a depwi 0,31,6,ret0 ; ret0 = 0xFFFFFFFF00000100

106c4: e8 1f 1f f7 b,l,n 106c4 ,r0
This patch fixes the bug by truncating the "usp" variable to 32 bits.

The problem is that gpio\_free() can sleep and the cfg\_soc() can be

--> ath\_reset\_internal() takes &sc->sc\_pcu\_lock spin lock
--> ath9k\_hw\_reset()
--> ath9k\_hw\_gpio\_request\_in()
--> ath9k\_hw\_gpio\_request()
--> ath9k\_hw\_gpio\_cfg\_soc()
Remove gpio\_free(), use error message instead, so we should make sure
there is no GPIO conflict.
Also remove ath9k\_hw\_gpio\_free() from ath9k\_hw\_apply\_gpio\_override(),
as gpio\_mask will never be set for SOC chips.

[ Upstream commit 23151b9ae79e3bc4f6a0c4cd3a7f355f68dad128 ]
Bad header can have large length field which can cause OOB.
cptr is the last bytes for read, and the eeprom is parsed
from high to low address. The OOB, triggered by the condition
length > cptr could cause memory error with a read on
negative index.
There are some sanity check around length, but it is not
compared with cptr (the remaining bytes). Here, the
corrupted/bad EEPROM can cause panic.
I was able to reproduce the crash, but I cannot find the

In line 849 (#1), "mlx5dr\_htbl\_put(cur\_htbl);" drops the reference to
cur\_htbl and may cause cur\_htbl to be freed.
However, cur\_htbl is subsequently used in the next line, which may result
in an use-after-free bug.
Fix this by calling mlx5dr\_err() before the cur\_htbl is put.

iwlwifi: mvm: don't schedule the roc\_done\_wk if it is already running
[ Upstream commit a76b57311b1a247e31b055872d021c38707dc3a8 ]
When P2P roc is removed, the IWL\_MVM\_STATUS\_NEED\_FLUSH\_P2P bit is set
to indicate to iwl\_mvm\_roc\_done\_wk() that the removed roc is a P2P
one, so it will flush the broadcast station and not the aux station.
However, since setting this bit and scheduling the worker is done
in roc ended flow as well as in case the roc is removed, there is
a race where the worker has already started running (but did not
test this bit yet) and then it is scheduled again. In this case,
the first run of the worker will clear this bit, and thus the second
run will find it already cleared and will try to flush and remove
the aux station by mistake.
Fix it by scheduling the worker only if this bit is not yet set. In
case this bit is already set, the worker is either running or
scheduled, so there is no need to re-schedule it.

iwlwifi: mvm: avoid static queue number aliasing
[ Upstream commit c6ce1c74ef2923b8ffd85f7f8b486f804f343b39 ]
When TVQM is enabled (iwl\_mvm\_has\_new\_tx\_api() is true), then
queue numbers are just sequentially assigned 0, 1, 2, ...
Prior to TVQM, in DQA, there were some statically allocated
queue numbers:
\* IWL\_MVM\_DQA\_AUX\_QUEUE == 1,
\* both IWL\_MVM\_DQA\_INJECT\_MONITOR\_QUEUE and
IWL\_MVM\_DQA\_P2P\_DEVICE\_QUEUE == 2, and
\* IWL\_MVM\_DQA\_AP\_PROBE\_RESP\_QUEUE == 9.
Now, these values are assigned to the members mvm->aux\_queue,
mvm->snif\_queue, mvm->probe\_queue and mvm->p2p\_dev\_queue by
default. Normally, this doesn't really matter, and if TVQM is
in fact available we override them to the real values after
allocating a queue for use there.
However, this allocation doesn't always happen. For example,
for mvm->p2p\_dev\_queue (== 2) it only happens when the P2P
Device interface is started, if any. If it's not started, the
value in mvm->p2p\_dev\_queue remains 2. This wouldn't really
matter all that much if it weren't for iwl\_mvm\_is\_static\_queue()
which checks a queue number against one of those four static
numbers.
Now, if no P2P Device or monitor interface is added then queue
2 may be dynamically allocated, yet alias mvm->p2p\_dev\_queue or
mvm->snif\_queue, and thus iwl\_mvm\_is\_static\_queue() erroneously
returns true for it. If it then gets full, all interface queues
are stopped, instead of just backpressuring against the one TXQ
that's really the only affected one.
This clearly can lead to issues, as everything is stopped even
if just a single TXQ filled its corresponding HW queue, if it
happens to have an appropriate number (2 or 9, AUX is always
reassigned.) Due to a mac80211 bug, this also led to a situation
in which the queues remained stopped across a deauthentication
and then attempts to connect to a new AP started failing, but
that's fixed separately.
Fix all of this by simply initializing the queue numbers to
the invalid value until they're used, if TVQM is enabled, and
also setting them back to that value when the queues are later
freed again.

nfs: don't atempt blocking locks on nfs reexports
[ Upstream commit f657f8eef3ff870552c9fd2839e0061046f44618 ]
NFS implements blocking locks by blocking inside its lock method. In
the reexport case, this blocks the nfs server thread, which could lead
to deadlocks since an nfs server thread might be required to unlock the
conflicting lock. It also causes a crash, since the nfs server thread
assumes it can free the lock when its lm\_notify lock callback is called.
Ideal would be to make the nfs lock method return without blocking in
this case, but for now it works just not to attempt blocking locks. The
difference is just that the original client will have to poll (as it
does in the v4.0 case) instead of getting a callback when the lock's
available.

On systems with multiple SH per SE compute\_static\_thread\_mgmt\_se#
is split into independent masks, one for each SH, in the upper and
lower 16 bits. We need to detect this and apply cu masking to each
SH. The cu mask bits are assigned first to each SE, then to
alternate SHs, then finally to higher CU id. This ensures that
the maximum number of SPIs are engaged as early as possible while
balancing CU assignment to each SH.
v2: Use max SH/SE rather than max SH in cu\_per\_sh.
v3: Fix comment blocks, ensure se\_mask is initially zero filled,
and correctly assign se.sh.cu positions to unset bits in cu\_mask.

ASoC: soc-pcm: protect BE dailink state changes in trigger
[ Upstream commit 0c75fc7193387776c10f7c7b440d93496e3d5e21 ]
When more than one FE is connected to a BE, e.g. in a mixing use case,
the BE can be triggered multiple times when the FE are opened/started
concurrently. This race condition is problematic in the case of
SoundWire BE dailinks, and this is not desirable in a general
case. The code carefully checks when the BE can be stopped or
hw\_free'ed, but the trigger code does not use any mutual exclusion.
Fix by using the same spinlock already used to check FE states, and
set the state before the trigger. In case of errors, the initial
state will be restored.
This patch does not change how the triggers are handled, it only makes
sure the states are handled in critical sections.

usb: xhci-mtk: Do not use xhci's virt\_dev in drop\_endpoint
[ Upstream commit b8731209958a1dffccc2888121f4c0280c990550 ]
xhci-mtk depends on xhci's internal virt\_dev when it retrieves its
internal data from usb\_host\_endpoint both in add\_endpoint and
drop\_endpoint callbacks. But when setup packet was retired by
transaction errors in xhci\_setup\_device() path, a virt\_dev for the slot
is newly created with real\_port 0. This leads to xhci-mtks's NULL pointer
dereference from drop\_endpoint callback as xhci-mtk assumes that virt\_dev's
real\_port is always started from one. The similar problems were addressed
by [1] but that can't cover the failure cases from setup\_device.
This patch drops the usages of xhci's virt\_dev in xhci-mtk's drop\_endpoint
callback by adopting rhashtable for searching mtk's schedule entity
from a given usb\_host\_endpoint pointer instead of searching a linked list.
So mtk's drop\_endpoint callback doesn't have to rely on virt\_dev at all.

vhci\_hcd accepts port resets only when the device doesn't have

assigned/used state and vhci\_hcd rejects it leaving the port in
a stuck state.
This problem was found when a blue-tooth or xbox wireless dongle
was passed through using usbip.

specific to this bug report. Fix the problem with a change to
honor reset requests when device is in used state (VDEV\_ST\_USED).

Revert "USB: xhci: fix U1/U2 handling for hardware with XHCI\_INTEL\_HOST quirk set"
[ Upstream commit 2847c46c61486fd8bca9136a6e27177212e78c69 ]
This reverts commit 5d5323a6f3625f101dbfa94ba3ef7706cce38760.
That commit effectively disabled Intel host initiated U1/U2 lpm for devices
with periodic endpoints.
Before that commit we disabled host initiated U1/U2 lpm if the exit latency
was larger than any periodic endpoint service interval, this is according
to xhci spec xhci 1.1 specification section 4.23.5.2
After that commit we incorrectly checked that service interval was smaller
than U1/U2 inactivity timeout. This is not relevant, and can't happen for
Intel hosts as previously set U1/U2 timeout = 105% \* service interval.
Patch claimed it solved cases where devices can't be enumerated because of
bandwidth issues. This might be true but it's a side effect of accidentally
turning off lpm.
exit latency calculations have been revised since then

samples: pktgen: fix to print when terminated normally
[ Upstream commit c0e9422c4e6ca9abd4bd6e1598400c7231eb600b ]
Currently, most pktgen samples print the execution result when the
program is terminated normally. However, sample03 doesn't work
appropriately.
This is results of samples:
# DEV=eth0 DEST\_IP=10.1.0.1 DST\_MAC=00:11:22:33:44:55 ./pktgen\_sample04\_many\_flows.sh -n 1
Running... ctrl^C to stop
Device: eth0@0
Result: OK: 19(c5+d13) usec, 1 (60byte,0frags)
51762pps 24Mb/sec (24845760bps) errors: 0
# DEV=eth0 DEST\_IP=10.1.0.1 DST\_MAC=00:11:22:33:44:55 ./pktgen\_sample03\_burst\_single\_flow.sh -n 1
Running... ctrl^C to stop
The reason why it doesn't print the execution result when the program is
terminated usually is that sample03 doesn't call the function which
prints the result, unlike other samples.
So, this commit solves this issue by calling the function before
termination. Also, this commit changes control\_c function to
print\_result to maintain consistency with other samples.

mmc: core: Return correct emmc response in case of ioctl error
[ Upstream commit e72a55f2e5ddcfb3dce0701caf925ce435b87682 ]
When a read/write command is sent via ioctl to the kernel,
and the command fails, the actual error response of the emmc
is not sent to the user.
IOCTL read/write tests are carried out using commands
17 (Single BLock Read), 24 (Single Block Write),
18 (Multi Block Read), 25 (Multi Block Write)
The tests are carried out on a 64Gb emmc device. All of these
tests try to access an "out of range" sector address (0x09B2FFFF).
It is seen that without the patch the response received by the user
is not OUT\_OF\_RANGE error (R1 response 31st bit is not set) as per
JEDEC specification. After applying the patch proper response is seen.
This is because the function returns without copying the response to
the user in case of failure. This patch fixes the issue.
Hence, this memcpy is required whether we get an error response or not.
Therefor it is moved up from the current position up to immediately
after we have called mmc\_wait\_for\_req().
The test code and the output of only the CMD17 is included in the
commit to limit the message length.
CMD17 (Test Code Snippet):
==========================
printf("Forming CMD%d\n", opt\_idx);
/\* single block read \*/
cmd.blksz = 512;
cmd.blocks = 1;
cmd.write\_flag = 0;

//cmd.arg = atoi(argv[3]);
cmd.arg = 0x09B2FFFF;
/\* Expecting response R1B \*/
cmd.flags = MMC\_RSP\_SPI\_R1 | MMC\_RSP\_R1 | MMC\_CMD\_ADTC;
memset(data, 0, sizeof(\_\_u8) \* 512);
mmc\_ioc\_cmd\_set\_data(cmd, data);

mmc: rtsx\_pci: Fix long reads when clock is prescaled
[ Upstream commit 3ac5e45291f3f0d699a721357380d4593bc2dcb3 ]
For unexplained reasons, the prescaler register for this device needs to
be cleared (set to 1) while performing a data read or else the command
will hang. This does not appear to affect the real clock rate sent out
on the bus, so I assume it's purely to work around a hardware bug.
During normal operation, the prescaler is already set to 1, so nothing
needs to be done. However, in "initial mode" (which is used for sub-MHz
clock speeds, like the core sets while enumerating cards), it's set to
128 and so we need to reset it during data reads. We currently fail to
do this for long reads.
This has no functional affect on the driver's operation currently
written, as the MMC core always sets a clock above 1MHz before
attempting any long reads. However, the core could conceivably set any
clock speed at any time and the driver should still work, so I think
this fix is worthwhile.
I personally encountered this issue while performing data recovery on an
external chip. My connections had poor signal integrity, so I modified
the core code to reduce the clock speed. Without this change, I saw the
card enumerate but was unable to actually read any data.
Writes don't seem to work in the situation described above even with
this change (and even if the workaround is extended to encompass data
write commands). I was not able to find a way to get them working.

In additional the flow in that sequence can be improved by first

btrfs: remove racy and unnecessary inode transaction update when using no-holes
[ Upstream commit cceaa89f02f15f232391ae4be214137b0a0285c0 ]
When using the NO\_HOLES feature and expanding the size of an inode, we
update the inode's last\_trans, last\_sub\_trans and last\_log\_commit fields
at maybe\_insert\_hole() so that a fsync does know that the inode needs to
be logged (by making sure that btrfs\_inode\_in\_log() returns false). This
happens for expanding truncate operations, buffered writes, direct IO
writes and when cloning extents to an offset greater than the inode's
i\_size.
However the way we do it is racy, because in between setting the inode's
last\_sub\_trans and last\_log\_commit fields, the log transaction ID that was
assigned to last\_sub\_trans might be committed before we read the root's
last\_log\_commit and assign that value to last\_log\_commit. If that happens
it would make a future call to btrfs\_inode\_in\_log() return true. This is
a race that should be extremely unlikely to be hit in practice, and it is
the same that was described by commit bc0939fcfab0d7 ("btrfs: fix race
between marking inode needs to be logged and log syncing").
The fix would simply be to set last\_log\_commit to the value we assigned
to last\_sub\_trans minus 1, like it was done in that commit. However
updating these two fields plus the last\_trans field is pointless here
because all the callers of btrfs\_cont\_expand() (which is the only
caller of maybe\_insert\_hole()) always call btrfs\_set\_inode\_last\_trans()
or btrfs\_update\_inode() after calling btrfs\_cont\_expand(). Calling either
btrfs\_set\_inode\_last\_trans() or btrfs\_update\_inode() guarantees that the
next fsync will log the inode, as it makes btrfs\_inode\_in\_log() return
false.
So just remove the code that explicitly sets the inode's last\_trans,
last\_sub\_trans and last\_log\_commit fields.

As far as I can tell, this is a bug with the m68kmmu architecture, not
with my driver:
The CONFIG\_ISA\_DMA\_API option is provided for coldfire, which implements it,
but dragonball also sets the option as a side-effect, without actually
implementing
the interfaces. The patch below should fix it.

In current wow flow, driver calls rtw\_wow\_fw\_start and sleep for 100ms,
to wait firmware finish preliminary work and then update the value of
WOWLAN\_WAKE\_REASON register to zero. But later firmware will start wow
function with power-saving mode, in which mode the value of
WOWLAN\_WAKE\_REASON register is 0xea. So driver may get 0xea value and
return fail. We use read\_poll\_timeout instead to check the value to avoid
this issue.

lockd: lockd server-side shouldn't set fl\_ops

Locks have two sets of op arrays, fl\_lmops for the lock manager (lockd
or nfsd), fl\_ops for the filesystem. The server-side lockd code has
been setting its own fl\_ops, which leads to confusion (and crashes) in
the reexport case, where the filesystem expects to be the only one
setting fl\_ops.
And there's no reason for it that I can see-the lm\_get/put\_owner ops do
the same job.

gfs2: Don't call dlm after protocol is unmounted
[ Upstream commit d1340f80f0b8066321b499a376780da00560e857 ]
In the gfs2 withdraw sequence, the dlm protocol is unmounted with a call
to lm\_unmount. After a withdraw, users are allowed to unmount the
withdrawn file system. But at that point we may still have glocks left
over that we need to free via unmount's call to gfs2\_gl\_hash\_clear.
These glocks may have never been completed because of whatever problem
caused the withdraw (IO errors or whatever).
Before this patch, function gdlm\_put\_lock would still try to call into
dlm to unlock these leftover glocks, which resulted in dlm returning
-EINVAL because the lock space was abandoned. These glocks were never
freed because there was no mechanism after that to free them.
This patch adds a check to gdlm\_put\_lock to see if the locking protocol
was inactive (DFL\_UNMOUNT flag) and if so, free the glock and not
make the invalid call into dlm.
I could have combined this "if" with the one that follows, related to
leftover glock LVBs, but I felt the code was more readable with its own
if clause.

ASoC: rsnd: adg: clearly handle clock error / NULL case
[ Upstream commit cc64c390b215b404524725a94857d6fb58d9a62a ]
This driver is assuming that all adg->clk[i] is not NULL.
Because of this prerequisites, for\_each\_rsnd\_clk() is possible to work
for all clk without checking NULL. In other words, all adg->clk[i]
should not NULL.
Some SoC might doesn't have clk\_a/b/c/i. devm\_clk\_get() returns error in
such case. This driver calls rsnd\_adg\_null\_clk\_get() and use null\_clk
instead of NULL in such cases.
But devm\_clk\_get() might returns NULL even though such clocks exist, but
it doesn't mean error (user deliberately chose to disable the feature).
NULL clk itself is not error from clk point of view, but is error from
this driver point of view because it is not assuming such case.
But current code is using IS\_ERR() which doesn't care NULL.
This driver uses IS\_ERR\_OR\_NULL() instead of IS\_ERR() for clk check.
And it uses ERR\_CAST() to clarify null\_clk error.
One concern here is that it unconditionally uses null\_clk if clk\_a/b/c/i
was error. It is correct if it doesn't exist, but is not correct if it
returns error even though it exist.
It needs to check "clock-names" from DT before calling devm\_clk\_get() to
handling such case. But let's assume it is overkill so far.

net: Fix offloading indirect devices dependency on qdisc order creation
[ Upstream commit 74fc4f828769cca1c3be89ea92cb88feaa27ef52 ]
Currently, when creating an ingress qdisc on an indirect device before
the driver registered for callbacks, the driver will not have a chance
to register its filter configuration callbacks.
To fix that, modify the code such that it keeps track of all the ingress
qdiscs that call flow\_indr\_dev\_setup\_offload(). When a driver calls
flow\_indr\_dev\_register(), go through the list of tracked ingress qdiscs
and call the driver callback entry point so as to give it a chance to
register its callback.

selftests/bpf: Fix flaky send\_signal test
[ Upstream commit b16ac5bf732a5e23d164cf908ec7742d6a6120d3 ]
libbpf CI has reported send\_signal test is flaky although
I am not able to reproduce it in my local environment.
But I am able to reproduce with on-demand libbpf CI ([1]).
Through code analysis, the following is possible reason.
The failed subtest runs bpf program in softirq environment.
Since bpf\_send\_signal() only sends to a fork of "test\_progs"
process. If the underlying current task is
not "test\_progs", bpf\_send\_signal() will not be triggered
and the subtest will fail.
To reduce the chances where the underlying process is not
the intended one, this patch boosted scheduling priority to
-20 (highest allowed by setpriority() call). And I did
10 runs with on-demand libbpf CI with this patch and I
didn't observe any failures.

As follow-up to the discussion with Jakub Kicinski about iavf locking

The locking logic is kept as is, just a drop-in replacement of

The only difference is that the mutexes will be destroyed before the

tcp: enable data-less, empty-cookie SYN with TFO\_SERVER\_COOKIE\_NOT\_REQD
[ Upstream commit e3faa49bcecdfcc80e94dd75709d6acb1a5d89f6 ]
Since the original TFO server code was implemented in commit
168a8f58059a22feb9e9a2dcc1b8053dbbbc12ef ("tcp: TCP Fast Open Server -
main code path") the TFO server code has supported the sysctl bit flag
TFO\_SERVER\_COOKIE\_NOT\_REQD. Currently, when the TFO\_SERVER\_ENABLE and
TFO\_SERVER\_COOKIE\_NOT\_REQD sysctl bit flags are set, a server connection
will accept a SYN with N bytes of data (N > 0) that has no TFO cookie,
create a new fast open connection, process the incoming data in the SYN,
and make the connection ready for accepting. After accepting, the
connection is ready for read()/recvmsg() to read the N bytes of data in
the SYN, ready for write()/sendmsg() calls and data transmissions to
transmit data.
This commit changes an edge case in this feature by changing this
behavior to apply to (N >= 0) bytes of data in the SYN rather than only
(N > 0) bytes of data in the SYN. Now, a server will accept a data-less
SYN without a TFO cookie if TFO\_SERVER\_COOKIE\_NOT\_REQD is set.
Caveat! While this enables a new kind of TFO (data-less empty-cookie
SYN), some firewall rules setup may not work if they assume such packets
are not legit TFOs and will filter them.

iomap: pass writeback errors to the mapping
[ Upstream commit b69eea82d37d9ee7cfb3bf05103549dd4ed5ffc3 ]
Modern-day mapping\_set\_error has the ability to squash the usual
negative error code into something appropriate for long-term storage in
a struct address\_space -- ENOSPC becomes AS\_ENOSPC, and everything else
becomes EIO. iomap squashes /everything/ to EIO, just as XFS did before
that, but this doesn't make sense.
Fix this by making it so that we can pass ENOSPC to userspace when
writeback fails due to space problems.

Bluetooth: Fix race condition in handling NOP command
[ Upstream commit ecb71f2566673553bc067e5b0036756871d0b9d3 ]
For NOP command, need to cancel work scheduled on cmd\_timer,
on receiving command status or commmand complete event.
Below use case might lead to race condition multiple when NOP
commands are queued sequentially:
hci\_cmd\_work() {
if (atomic\_read(&hdev->cmd\_cnt) {
.
.
.
atomic\_dec(&hdev->cmd\_cnt);
hci\_send\_frame(hdev,...);
schedule\_delayed\_work(&hdev->cmd\_timer,...);
}
}
On receiving event for first NOP, the work scheduled on hdev->cmd\_timer
is not cancelled and second NOP is dequeued and sent to controller.
While waiting for an event for second NOP command, work scheduled on
cmd\_timer for the first NOP can get scheduled, resulting in sending third
NOP command (sending back to back NOP commands). This might
cause issues at controller side (like memory overrun, controller going
unresponsive) resulting in hci tx timeouts, hardware errors etc.
The fix to this issue is to cancel the delayed work scheduled on
cmd\_timer on receiving command status or command complete event for
NOP command (this patch handles NOP command same as any other SIG
command).

nvme: code command\_id with a genctr for use-after-free validation
[ Upstream commit e7006de6c23803799be000a5dcce4d916a36541a ]
We cannot detect a (perhaps buggy) controller that is sending us
a completion for a request that was already completed (for example
sending a completion twice), this phenomenon was seen in the wild
a few times.
So to protect against this, we use the upper 4 msbits of the nvme sqe
command\_id to use as a 4-bit generation counter and verify it matches
the existing request generation that is incrementing on every execution.
The 16-bit command\_id structure now is constructed by:
| xxxx | xxxxxxxxxxxx |
gen request tag
This means that we are giving up some possible queue depth as 12 bits
allow for a maximum queue depth of 4095 instead of 65536, however we
never create such long queues anyways so no real harm done.

mac80211: Fix monitor MTU limit so that A-MSDUs get through
[ Upstream commit 79f5962baea74ce1cd4e5949598944bff854b166 ]
The maximum MTU was set to 2304, which is the maximum MSDU size. While
this is valid for normal WLAN interfaces, it is too low for monitor
interfaces. A monitor interface may receive and inject MPDU frames, and
the maximum MPDU frame size is larger than 2304. The MPDU may also
contain an A-MSDU frame, in which case the size may be much larger than
the MTU limit. Since the maximum size of an A-MSDU depends on the PHY
mode of the transmitting STA, it is not possible to set an exact MTU
limit for a monitor interface. Now the maximum MTU for a monitor
interface is unrestricted.

other info that might help us debug this:
Chain exists of:
sk\_lock-AF\_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO\_SCO --> &hdev->lock --> hci\_cb\_list\_lock
Possible unsafe locking scenario:
CPU0 CPU1
---- ----
lock(hci\_cb\_list\_lock);
lock(&hdev->lock);
lock(hci\_cb\_list\_lock);
lock(sk\_lock-AF\_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO\_SCO);
\*\*\* DEADLOCK \*\*\*
The issue is that the lock hierarchy should go from &hdev->lock -->
hci\_cb\_list\_lock --> sk\_lock-AF\_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO\_SCO. For example,
one such call trace is:
hci\_dev\_do\_close():
hci\_dev\_lock();
hci\_conn\_hash\_flush():
hci\_disconn\_cfm():
mutex\_lock(&hci\_cb\_list\_lock);
sco\_disconn\_cfm():
sco\_conn\_del():
lock\_sock(sk);
However, in sco\_sock\_connect, we call lock\_sock before calling
hci\_dev\_lock inside sco\_connect, thus inverting the lock hierarchy.
We fix this by pulling the call to hci\_dev\_lock out from sco\_connect.

Bluetooth: schedule SCO timeouts with delayed\_work
[ Upstream commit ba316be1b6a00db7126ed9a39f9bee434a508043 ]
struct sock.sk\_timer should be used as a sock cleanup timer. However,
SCO uses it to implement sock timeouts.
This causes issues because struct sock.sk\_timer's callback is run in
an IRQ context, and the timer callback function sco\_sock\_timeout takes
a spin lock on the socket. However, other functions such as
sco\_conn\_del and sco\_conn\_ready take the spin lock with interrupts
enabled.
This inconsistent {SOFTIRQ-ON-W} -> {IN-SOFTIRQ-W} lock usage could
lead to deadlocks as reported by Syzbot [1]:
CPU0
----
lock(slock-AF\_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO\_SCO);
lock(slock-AF\_BLUETOOTH-BTPROTO\_SCO);
To fix this, we use delayed work to implement SCO sock timouts
instead. This allows us to avoid taking the spin lock on the socket in
an IRQ context, and corrects the misuse of struct sock.sk\_timer.
As a note, cancel\_delayed\_work is used instead of
cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync in sco\_sock\_set\_timer and
sco\_sock\_clear\_timer to avoid a deadlock. In the future, the call to
bh\_lock\_sock inside sco\_sock\_timeout should be changed to lock\_sock to
synchronize with other functions using lock\_sock. However, since
sco\_sock\_set\_timer and sco\_sock\_clear\_timer are sometimes called under
the locked socket (in sco\_connect and \_\_sco\_sock\_close),
cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync might cause them to sleep until an
sco\_sock\_timeout that has started finishes running. But
sco\_sock\_timeout would also sleep until it can grab the lock\_sock.
Using cancel\_delayed\_work is fine because sco\_sock\_timeout does not
change from run to run, hence there is no functional difference
between:
1. waiting for a timeout to finish running before scheduling another
timeout
2. scheduling another timeout while a timeout is running.

drm: xlnx: zynqmp: release reset to DP controller before accessing DP registers
[ Upstream commit a338619bd76011035d462f0f9e8b2f24d7fe5a1e ]
When insmod zynqmp-dpsub.ko after rmmod it, system will hang with the
error log as below:
root@xilinx-zynqmp:~# insmod zynqmp-dpsub.ko
[ 88.391289] [drm] Initialized zynqmp-dpsub 1.0.0 20130509 for fd4a0000.display on minor 0

[ 94.023404] Console: switching to colour dummy device 80x25
root@xilinx-zynqmp:~# insmod zynqmp-dpsub.ko
This is because that in zynqmp\_dp\_probe it tries to access some DP
registers while the DP controller is still in the reset state. When
running "rmmod zynqmp\_dpsub", zynqmp\_dp\_reset(dp, true) in
zynqmp\_dp\_phy\_exit is called to force the DP controller into the reset
state. Then insmod will call zynqmp\_dp\_probe to program the DP registers,
but at this moment the DP controller hasn't been brought out of the reset
state yet since the function zynqmp\_dp\_reset(dp, false) is called later and
this will result the system hang.
Releasing the reset to DP controller before any read/write operation to it
will fix this issue. And for symmetry, move zynqmp\_dp\_reset() call from
zynqmp\_dp\_phy\_exit() to zynqmp\_dp\_remove().

drm: xlnx: zynqmp\_dpsub: Call pm\_runtime\_get\_sync before setting pixel clock
[ Upstream commit a19effb6dbe5bd1be77a6d68eba04dba8993ffeb ]
The Runtime PM subsystem will force the device "fd4a0000.zynqmp-display"
to enter suspend state while booting if the following conditions are met:
- the usage counter is zero (pm\_runtime\_get\_sync hasn't been called yet)
- no 'active' children (no zynqmp-dp-snd-xx node under dpsub node)
- no other device in the same power domain (dpdma node has no
"power-domains = <&zynqmp\_firmware PD\_DP>" property)
So there is a scenario as below:
1) DP device enters suspend state <- call zynqmp\_gpd\_power\_off
2) zynqmp\_disp\_crtc\_setup\_clock <- configurate register VPLL\_FRAC\_CFG
3) pm\_runtime\_get\_sync <- call zynqmp\_gpd\_power\_on and clear previous
VPLL\_FRAC\_CFG configuration
4) clk\_prepare\_enable(disp->pclk) <- enable failed since VPLL\_FRAC\_CFG
configuration is corrupted
From above, we can see that pm\_runtime\_get\_sync may clear register
VPLL\_FRAC\_CFG configuration and result the failure of clk enabling.
Putting pm\_runtime\_get\_sync at the very beginning of the function
zynqmp\_disp\_crtc\_atomic\_enable can resolve this issue.

appears:
drivers/net/ethernet/stmicro/stmmac/dwmac-ipq806x.o: warning: objtool:
ipq806x\_gmac\_probe() falls through to next function phy\_modes()
This happens because the unreachable annotation in the third switch
statement is not eliminated. The compiler should know that the first
default case would prevent the second and third from being reached as
the comment notes but sanitizer options can make it harder for the
compiler to reason this out.
Help the compiler out by eliminating the unreachable() annotation and
unifying the default case error handling so that there is no objtool
warning, the meaning of the code stays the same, and there is less
duplication.

qfprom\_disable\_fuse\_blowing() disables a bunch of resources,

It works perhaps because the resources are needed only for the
'raw' register space writes, and that the 'conf' space allows
read/writes regardless.
However that makes the code look confusing, so just move the
register writes before turning off the resources in the
function.

misc: sram: Only map reserved areas in Tegra SYSRAM
[ Upstream commit fec29bf04994b478a43a7e60e6dd5ac1f7cb53ae ]
On Tegra186 and later, a portion of the SYSRAM may be reserved for use
by TZ. Non-TZ memory accesses to this portion, including speculative
accesses, trigger SErrors that bring down the system. This does also
happen in practice occasionally (due to speculative accesses).
To fix the issue, add a flag to the SRAM driver to only map the
device tree-specified reserved areas depending on a flag set
based on the compatibility string. This would not affect non-Tegra
systems that rely on the entire thing being memory mapped.
If 64K pages are being used, we cannot exactly map the 4K regions
that are placed in SYSRAM - ioremap code instead aligns to closest
64K pages. However, since in practice the non-accessible memory area
is 64K aligned, these mappings do not overlap with the non-accessible
memory area and things work out.

Handle optional overrun-throttle-ms property as done for 8250\_fsl in commit
6d7f677a2afa ("serial: 8250: Rate limit serial port rx interrupts during
input overruns"). This can be used to rate limit the UART interrupts on
noisy lines that end up producing messages like the following:
ttyS ttyS2: 4 input overrun(s)
At least on droid4, the multiplexed USB and UART port is left to UART mode
by the bootloader for a debug console, and if a USB charger is connected
on boot, we get noise on the UART until the PMIC related drivers for PHY
and charger are loaded.
With this patch and overrun-throttle-ms = <500> we avoid the extra rx
interrupts.

[ Upstream commit f809665ee75fff3f4ea8907f406a66d380aeb184 ]
The range for analog gain mentioned in the datasheet is [0, 480].
The real gain formula mentioned in the datasheet is:
Gain = 512 / (512 – X)
Hence, values larger than 511 clearly makes no sense. The gain
register field is also documented to be of 9-bits in the datasheet.
Certainly, it is enough to infer that, the kernel driver currently
advertises an arbitrary analog gain max. Fix it by rectifying the
value as per the data sheet i.e. 480.

The driver exposes the V4L2\_CID\_VBLANK control in read-only mode and
sets its value to vts\_def - height, where vts\_def is a mode-dependent
value coming from the supported\_modes array. It is set using one of
the following macros defined in the driver:

For the SSP capture, this leads to annoying "SP5-Codec: ASoC: no

close - state 0" errors.
Update the quirks to match what the topology needs, which also allows

bonding: 3ad: fix the concurrency between \_\_bond\_release\_one() and bond\_3ad\_state\_machine\_handler()
[ Upstream commit 220ade77452c15ecb1ab94c3f8aaeb6d033c3582 ]
Some time ago, I reported a calltrace issue
"did not find a suitable aggregator", please see[1].
After a period of analysis and reproduction, I find
that this problem is caused by concurrency.
Before the problem occurs, the bond structure is like follows:
bond0 - slaver0(eth0) - agg0.lag\_ports -> port0 - port1
\
port0
\
slaver1(eth1) - agg1.lag\_ports -> NULL
\
port1
If we run 'ifenslave bond0 -d eth1', the process is like below:
excuting \_\_bond\_release\_one()
|
bond\_upper\_dev\_unlink()[step1]
| | |
| | bond\_3ad\_lacpdu\_recv()
| | ->bond\_3ad\_rx\_indication()
| | spin\_lock\_bh()
| | ->ad\_rx\_machine()
| | ->\_\_record\_pdu()[step2]
| | spin\_unlock\_bh()
| | |
| bond\_3ad\_state\_machine\_handler()
| spin\_lock\_bh()
| ->ad\_port\_selection\_logic()
| ->try to find free aggregator[step3]
| ->try to find suitable aggregator[step4]
| ->did not find a suitable aggregator[step5]
| spin\_unlock\_bh()
| |
| |
bond\_3ad\_unbind\_slave() |
spin\_lock\_bh()
spin\_unlock\_bh()
step1: already removed slaver1(eth1) from list, but port1 remains
step2: receive a lacpdu and update port0
step3: port0 will be removed from agg0.lag\_ports. The struct is
"agg0.lag\_ports -> port1" now, and agg0 is not free. At the
same time, slaver1/agg1 has been removed from the list by step1.
So we can't find a free aggregator now.
step4: can't find suitable aggregator because of step2
step5: cause a calltrace since port->aggregator is NULL
To solve this concurrency problem, put bond\_upper\_dev\_unlink()
after bond\_3ad\_unbind\_slave(). In this way, we can invalid the port
first and skip this port in bond\_3ad\_state\_machine\_handler(). This
eliminates the situation that the slaver has been removed from the
list but the port is still valid.

Bluetooth: skip invalid hci\_sync\_conn\_complete\_evt
[ Upstream commit 92fe24a7db751b80925214ede43f8d2be792ea7b ]
Syzbot reported a corrupted list in kobject\_add\_internal [1]. This
happens when multiple HCI\_EV\_SYNC\_CONN\_COMPLETE event packets with
status 0 are sent for the same HCI connection. This causes us to
register the device more than once which corrupts the kset list.
As this is forbidden behavior, we add a check for whether we're
trying to process the same HCI\_EV\_SYNC\_CONN\_COMPLETE event multiple
times for one connection. If that's the case, the event is invalid, so
we report an error that the device is misbehaving, and ignore the
packet.

libbpf: Fix race when pinning maps in parallel
[ Upstream commit 043c5bb3c4f43670ab4fea0b847373ab42d25f3e ]
When loading in parallel multiple programs which use the same to-be
pinned map, it is possible that two instances of the loader will call
bpf\_object\_\_create\_maps() at the same time. If the map doesn't exist
when both instances call bpf\_object\_\_reuse\_map(), then one of the
instances will fail with EEXIST when calling bpf\_map\_\_pin().
Fix the race by retrying reusing a map if bpf\_map\_\_pin() returns
EEXIST. The fix is similar to the one in iproute2: e4c4685fd6e4 ("bpf:
Fix race condition with map pinning").
Before retrying the pinning, we don't do any special cleaning of an
internal map state. The closer code inspection revealed that it's not
required:
- bpf\_object\_\_create\_map(): map->inner\_map is destroyed after a
successful call, map->fd is closed if pinning fails.
- bpf\_object\_\_populate\_internal\_map(): created map elements is
destroyed upon close(map->fd).
- init\_map\_slots(): slots are freed after their initialization.

samples: bpf: Fix tracex7 error raised on the missing argument
[ Upstream commit 7d07006f05922b95518be403f08ef8437b67aa32 ]
The current behavior of 'tracex7' doesn't consist with other bpf samples
tracex{1..6}. Other samples do not require any argument to run with, but
tracex7 should be run with btrfs device argument. (it should be executed
with test\_override\_return.sh)
Currently, tracex7 doesn't have any description about how to run this
program and raises an unexpected error. And this result might be
confusing since users might not have a hunch about how to run this
program.
// Current behavior
# ./tracex7
sh: 1: Syntax error: word unexpected (expecting ")")
// Fixed behavior
# ./tracex7
ERROR: Run with the btrfs device argument!
In order to fix this error, this commit adds logic to report a message
and exit when running this program with a missing argument.
Additionally in test\_override\_return.sh, there is a problem with
multiple directory(tmpmnt) creation. So in this commit adds a line with
removing the directory with every execution.

serial: 8250: Define RX trigger levels for OxSemi 950 devices
[ Upstream commit d7aff291d069c4418285f3c8ee27b0ff67ce5998 ]
Oxford Semiconductor 950 serial port devices have a 128-byte FIFO and in
the enhanced (650) mode, which we select in `autoconfig\_has\_efr' with
the ECB bit set in the EFR register, they support the receive interrupt
trigger level selectable with FCR bits 7:6 from the set of 16, 32, 112,
120. This applies to the original OX16C950 discrete UART[1] as well as
950 cores embedded into more complex devices.
For these devices we set the default to 112, which sets an excessively
high level of 112 or 7/8 of the FIFO capacity, unlike with other port
types where we choose at most 1/2 of their respective FIFO capacities.
Additionally we don't make the trigger level configurable. Consequently
frequent input overruns happen with high bit rates where hardware flow
control cannot be used (e.g. terminal applications) even with otherwise
highly-performant systems.
Lower the default receive interrupt trigger level to 32 then, and make
it configurable. Document the trigger levels along with other port
types, including the set of 16, 32, 64, 112 for the transmit interrupt
as well[2].

s390: make PCI mio support a machine flag
[ Upstream commit 3322ba0d7bea1e24ae464418626f6a15b69533ab ]
Kernel support for the newer PCI mio instructions can be toggled off
with the pci=nomio command line option which needs to integrate with
common code PCI option parsing. However this option then toggles static
branches which can't be toggled yet in an early\_param() call.
Thus commit 9964f396f1d0 ("s390: fix setting of mio addressing control")
moved toggling the static branches to the PCI init routine.
With this setup however we can't check for mio support outside the PCI
code during early boot, i.e. before switching the static branches, which
we need to be able to export this as an ELF HWCAP.
Improve on this by turning mio availability into a machine flag that
gets initially set based on CONFIG\_PCI and the facility bit and gets
toggled off if pci=nomio is found during PCI option parsing allowing
simple access to this machine flag after early init.

Fix the following out-of-bounds warnings:

The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
couple of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
memcpy(). So, the compiler legitimately complains about it. As these
are just a couple of members, fix this by copying each one of them in
separate calls to memcpy().
This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY\_SOURCE routines
on memcpy().

ipv4: ip\_output.c: Fix out-of-bounds warning in ip\_copy\_addrs()
[ Upstream commit 6321c7acb82872ef6576c520b0e178eaad3a25c0 ]
Fix the following out-of-bounds warning:
In function 'ip\_copy\_addrs',
inlined from '\_\_ip\_queue\_xmit' at net/ipv4/ip\_output.c:517:2:
net/ipv4/ip\_output.c:449:2: warning: 'memcpy' offset [40, 43] from the object at 'fl' is out of the bounds of referenced subobject 'saddr' with type 'unsigned int' at offset 36 [-Warray-bounds]
449 | memcpy(&iph->saddr, &fl4->saddr,
| ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
450 | sizeof(fl4->saddr) + sizeof(fl4->daddr));
| ~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The problem is that the original code is trying to copy data into a
couple of struct members adjacent to each other in a single call to
memcpy(). This causes a legitimate compiler warning because memcpy()
overruns the length of &iph->saddr and &fl4->saddr. As these are just
a couple of struct members, fix this by using direct assignments,
instead of memcpy().
This helps with the ongoing efforts to globally enable -Warray-bounds
and get us closer to being able to tighten the FORTIFY\_SOURCE routines
on memcpy().

net: ipa: always validate filter and route tables
[ Upstream commit 546948bf362541857d4f500705efe08a2fe0bb95 ]
All checks in ipa\_table\_validate\_build() are computed at build time,
so build that unconditionally.
In ipa\_table\_valid() calls to ipa\_table\_valid\_one() are missing the
IPA pointer parameter is missing in (a bug that shows up only when
IPA\_VALIDATE is defined). Don't bother checking whether hashed
table memory regions are valid if hashed tables are not supported.
With those things fixed, have these table validation functions built

[ Upstream commit f2c1dac0abcfa93e8b20065b8d6b4b2b6f9990aa ]
Stop supporting different sizes for hashed and non-hashed filter or
route tables. Add BUILD\_BUG\_ON() calls to verify the sizes of the
fields in the filter/route table initialization immediate command
are the same.
Add a check to ipa\_cmd\_table\_valid() to ensure the size of the
memory region being checked fits within the immediate command field
that must hold it.
Remove two Boolean parameters used only for error reporting. This
actually fixes a bug that would only show up if IPA\_VALIDATE were
defined. Define ipa\_cmd\_table\_valid() unconditionally (no longer
dependent on IPA\_VALIDATE).

drm/bridge: nwl-dsi: Avoid potential multiplication overflow on 32-bit
[ Upstream commit 47956bc86ee4e8530cac386a04f62a6095f7afbe ]
As nwl\_dsi.lanes is u32, and NSEC\_PER\_SEC is 1000000000L, the second
multiplication in
dsi->lanes \* 8 \* NSEC\_PER\_SEC
will overflow on a 32-bit platform. Fix this by making the constant
unsigned long long, forcing 64-bit arithmetic.
As iMX8 is arm64, this driver is currently used on 64-bit platforms
only, where long is 64-bit, so this cannot happen. But the issue will
start to happen when the driver is reused for a 32-bit SoC (e.g.
i.MX7ULP), or when code is copied for a new driver.

bpf/tests: Do not PASS tests without actually testing the result
[ Upstream commit 2b7e9f25e590726cca76700ebdb10e92a7a72ca1 ]
Each test case can have a set of sub-tests, where each sub-test can
run the cBPF/eBPF test snippet with its own data\_size and expected
result. Before, the end of the sub-test array was indicated by both
data\_size and result being zero. However, most or all of the internal
eBPF tests has a data\_size of zero already. When such a test also had
an expected value of zero, the test was never run but reported as
PASS anyway.
Now the test runner always runs the first sub-test, regardless of the
data\_size and result values. The sub-test array zero-termination only
applies for any additional sub-tests.
There are other ways fix it of course, but this solution at least
removes the surprise of eBPF tests with a zero result always succeeding.

To avoid this we power down hardware on boot if DIG is turned on. With
introduction of multiple eDP, hardware power down is being bypassed
under certain conditions.

ethtool: improve compat ioctl handling
[ Upstream commit dd98d2895de6485c884a9cb42de69fed02826fa4 ]
The ethtool compat ioctl handling is hidden away in net/socket.c,
which introduces a couple of minor oddities:
- The implementation may end up diverging, as seen in the RXNFC
extension in commit 84a1d9c48200 ("net: ethtool: extend RXNFC
API to support RSS spreading of filter matches") that does not work
in compat mode.
- Most architectures do not need the compat handling at all
because u64 and compat\_u64 have the same alignment.
- On x86, the conversion is done for both x32 and i386 user space,
but it's actually wrong to do it for x32 and cannot work there.
- On 32-bit Arm, it never worked for compat oabi user space, since
that needs to do the same conversion but does not.
- It would be nice to get rid of both compat\_alloc\_user\_space()
and copy\_in\_user() throughout the kernel.
None of these actually seems to be a serious problem that real
users are likely to encounter, but fixing all of them actually
leads to code that is both shorter and more readable.

is no functional change.

The virtual machine monitor (QEMU) exposes the pvpanic-pci
device to the guest. On guest side the module exists but
currently isn't loaded automatically. So the driver fails
to be probed and does not its job of handling guest panic
events.
Instead of requiring manual modprobe, let's include a device
database using the MODULE\_DEVICE\_TABLE macro and let the
module auto-load when the guest gets exposed with such a
pvpanic-pci device.

usb: gadget: composite: Allow bMaxPower=0 if self-powered
[ Upstream commit bcacbf06c891374e7fdd7b72d11cda03b0269b43 ]
Currently the composite driver encodes the MaxPower field of
the configuration descriptor by reading the c->MaxPower of the
usb\_configuration only if it is non-zero, otherwise it falls back
to using the value hard-coded in CONFIG\_USB\_GADGET\_VBUS\_DRAW.
However, there are cases when a configuration must explicitly set
bMaxPower to 0, particularly if its bmAttributes also has the
Self-Powered bit set, which is a valid combination.
This is specifically called out in the USB PD specification section
9.1, in which a PDUSB device "shall report zero in the bMaxPower
field after negotiating a mutually agreeable Contract", and also
verified by the USB Type-C Functional Test TD.4.10.2 Sink Power
Precedence Test.
The fix allows the c->MaxPower to be used for encoding the bMaxPower
even if it is 0, if the self-powered bit is also set. An example
usage of this would be for a ConfigFS gadget to be dynamically
updated by userspace when the Type-C connection is determined to be
operating in Power Delivery mode.

f\_ncm tx timeout can call us with null skb to flush

In such a case in->maxpacket will be read, even though
we've failed to check that 'in' is not NULL.
Though I've never observed this fail in practice,
however the 'flush operation' simply does not make sense with
a null usb IN endpoint - there's nowhere to flush to...
(note that we're the gadget/device, and IN is from the point
of view of the host, so here IN actually means outbound...)

drm: protect drm\_master pointers in drm\_lease.c
[ Upstream commit 56f0729a510f92151682ff6c89f69724d5595d6e ]
drm\_file->master pointers should be protected by
drm\_device.master\_mutex or drm\_file.master\_lookup\_lock when being
dereferenced.
However, in drm\_lease.c, there are multiple instances where
drm\_file->master is accessed and dereferenced while neither lock is
held. This makes drm\_lease.c vulnerable to use-after-free bugs.
We address this issue in 2 ways:
1. Add a new drm\_file\_get\_master() function that calls drm\_master\_get
on drm\_file->master while holding on to
drm\_file.master\_lookup\_lock. Since drm\_master\_get increments the
reference count of master, this prevents master from being freed until
we unreference it with drm\_master\_put.
2. In each case where drm\_file->master is directly accessed and
eventually dereferenced in drm\_lease.c, we wrap the access in a call
to the new drm\_file\_get\_master function, then unreference the master
pointer once we are done using it.

drm: serialize drm\_file.master with a new spinlock
[ Upstream commit 0b0860a3cf5eccf183760b1177a1dcdb821b0b66 ]
Currently, drm\_file.master pointers should be protected by
drm\_device.master\_mutex when being dereferenced. This is because
drm\_file.master is not invariant for the lifetime of drm\_file. If
drm\_file is not the creator of master, then drm\_file.is\_master is
false, and a call to drm\_setmaster\_ioctl will invoke
drm\_new\_set\_master, which then allocates a new master for drm\_file and
puts the old master.
Thus, without holding drm\_device.master\_mutex, the old value of
drm\_file.master could be freed while it is being used by another
concurrent process.
However, it is not always possible to lock drm\_device.master\_mutex to
dereference drm\_file.master. Through the fbdev emulation code, this
might occur in a deep nest of other locks. But drm\_device.master\_mutex
is also the outermost lock in the nesting hierarchy, so this leads to
potential deadlocks.
To address this, we introduce a new spin lock at the bottom of the
lock hierarchy that only serializes drm\_file.master. With this change,
the value of drm\_file.master changes only when both
drm\_device.master\_mutex and drm\_file.master\_lookup\_lock are
held. Hence, any process holding either of those locks can ensure that
the value of drm\_file.master will not change concurrently.
Since no lock depends on the new drm\_file.master\_lookup\_lock, when
drm\_file.master is dereferenced, but drm\_device.master\_mutex cannot be
held, we can safely protect the master pointer with
drm\_file.master\_lookup\_lock.

drm: avoid blocking in drm\_clients\_info's rcu section
[ Upstream commit 5eff9585de220cdd131237f5665db5e6c6bdf590 ]
Inside drm\_clients\_info, the rcu\_read\_lock is held to lock
pid\_task()->comm. However, within this protected section, a call to
drm\_is\_current\_master is made, which involves a mutex lock in a future
patch. However, this is illegal because the mutex lock might block
while in the RCU read-side critical section.
Since drm\_is\_current\_master isn't protected by rcu\_read\_lock, we avoid
this by moving it out of the RCU critical section.

Currently three interconnects are defined for the Qualcomm SC7280

two interconnects defined: one between the IPA and system memory;
and another between the AP and IPA config space. The bandwidths
defined for the memory and config interconnects do not match what I

SA8155p adp board has two USB A-type receptacles called
USB-portB and USB-portC respectively.
While USB-portB is a USB High-Speed connector/interface, the
USB-portC one is a USB 3.1 Super-Speed connector/interface.
Also the USB-portB is used as the USB emergency

Enable both the ports on the board in USB Host mode (since all
the USB interfaces are brought out to USB Type A

drm/ast: Disable fast reset after DRAM initial
[ Upstream commit f34bf652d680cf65783e7c57d61c94ee87f092bd ]
[Bug][AST2500]
V1:
When AST2500 acts as stand-alone VGA so that DRAM and DVO initialization
have to be achieved by VGA driver with P2A (PCI to AHB) enabling.
However, HW suggests disable Fast reset mode after DRAM initializaton,
because fast reset mode is mainly designed for ARM ICE debugger.
Once Fast reset is checked as enabling, WDT (Watch Dog Timer) should be
first enabled to avoid system deadlock before disable fast reset mode.
V2:
Use to\_pci\_dev() to get revision of PCI configuration.
V3:
If SCU00 is not unlocked, just enter its password again.
It is unnecessary to clear AHB lock condition and restore WDT default
setting again, before Fast-reset clearing.
V4:
repatch after "error : could not build fake ancestor" resolved.
V5:
Since CVE\_2019\_6260 item3, Most of AST2500 have disabled P2A(PCIe to AMBA).
However, for backward compatibility, some patches about P2A, such as items
of v5.2 and v5.3, are considered to be upstreamed with comments.
1. Add define macro to improve source readability.
ast\_drv.h, ast\_main.c, ast\_post.c
2. Add comment about "Fast restet" is enabled for ARM-ICE debugger
ast\_post.c
3. Add comment about Reset USB port to patch USB unknown device issue

iavf: fix locking of critical sections
[ Upstream commit 226d528512cfac890a1619aea4301f3dd314fe60 ]
To avoid races between iavf\_init\_task(), iavf\_reset\_task(),
iavf\_watchdog\_task(), iavf\_adminq\_task() as well as the shutdown and
remove functions more locking is required.
The current protection by \_\_IAVF\_IN\_CRITICAL\_TASK is needed in
additional places.
- The reset task performs state transitions, therefore needs locking.
- The adminq task acts on replies from the PF in
iavf\_virtchnl\_completion() which may alter the states.
- The init task is not only run during probe but also if a VF gets stuck
to reinitialize it.
- The shutdown function performs a state transition.
- The remove function performs a state transition and also free's
resources.
iavf\_lock\_timeout() is introduced to avoid waiting infinitely
and cause a deadlock. Rather unlock and print a warning.

iavf: do not override the adapter state in the watchdog task
[ Upstream commit 22c8fd71d3a5e6fe584ccc2c1e8760e5baefd5aa ]
The iavf watchdog task overrides adapter->state to \_\_IAVF\_RESETTING
when it detects a pending reset. Then schedules iavf\_reset\_task() which
takes care of the reset.
The reset task is capable of handling the reset without changing
adapter->state. In fact we lose the state information when the watchdog
task prematurely changes the adapter state. This may lead to a crash if
instead of the reset task the iavf\_remove() function gets called before
the reset task.
In that case (if we were in state \_\_IAVF\_RUNNING previously) the
iavf\_remove() function triggers iavf\_close() which fails to close the
device because of the incorrect state information.
This may result in a crash due to pending interrupts.

iio: dac: ad5624r: Fix incorrect handling of an optional regulator.
[ Upstream commit 97683c851f9cdbd3ea55697cbe2dcb6af4287bbd ]
The naming of the regulator is problematic. VCC is usually a supply
voltage whereas these devices have a separate VREF pin.
Secondly, the regulator core might have provided a stub regulator if
a real regulator wasn't provided. That would in turn have failed to
provide a voltage when queried. So reality was that there was no way
to use the internal reference.
In order to avoid breaking any dts out in the wild, make sure to fallback
to the original vcc naming if vref is not available.

tipc: keep the skb in rcv queue until the whole data is read
[ Upstream commit f4919ff59c2828064b4156e3c3600a169909bcf4 ]
Currently, when userspace reads a datagram with a buffer that is
smaller than this datagram, the data will be truncated and only
part of it can be received by users. It doesn't seem right that
users don't know the datagram size and have to use a huge buffer
to read it to avoid the truncation.
This patch to fix it by keeping the skb in rcv queue until the
whole data is read by users. Only the last msg of the datagram
will be marked with MSG\_EOR, just as TCP/SCTP does.
Note that this will work as above only when MSG\_EOR is set in the
flags parameter of recvmsg(), so that it won't break any old user
applications.

PCI: Use pci\_update\_current\_state() in pci\_enable\_device\_flags()
[ Upstream commit 14858dcc3b3587f4bb5c48e130ee7d68fc2b0a29 ]
Updating the current\_state field of struct pci\_dev the way it is done
in pci\_enable\_device\_flags() before calling do\_pci\_enable\_device() may
not work. For example, if the given PCI device depends on an ACPI
power resource whose \_STA method initially returns 0 ("off"), but the
config space of the PCI device is accessible and the power state
retrieved from the PCI\_PM\_CTRL register is D0, the current\_state
field in the struct pci\_dev representing that device will get out of
sync with the power.state of its ACPI companion object and that will
lead to power management issues going forward.
To avoid such issues, make pci\_enable\_device\_flags() call
pci\_update\_current\_state() which takes ACPI device power management
into account, if present, to retrieve the current power state of the
device.

x86/hyperv: fix for unwanted manipulation of sched\_clock when TSC marked unstable
[ Upstream commit c445535c3efbfb8cb42d098e624d46ab149664b7 ]
Marking TSC as unstable has a side effect of marking sched\_clock as
unstable when TSC is still being used as the sched\_clock. This is not
desirable. Hyper-V ultimately uses a paravirtualized clock source that
provides a stable scheduler clock even on systems without TscInvariant
CPU capability. Hence, mark\_tsc\_unstable() call should be called \_after\_
scheduler clock has been changed to the paravirtualized clocksource. This
will prevent any unwanted manipulation of the sched\_clock. Only TSC will
be correctly marked as unstable.

drm/vkms: Let shadow-plane helpers prepare the plane's FB
[ Upstream commit b43e2ec03b0de040d536591713ea9c875ff34ba9 ]
Replace vkms' prepare\_fb and cleanup\_fb functions with the generic
code for shadow-buffered planes. No functional changes.
This change also fixes a problem where IGT kms\_flip tests would
create a segmentation fault within vkms. The driver's prepare\_fb
function did not report an error if a BO's vmap operation failed.
The kernel later tried to operate on the non-mapped memory areas.
The shared shadow-plane helpers handle errors correctly, so that
the driver now avoids the segmantation fault.

libbpf: Fix reuse of pinned map on older kernel
[ Upstream commit 97eb31384af943d6b97eb5947262cee4ef25cb87 ]
When loading a BPF program with a pinned map, the loader checks whether
the pinned map can be reused, i.e. their properties match. To derive
such of the pinned map, the loader invokes BPF\_OBJ\_GET\_INFO\_BY\_FD and
then does the comparison.
Unfortunately, on < 4.12 kernels the BPF\_OBJ\_GET\_INFO\_BY\_FD is not
available, so loading the program fails with the following error:
libbpf: failed to get map info for map FD 5: Invalid argument
libbpf: couldn't reuse pinned map at
'/sys/fs/bpf/tc/globals/cilium\_call\_policy': parameter
mismatch"
libbpf: map 'cilium\_call\_policy': error reusing pinned map
libbpf: map 'cilium\_call\_policy': failed to create:
Invalid argument(-22)
libbpf: failed to load object 'bpf\_overlay.o'
To fix this, fallback to derivation of the map properties via
/proc/$PID/fdinfo/$MAP\_FD if BPF\_OBJ\_GET\_INFO\_BY\_FD fails with EINVAL,
which can be used as an indicator that the kernel doesn't support
the latter.

When starting streaming the driver currently programs the buffer
address to the CAL base-address register and assigns the buffer pointer
to ctx->dma.pending. This is not correct, as the buffer is not

[ Upstream commit bbdd3f4dbe81e19b9123bc54e23ed54517615524 ]
The DIT mode support has not been tested due to lack of platform where it

To be able to use the McASP on OMAP4/5 (only supporting DIT mode) we need
to have DIT mode working in the McASP driver on a know platform.
After hacking around (on BBW, mcasp1.axr1 can be routed out for this) it
appeared that DIT mode is broken.
This patch fixes it up and 16/24 bit audio works along with passthrough,
but I have only tested with DTS example and test files.

drm/amdgpu: Fix koops when accessing RAS EEPROM
[ Upstream commit 1d9d2ca85b32605ac9c74c8fa42d0c1cfbe019d4 ]
Debugfs RAS EEPROM files are available when
the ASIC supports RAS, and when the debugfs is
enabled, an also when "ras\_enable" module
parameter is set to 0. However in this case,
we get a kernel oops when accessing some of
the "ras\_..." controls in debugfs. The reason
for this is that struct amdgpu\_ras::adev is
unset. This commit sets it, thus enabling access
to those facilities. Note that this facilitates
EEPROM access and not necessarily RAS features or

Repeatedly running speakertest -c8 occasionally starts with

The other bit looks beneficial and apears harmless in testing so
I'd suggest adding it too.
Documentation says: HD\_CTL\_WHILSMP\_SET
Wait for whole sample. When this bit is set MAI transmit will start
only when there is at least one whole sample available in the fifo.
Documentation says: HD\_CTL\_CHALIGN\_SET
Channel Align When Overflow. This bit is used to realign the audio
channels in case of an overflow.
If this bit is set, after the detection of an overflow, equal
amount of dummy words to the missing words will be written to fifo,
filling up the broken sample and maintaining alignment.

userfaultfd: prevent concurrent API initialization
[ Upstream commit 22e5fe2a2a279d9a6fcbdfb4dffe73821bef1c90 ]
userfaultfd assumes that the enabled features are set once and never
changed after UFFDIO\_API ioctl succeeded.
However, currently, UFFDIO\_API can be called concurrently from two
different threads, succeed on both threads and leave userfaultfd's
features in non-deterministic state. Theoretically, other uffd operations
(ioctl's and page-faults) can be dispatched while adversely affected by
such changes of features.
Moreover, the writes to ctx->state and ctx->features are not ordered,
which can - theoretically, again - let userfaultfd\_ioctl() think that
userfaultfd API completed, while the features are still not initialized.
To avoid races, it is arguably best to get rid of ctx->state. Since there
are only 2 states, record the API initialization in ctx->features as the
uppermost bit and remove ctx->state.

$NM (both GNU nm and llvm-nm) warns when no symbol is found in the

Fangrui Song mentioned binutils>=2.37 `nm -q` can be used to suppress
"no symbols" [1], and llvm-nm>=13.0.0 supports -q as well.
We cannot use it for now, but note it as a TODO.

MIPS: Malta: fix alignment of the devicetree buffer

| Author: Rob Herring
| scripts/dtc: Update to upstream version v1.6.0-51-g183df9e9c2b9
The reason is the alignment test added to the fdt\_ro\_probe\_(). To fix
this issue, we need to make sure that fdt\_buf is aligned.
Since the dtc patch was designed to uncover potential issue, I handle
initial MIPS Malta patch as initial bug.

f2fs: should put a page beyond EOF when preparing a write
[ Upstream commit 9605f75cf36e0bcc0f4ada07b5be712d30107607 ]
The prepare\_compress\_overwrite() gets/locks a page to prepare a read, and calls
f2fs\_read\_multi\_pages() which checks EOF first. If there's any page beyond EOF,
we unlock the page and set cc->rpages[i] = NULL, which we can't put the page
anymore. This makes page leak, so let's fix by putting that page.

f2fs: fix unexpected ENOENT comes from f2fs\_map\_blocks()
[ Upstream commit adf9ea89c719c1d23794e363f631e376b3ff8cbc ]
In below path, it will return ENOENT if filesystem is shutdown:
- f2fs\_map\_blocks
- f2fs\_get\_dnode\_of\_data
- f2fs\_get\_node\_page
- \_\_get\_node\_page
- read\_node\_page
- is\_sbi\_flag\_set(sbi, SBI\_IS\_SHUTDOWN)
return -ENOENT
- force return value from ENOENT to 0
It should be fine for read case, since it indicates a hole condition,
and caller could use .m\_next\_pgofs to skip the hole and continue the
lookup.
However it may cause confusing for write case, since leaving a hole
there, and said nothing was wrong doesn't help.
There is at least one case from dax\_iomap\_actor() will complain that,
so fix this in prior to supporting dax in f2fs.

KVM: PPC: Fix clearing never mapped TCEs in realmode
[ Upstream commit 1d78dfde33a02da1d816279c2e3452978b7abd39 ]
Since commit e1a1ef84cd07 ("KVM: PPC: Book3S: Allocate guest TCEs on
demand too"), pages for TCE tables for KVM guests are allocated only
when needed. This allows skipping any update when clearing TCEs. This
works mostly fine as TCE updates are handled when the MMU is enabled.
The realmode handlers fail with H\_TOO\_HARD when pages are not yet
allocated, except when clearing a TCE in which case KVM prints a warning
and proceeds to dereference a NULL pointer, which crashes the host OS.
This has not been caught so far as the change in commit e1a1ef84cd07 is
reasonably new, and POWER9 runs mostly radix which does not use realmode
handlers. With hash, the default TCE table is memset() by QEMU when the
machine is reset which triggers page faults and the KVM TCE device's
kvm\_spapr\_tce\_fault() handles those with MMU on. And the huge DMA
windows are not cleared by VMs which instead successfully create a DMA
window big enough to map the VM memory 1:1 and then VMs just map
everything without clearing.
This started crashing now as commit 381ceda88c4c ("powerpc/pseries/iommu:
Make use of DDW for indirect mapping") added a mode when a dymanic DMA
window not big enough to map the VM memory 1:1 but it is used anyway,
and the VM now is the first (i.e. not QEMU) to clear a just created
table. Note that upstream QEMU needs to be modified to trigger the VM to
trigger the host OS crash.
This replaces WARN\_ON\_ONCE\_RM() with a check and return, and adds
another warning if TCE is not being cleared.

'clk\_init\_data' for gates is setting up 'CLK\_IS\_CRITICAL'

drivers of this SoC might not be ready to use the clock
and we don't wanted the kernel to disable them since default
behaviour without clock driver was to set all gate bits to
enabled state. After a bit more testing and checking driver
code it is safe to remove this flag and just let the kernel
to disable those gates that are not in use. No regressions
seems to appear.

fscache: Fix cookie key hashing
[ Upstream commit 35b72573e977ed6b18b094136a4fa3e0ffb13603 ]
The current hash algorithm used for hashing cookie keys is really bad,
producing almost no dispersion (after a test kernel build, ~30000 files
were split over just 18 out of the 32768 hash buckets).
Borrow the full\_name\_hash() hash function into fscache to do the hashing
for cookie keys and, in the future, volume keys.
I don't want to use full\_name\_hash() as-is because I want the hash value to
be consistent across arches and over time as the hash value produced may
get used on disk.
I can also optimise parts of it away as the key will always be a padded
array of aligned 32-bit words.

powerpc/smp: Update cpu\_core\_map on all PowerPc systems
[ Upstream commit b8b928030332a0ca16d42433eb2c3085600d8704 ]
lscpu() uses core\_siblings to list the number of sockets in the
system. core\_siblings is set using topology\_core\_cpumask.
While optimizing the powerpc bootup path, Commit 4ca234a9cbd7
("powerpc/smp: Stop updating cpu\_core\_mask"). it was found that
updating cpu\_core\_mask() ended up taking a lot of time. It was thought
that on Powerpc, cpu\_core\_mask() would always be same as
cpu\_cpu\_mask() i.e number of sockets will always be equal to number of
nodes. As an optimization, cpu\_core\_mask() was made a snapshot of
cpu\_cpu\_mask().
However that was found to be false with PowerPc KVM guests, where each
node could have more than one socket. So with Commit c47f892d7aa6
("powerpc/smp: Reintroduce cpu\_core\_mask"), cpu\_core\_mask was updated
based on chip\_id but in an optimized way using some mask manipulations
and chip\_id caching.
However on non-PowerNV and non-pseries KVM guests (i.e not
implementing cpu\_to\_chip\_id(), continued to use a copy of
cpu\_cpu\_mask().
There are two issues that were noticed on such systems
1. lscpu would report one extra socket.
On a IBM,9009-42A (aka zz system) which has only 2 chips/ sockets/
nodes, lscpu would report
Architecture: ppc64le
Byte Order: Little Endian
CPU(s): 160
On-line CPU(s) list: 0-159
Thread(s) per core: 8
Core(s) per socket: 6
Socket(s): 3 <--------------
NUMA node(s): 2
Model: 2.2 (pvr 004e 0202)
Model name: POWER9 (architected), altivec supported
Hypervisor vendor: pHyp
Virtualization type: para
L1d cache: 32K
L1i cache: 32K
L2 cache: 512K
L3 cache: 10240K
NUMA node0 CPU(s): 0-79
NUMA node1 CPU(s): 80-159
2. Currently cpu\_cpu\_mask is updated when a core is
added/removed. However its not updated when smt mode switching or on
CPUs are explicitly offlined. However all other percpu masks are
updated to ensure only active/online CPUs are in the masks.
This results in build\_sched\_domain traces since there will be CPUs in
cpu\_cpu\_mask() but those CPUs are not present in SMT / CACHE / MC /
NUMA domains. A loop of threads running smt mode switching and core
add/remove will soon show this trace.
Hence cpu\_cpu\_mask has to be update at smt mode switch.
This will have impact on cpu\_core\_mask(). cpu\_core\_mask() is a
snapshot of cpu\_cpu\_mask. Different CPUs within the same socket will
end up having different cpu\_core\_masks since they are snapshots at
different points of time. This means when lscpu will start reporting
many more sockets than the actual number of sockets/ nodes / chips.
Different ways to handle this problem:
A. Update the snapshot aka cpu\_core\_mask for all CPUs whenever
cpu\_cpu\_mask is updated. This would a non-optimal solution.
B. Instead of a cpumask\_var\_t, make cpu\_core\_map a cpumask pointer
pointing to cpu\_cpu\_mask. However percpu cpumask pointer is frowned
upon and we need a clean way to handle PowerPc KVM guest which is
not a snapshot.
C. Update cpu\_core\_masks all PowerPc systems like in PowerPc KVM
guests using mask manipulations. This approach is relatively simple
and unifies with the existing code.
D. On top of 3, we could also resurrect get\_physical\_package\_id which
could return a nid for the said CPU. However this is not needed at this
time.
Option C is the preferred approach for now.
While this is somewhat a revert of Commit 4ca234a9cbd7 ("powerpc/smp:
Stop updating cpu\_core\_mask").
1. Plain revert has some conflicts
2. For chip\_id == -1, the cpu\_core\_mask is made identical to
cpu\_cpu\_mask, unlike previously where cpu\_core\_mask was set to a core
if chip\_id doesn't exist.
This goes by the principle that if chip\_id is not exposed, then
sockets / chip / node share the same set of CPUs.
With the fix, lscpu o/p would be

RDMA/hns: Bugfix for incorrect association between dip\_idx and dgid
[ Upstream commit eb653eda1e91dd3e7d1d2448d528d033dbfbe78f ]
dip\_idx and dgid should be a one-to-one mapping relationship, but when
qp\_num loops back to the start number, it may happen that two different
dgid are assiociated to the same dip\_idx incorrectly.
One solution is to store the qp\_num that is not assigned to dip\_idx in an
array. When a dip\_idx needs to be allocated to a new dgid, an spare qp\_num
is extracted and assigned to dip\_idx.

powerpc/perf: Fix the check for SIAR value
[ Upstream commit 3c69a5f22223fa3e312689ec218b5059784d49d7 ]
Incase of random sampling, there can be scenarios where
Sample Instruction Address Register(SIAR) may not latch
to the sampled instruction and could result in
the value of 0. In these scenarios it is preferred to
return regs->nip. These corner cases are seen in the
previous generation (p9) also.
Patch adds the check for SIAR value along with regs\_use\_siar
and siar\_valid checks so that the function will return
regs->nip incase SIAR is zero.
Patch drops the code under PPMU\_P10\_DD1 flag check
which handles SIAR 0 case only for Power10 DD1.

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV Nested: Reflect guest PMU in-use to L0 when guest SPRs are live
[ Upstream commit 1782663897945a5cf28e564ba5eed730098e9aa4 ]
After the L1 saves its PMU SPRs but before loading the L2's PMU SPRs,
switch the pmcregs\_in\_use field in the L1 lppaca to the value advertised
by the L2 in its VPA. On the way out of the L2, set it back after saving
the L2 PMU registers (if they were in-use).
This transfers the PMU liveness indication between the L1 and L2 at the
points where the registers are not live.
This fixes the nested HV bug for which a workaround was added to the L0
HV by commit 63279eeb7f93a ("KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Always save guest pmu
for guest capable of nesting"), which explains the problem in detail.
That workaround is no longer required for guests that include this bug

KVM: PPC: Book3S HV: Fix copy\_tofrom\_guest routines
[ Upstream commit 5d7d6dac8fe99ed59eee2300e4a03370f94d5222 ]
The \_\_kvmhv\_copy\_tofrom\_guest\_radix function was introduced along with
nested HV guest support. It uses the platform's Radix MMU quadrants to
provide a nested hypervisor with fast access to its nested guests
memory (H\_COPY\_TOFROM\_GUEST hypercall). It has also since been added
as a fast path for the kvmppc\_ld/st routines which are used during
instruction emulation.
The commit def0bfdbd603 ("powerpc: use probe\_user\_read() and
probe\_user\_write()") changed the low level copy function from
raw\_copy\_from\_user to probe\_user\_read, which adds a check to
access\_ok. In powerpc that is:
static inline bool \_\_access\_ok(unsigned long addr, unsigned long size)
{
return addr < TASK\_SIZE\_MAX && size <= TASK\_SIZE\_MAX - addr;
}
and TASK\_SIZE\_MAX is 0x0010000000000000UL for 64-bit, which means that
setting the two MSBs of the effective address (which correspond to the
quadrant) now cause access\_ok to reject the access.
This was not caught earlier because the most common code path via
kvmppc\_ld/st contains a fallback (kvm\_read\_guest) that is likely to
succeed for L1 guests. For nested guests there is no fallback.
Another issue is that probe\_user\_read (now \_\_copy\_from\_user\_nofault)
does not return the number of bytes not copied in case of failure, so
the destination memory is not being cleared anymore in
kvmhv\_copy\_from\_guest\_radix:
ret = kvmhv\_copy\_tofrom\_guest\_radix(vcpu, eaddr, to, NULL, n);
if (ret > 0) <-- always false!
memset(to + (n - ret), 0, ret);
This patch fixes both issues by skipping access\_ok and open-coding the
low level \_\_copy\_to/from\_user\_inatomic.

clk: imx8m: fix clock tree update of TF-A managed clocks
[ Upstream commit d36207b848a6490e14664e2197a1c8ab51d8148e ]
On the i.MX8M\*, the TF-A exposes a SiP (Silicon Provider) service
for DDR frequency scaling. The imx8m-ddrc-devfreq driver calls the
SiP and then does clk\_set\_parent on the DDR muxes to synchronize
the clock tree.
Since 936c383673b9 ("clk: imx: fix composite peripheral flags"),
these TF-A managed muxes have SET\_PARENT\_GATE set, which results
in imx8m-ddrc-devfreq's clk\_set\_parent after SiP failing with -EBUSY:
echo 25000000 > userspace/set\_freq
imx8m-ddrc-devfreq 3d400000.memory-controller: failed to set
dram\_apb parent: -16
Fix this by adding a new i.MX composite flag for firmware managed
clocks, which clears SET\_PARENT\_GATE.
This is safe to do, because updating the Linux clock tree to reflect
reality will always be glitch-free.

This driver has some left over "return 1" on failure style code mixed with

should just convert everything to return negative error codes.
Then there was a problem that there were two variables used to store error
codes which just resulted in confusion. If qedf\_alloc\_bdq() returned a
negative error code, we accidentally returned success instead of
propagating the error code. So get rid of the "rc" variable and use
"status" every where.
Also remove the "status = 0" initialization so that these sorts of bugs

[ Upstream commit d36d4a1d75d2a8bd14ec00d5cb0ce166f6886146 ]
When numa is used to map CPU to PCI device, the optimized path to read
from cached data is not working and still calls \_isst\_if\_get\_pci\_dev().
The reason is that when caching the mapping, numa information is not
available as it is read later. So move the assignment of
isst\_cpu\_info[cpu].numa\_node before calling \_isst\_if\_get\_pci\_dev().

powerpc/numa: Consider the max NUMA node for migratable LPAR
[ Upstream commit 9c7248bb8de31f51c693bfa6a6ea53b1c07e0fa8 ]
When a LPAR is migratable, we should consider the maximum possible NUMA
node instead of the number of NUMA nodes from the actual system.
The DT property 'ibm,current-associativity-domains' defines the maximum
number of nodes the LPAR can see when running on that box. But if the
LPAR is being migrated on another box, it may see up to the nodes
defined by 'ibm,max-associativity-domains'. So if a LPAR is migratable,
that value should be used.
Unfortunately, there is no easy way to know if an LPAR is migratable or
not. The hypervisor exports the property 'ibm,migratable-partition' in
the case it set to migrate partition, but that would not mean that the
current partition is migratable.
Without this patch, when a LPAR is started on a 2 node box and then
migrated to a 3 node box, the hypervisor may spread the LPAR's CPUs on
the 3rd node. In that case if a CPU from that 3rd node is added to the
LPAR, it will be wrongly assigned to the node because the kernel has
been set to use up to 2 nodes (the configuration of the departure node).
With this patch applies, the CPU is correctly added to the 3rd node.

scsi: ufshcd: Fix device links when BOOT WLUN fails to probe
[ Upstream commit bf25967ac54129ffb676ee0dbe3b8b34af6c6232 ]
Managed device links are deleted by device\_del(). However it is possible to
add a device link to a consumer before device\_add(), and then discovering
an error prevents the device from being used. In that case normally
references to the device would be dropped and the device would be deleted.
However the device link holds a reference to the device, so the device link
and device remain indefinitely (unless the supplier is deleted).
For UFSHCD, if a LUN fails to probe (e.g. absent BOOT WLUN), the device
will not have been registered but can still have a device link holding a
reference to the device. The unwanted device link will prevent runtime
suspend indefinitely.
Amend device link removal to accept removal of a link with an unregistered
consumer device (suggested by Rafael), and fix UFSHCD by explicitly
deleting the device link when SCSI destroys the SCSI device.

The xprtrdma client code currently relies on the task that initiated the

attempt. If the task is woken early, due to some other event, then that
lock could get released early.
Avoid races by using the same mechanism that the socket code uses of
transferring lock ownership to the RDMA connect worker itself. That
frees us to call rpcrdma\_xprt\_disconnect() directly since we're now
guaranteed exclusion w.r.t. other callers.

Decouple dma\_debug\_fs\_init from dma\_debug\_init and defer its init until
core\_initcall\_sync (after debugfs has been initialized) while letting
dma-debug initialization occur as soon as possible to catch any early

f2fs: reduce the scope of setting fsck tag when de->name\_len is zero
[ Upstream commit d4bf15a7ce172d186d400d606adf4f34a59130d6 ]
I recently found a case where de->name\_len is 0 in f2fs\_fill\_dentries()
easily reproduced, and finally set the fsck flag.
Thread A Thread B
- f2fs\_readdir
- f2fs\_read\_inline\_dir
- ctx->pos = d.max
- f2fs\_add\_dentry
- f2fs\_add\_inline\_entry
- do\_convert\_inline\_dir
- f2fs\_add\_regular\_entry
- f2fs\_readdir
- f2fs\_fill\_dentries
- set\_sbi\_flag(sbi, SBI\_NEED\_FSCK)
Process A opens the folder, and has been reading without closing it.
During this period, Process B created a file under the folder (occupying
multiple f2fs\_dir\_entry, exceeding the d.max of the inline dir). After
creation, process A uses the d.max of inline dir to read it again, and
it will read that de->name\_len is 0.
And Chao pointed out that w/o inline conversion, the race condition still
can happen as below:
dir\_entry1: A
dir\_entry2: B
dir\_entry3: C
free slot: \_
ctx->pos: ^
Thread A is traversing directory,
ctx-pos moves to below position after readdir() by thread A:
AAAABBBB\_\_\_
^
Then thread B delete dir\_entry2, and create dir\_entry3.
Thread A calls readdir() to lookup dirents starting from middle
of new dirent slots as below:
AAAACCCCCC\_
^
In these scenarios, the file system is not damaged, and it's hard to
avoid it. But we can bypass tagging FSCK flag if:
a) bit\_pos (:= ctx->pos % d->max) is non-zero and
b) before bit\_pos moves to first valid dir\_entry.

After commit 7cbd631d4dec ("cpuidle: pseries: Fixup CEDE0 latency only

The function pseries\_idle\_probe() references
the function \_\_init fixup\_cede0\_latency().
This is often because pseries\_idle\_probe lacks a \_\_init

pseries\_idle\_probe() is a non-init function, which calls
fixup\_cede0\_latency(), which is an init function, explaining the

cpuidle: pseries: Fixup CEDE0 latency only for POWER10 onwards
[ Upstream commit 50741b70b0cbbafbd9199f5180e66c0c53783a4a ]
Commit d947fb4c965c ("cpuidle: pseries: Fixup exit latency for
CEDE(0)") sets the exit latency of CEDE(0) based on the latency values
of the Extended CEDE states advertised by the platform
On POWER9 LPARs, the firmwares advertise a very low value of 2us for
CEDE1 exit latency on a Dedicated LPAR. The latency advertized by the
PHYP hypervisor corresponds to the latency required to wakeup from the
underlying hardware idle state. However the wakeup latency from the
LPAR perspective should include
1. The time taken to transition the CPU from the Hypervisor into the
LPAR post wakeup from platform idle state
2. Time taken to send the IPI from the source CPU (waker) to the idle
target CPU (wakee).
1. can be measured via timer idle test, where we queue a timer, say
for 1ms, and enter the CEDE state. When the timer fires, in the timer
handler we compute how much extra timer over the expected 1ms have we
consumed. On a a POWER9 LPAR the numbers are
CEDE latency measured using a timer (numbers in ns)
N Min Median Avg 90%ile 99%ile Max Stddev
400 2601 5677 5668.74 5917 6413 9299 455.01
1. and 2. combined can be determined by an IPI latency test where we
send an IPI to an idle CPU and in the handler compute the time
difference between when the IPI was sent and when the handler ran. We
see the following numbers on POWER9 LPAR.
CEDE latency measured using an IPI (numbers in ns)
N Min Median Avg 90%ile 99%ile Max Stddev
400 711 7564 7369.43 8559 9514 9698 1200.01
Suppose, we consider the 99th percentile latency value measured using
the IPI to be the wakeup latency, the value would be 9.5us This is in
the ballpark of the default value of 10us.
Hence, use the exit latency of CEDE(0) based on the latency values
advertized by platform only from POWER10 onwards. The values
advertized on POWER10 platforms is more realistic and informed by the
latency measurements. For earlier platforms stick to the default value
of 10us. The fix was suggested by Michael Ellerman.

scsi: ufs: Fix the SCSI abort handler
[ Upstream commit 64180742605f772d511903c9e50262afb13726c6 ]
Make the following changes in ufshcd\_abort():
- Return FAILED instead of SUCCESS if the abort handler notices that a
SCSI command has already been completed. Returning SUCCESS in this case
triggers a use-after-free and may trigger a kernel crash.
- Fix the code for aborting SCSI commands submitted to a WLUN.
The current approach for aborting SCSI commands that have been submitted to
a WLUN and that timed out is as follows:
- Report to the SCSI core that the command has completed successfully.
Let the block layer free any data buffers associated with the command.
- Mark the command as outstanding in 'outstanding\_reqs'.
- If the block layer tries to reuse the tag associated with the aborted
command, busy-wait until the tag is freed.
This approach can result in:
- Memory corruption if the controller accesses the data buffer after the
block layer has freed the associated data buffers.
- A race condition if ufshcd\_queuecommand() or ufshcd\_exec\_dev\_cmd()
checks the bit that corresponds to an aborted command in
'outstanding\_reqs' after it has been cleared and before it is reset.
- High energy consumption if ufshcd\_queuecommand() repeatedly returns
SCSI\_MLQUEUE\_HOST\_BUSY.
Fix this by reporting to the SCSI error handler that aborting a SCSI
command failed if the SCSI command was submitted to a WLUN.

IB/hfi1: Adjust pkey entry in index 0
[ Upstream commit 62004871e1fa7f9a60797595c03477af5b5ec36f ]
It is possible for the primary IPoIB network device associated with any
RDMA device to fail to join certain multicast groups preventing IPv6
neighbor discovery and possibly other network ULPs from working
correctly. The IPv4 broadcast group is not affected as the IPoIB network
device handles joining that multicast group directly.
This is because the primary IPoIB network device uses the pkey at ndex 0
in the associated RDMA device's pkey table. Anytime the pkey value of
index 0 changes, the primary IPoIB network device automatically modifies
it's broadcast address (i.e. /sys/class/net/[ib0]/broadcast), since the
broadcast address includes the pkey value, and then bounces carrier. This
includes initial pkey assignment, such as when the pkey at index 0
transitions from the opa default of invalid (0x0000) to some value such as
the OPA default pkey for Virtual Fabric 0: 0x8001 or when the fabric
manager is restarted with a configuration change causing the pkey at index
0 to change. Many network ULPs are not sensitive to the carrier bounce and
are not expecting the broadcast address to change including the linux IPv6
stack. This problem does not affect IPoIB child network devices as their
pkey value is constant for all time.
To mitigate this issue, change the default pkey in at index 0 to 0x8001 to
cover the predominant case and avoid issues as ipoib comes up and the FM
sweeps.
At some point, ipoib multicast support should automatically fix
non-broadcast addresses as it does with the primary broadcast address.

clk: rockchip: drop GRF dependency for rk3328/rk3036 pll types
[ Upstream commit 6fffe52fb336ec2063270a7305652a93ea677ca1 ]
The rk3036/rk3328 pll types were converted to checking the lock status
via the internal register in january 2020, so don't need the grf
reference since then.
But it was forgotten to remove grf check when deciding between the
pll rate ops (read-only vs. read-write), so a clock driver without
the needed grf reference might've been put into the read-only mode
just because the grf reference was missing.
This affected the rk356x that needs to reclock certain plls at boot.
Fix this by removing the check for the grf for selecting the utilized
operations.

pinctrl: armada-37xx: Correct PWM pins definitions
[ Upstream commit baf8d6899b1e8906dc076ef26cc633e96a8bb0c3 ]
The PWM pins on North Bridge on Armada 37xx can be configured into PWM
or GPIO functions. When in PWM function, each pin can also be configured
to drive low on 0 and tri-state on 1 (LED mode).
The current definitions handle this by declaring two pin groups for each
pin:
- group "pwmN" with functions "pwm" and "gpio"
- group "ledN\_od" ("od" for open drain) with functions "led" and "gpio"
This is semantically incorrect. The correct definition for each pin
should be one group with three functions: "pwm", "led" and "gpio".
Change the "pwmN" groups to support "led" function.
Remove "ledN\_od" groups. This cannot break backwards compatibility with
older device trees: no device tree uses it since there is no PWM driver
for this SOC yet. Also "ledN\_od" groups are not even documented.

even if current capacity is at 100% when battery strength reporting
is done via HID interface. In fact, we were doing just that before

RDMA/rtrs: Enable the same selective signal for heartbeat and IO
[ Upstream commit e2d98504c697f9c8e45b815062f8893b10808d8e ]
On idle session, because we do not do signal for heartbeat, it will
overflow the send queue after sometime.
To avoid that, we need to enable the signal for heartbeat. To do that, add
a new member signal\_interval in rtrs\_path, which will set min of
queue\_depth and SERVICE\_CON\_QUEUE\_DEPTH, and track it for both heartbeat
and IO, so the sq queue full accounting is correct.

PCI: aardvark: Increase polling delay to 1.5s while waiting for PIO response
commit 02bcec3ea5591720114f586960490b04b093a09e upstream.
Measurements in different conditions showed that aardvark hardware PIO
response can take up to 1.44s. Increase wait timeout from 1ms to 1.5s to
ensure that we do not miss responses from hardware. After 1.44s hardware
returns errors (e.g. Completer abort).
The previous two patches fixed checking for PIO status, so now we can use
it to also catch errors which are reported by hardware after 1.44s.
After applying this patch, kernel can detect and print PIO errors to dmesg:

PCI: aardvark: Fix checking for PIO status
commit fcb461e2bc8b83b7eaca20cb2221e8b940f2189c upstream.
There is an issue that when PCIe switch is connected to an Armada 3700
board, there will be lots of warnings about PIO errors when reading the
config space. According to Aardvark PIO read and write sequence in HW
specification, the current way to check PIO status has the following
issues:
1) For PIO read operation, it reports the error message, which should be
avoided according to HW specification.
2) For PIO read and write operations, it only checks PIO operation complete
status, which is not enough, and error status should also be checked.
This patch aligns the code with Aardvark PIO read and write sequence in HW
specification on PIO status check and fix the warnings when reading config
space.

PCI: aardvark: Configure PCIe resources from 'ranges' DT property
commit 64f160e19e9264a7f6d89c516baae1473b6f8359 upstream.
In commit 6df6ba974a55 ("PCI: aardvark: Remove PCIe outbound window
configuration") was removed aardvark PCIe outbound window configuration and
commit description said that was recommended solution by HW designers.
But that commit completely removed support for configuring PCIe IO
resources without removing PCIe IO 'ranges' from DTS files. After that
commit PCIe IO space started to be treated as PCIe MEM space and accessing
it just caused kernel crash.
Moreover implementation of PCIe outbound windows prior that commit was
incorrect. It completely ignored offset between CPU address and PCIe bus
address and expected that in DTS is CPU address always same as PCIe bus
address without doing any checks. Also it completely ignored size of every
PCIe resource specified in 'ranges' DTS property and expected that every
PCIe resource has size 128 MB (also for PCIe IO range). Again without any
check. Apparently none of PCIe resource has in DTS specified size of 128
MB. So it was completely broken and thanks to how aardvark mask works,
configuration was completely ignored.
This patch reverts back support for PCIe outbound window configuration but
implementation is a new without issues mentioned above. PCIe outbound
window is required when DTS specify in 'ranges' property non-zero offset
between CPU and PCIe address space. To address recommendation by HW
designers as specified in commit description of 6df6ba974a55, set default
outbound parameters as PCIe MEM access without translation and therefore
for this PCIe 'ranges' it is not needed to configure PCIe outbound window.
For PCIe IO space is needed to configure aardvark PCIe outbound window.
This patch fixes kernel crash when trying to access PCIe IO space.

PCI: Return ~0 data on pciconfig\_read() CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN failure
commit a8bd29bd49c4156ea0ec5a97812333e2aeef44e7 upstream.
The pciconfig\_read() syscall reads PCI configuration space using
hardware-dependent config accessors.
If the read fails on PCI, most accessors don't return an error; they
pretend the read was successful and got ~0 data from the device, so the
syscall returns success with ~0 data in the buffer.
When the accessor does return an error, pciconfig\_read() normally fills the
user's buffer with ~0 and returns an error in errno. But after
e4585da22ad0 ("pci syscall.c: Switch to refcounting API"), we don't fill
the buffer with ~0 for the EPERM "user lacks CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN" error.
Userspace may rely on the ~0 data to detect errors, but after e4585da22ad0,
that would not detect CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN errors.
Restore the original behaviour of filling the buffer with ~0 when the
CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN check fails.

PCI: Restrict ASMedia ASM1062 SATA Max Payload Size Supported
commit b12d93e9958e028856cbcb061b6e64728ca07755 upstream.
The ASMedia ASM1062 SATA controller advertises Max\_Payload\_Size\_Supported
of 512, but in fact it cannot handle incoming TLPs with payload size of
512.
We discovered this issue on PCIe controllers capable of MPS = 512 (Aardvark
and DesignWare), where the issue presents itself as an External Abort.
Bjorn Helgaas says:
Probably ASM1062 reports a Malformed TLP error when it receives a data
payload of 512 bytes, and Aardvark, DesignWare, etc convert this to an
arm64 External Abort. [1]
To avoid this problem, limit the ASM1062 Max Payload Size Supported to 256
bytes, so we set the Max Payload Size of devices that may send TLPs to the
ASM1062 to 256 or less.

PCI/portdrv: Enable Bandwidth Notification only if port supports it
commit 00823dcbdd415c868390feaca16f0265101efab4 upstream.
Previously we assumed that all Root Ports and Switch Downstream Ports
supported Link Bandwidth Notification. Per spec, this is only required
for Ports supporting Links wider than x1 and/or multiple Link speeds
(PCIe r5.0, sec 7.5.3.6).
Because we assumed all Ports supported it, we tried to set up a Bandwidth
Notification IRQ, which failed for devices that don't support IRQs at all,
which meant pcieport didn't attach to the Port at all.
Check the Link Bandwidth Notification Capability bit and enable the service
only when the Port supports it.

sched: Prevent balance\_push() on remote runqueues
commit 868ad33bfa3bf39960982682ad3a0f8ebda1656e upstream.
sched\_setscheduler() and rt\_mutex\_setprio() invoke the run-queue balance
callback after changing priorities or the scheduling class of a task. The
run-queue for which the callback is invoked can be local or remote.
That's not a problem for the regular rq::push\_work which is serialized with
a busy flag in the run-queue struct, but for the balance\_push() work which
is only valid to be invoked on the outgoing CPU that's wrong. It not only
triggers the debug warning, but also leaves the per CPU variable push\_work
unprotected, which can result in double enqueues on the stop machine list.
Remove the warning and validate that the function is invoked on the
outgoing CPU.

commit b30d0289de72c62516df03fdad8d53f552c69839 upstream.
The merge\_fdt\_bootargs() function by definition consumes more than 1024
bytes of stack because it has a 1024 byte command line on the stack,
meaning that we always get a warning when building this file:

arch/arm/boot/compressed/atags\_to\_fdt.c:98:1: warning: the frame size of 1032 bytes is larger than 1024 bytes [-Wframe-larger-than=]
However, as this is the decompressor and we know that it has a very shallow
call chain, and we do not actually risk overflowing the kernel stack
at runtime here.
This just shuts up the warning by disabling the warning flag for this
file.

covering all Samsung 800 series SSDs, to only apply to "Samsung SSD 840\*"
and "Samsung SSD 850\*" series based on information from Samsung.
But there is a large number of users which is still reporting issues
with the Samsung 860 and 870 SSDs combined with Intel, ASmedia or
Marvell SATA controllers and all reporters also report these problems
going away when disabling queued trims.
Note that with AMD SATA controllers users are reporting even worse
issues and only completely disabling NCQ helps there, this will be
addressed in a separate patch.

s390/qdio: cancel the ESTABLISH ccw after timeout
commit 1c1dc8bda3a05c60877a6649775894db5343bdea upstream.
When the ESTABLISH ccw does not complete within the specified timeout,
try our best to cancel the ccw program that is still active on the
device. Otherwise the IO subsystem might be accessing it even after
the driver eg. called qdio\_free().

s390/qdio: fix roll-back after timeout on ESTABLISH ccw
commit 2c197870e4701610ec3b1143808d4e31152caf30 upstream.
When qdio\_establish() times out while waiting for the ESTABLISH ccw to
complete, it calls qdio\_shutdown() to roll back all of its previous
actions. But at this point the qdio\_irq's state is still
QDIO\_IRQ\_STATE\_INACTIVE, so qdio\_shutdown() will exit immediately
without doing any actual work.
Which means that eg. the qdio\_irq's thinint-indicator stays registered,
and cdev->handler isn't restored to its old value. And since
commit 954d6235be41 ("s390/qdio: make thinint registration symmetric")
the qdio\_irq also stays on the tiq\_list, so on the next qdio\_establish()
we might get a helpful BUG from the list-debugging code:
...

Fix this by extracting a goto-chain from the existing error exits in
qdio\_establish(), and check the return value of the wait\_event\_...()

dm crypt: Avoid percpu\_counter spinlock contention in crypt\_page\_alloc()
commit 528b16bfc3ae5f11638e71b3b63a81f9999df727 upstream.
On systems with many cores using dm-crypt, heavy spinlock contention in
percpu\_counter\_compare() can be observed when the page allocation limit
for a given device is reached or close to be reached. This is due
to percpu\_counter\_compare() taking a spinlock to compute an exact
result on potentially many CPUs at the same time.
Switch to non-exact comparison of allocated and allowed pages by using
the value returned by percpu\_counter\_read\_positive() to avoid taking
the percpu\_counter spinlock.
This may over/under estimate the actual number of allocated pages by at
most (batch-1) \* num\_online\_cpus().
Currently, batch is bounded by 32. The system on which this issue was
first observed has 256 CPUs and 512GB of RAM. With a 4k page size, this
change may over/under estimate by 31MB. With ~10G (2%) allowed dm-crypt
allocations, this seems an acceptable error. Certainly preferred over
running into the spinlock contention.
This behavior was reproduced on an EC2 c5.24xlarge instance with 96 CPUs
and 192GB RAM as follows, but can be provoked on systems with less CPUs
as well.
\* Disable swap
\* Tune vm settings to promote regular writeback
$ echo 50 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty\_expire\_centisecs
$ echo 25 > /proc/sys/vm/dirty\_writeback\_centisecs
$ echo $((128 \* 1024 \* 1024)) > /proc/sys/vm/dirty\_background\_bytes
\* Create 8 dmcrypt devices based on files on a tmpfs
\* Create and mount an ext4 filesystem on each crypt devices
\* Run stress-ng --hdd 8 within one of above filesystems
Total %system usage collected from sysstat goes to ~35%. Write throughput
on the underlying loop device is ~2GB/s. perf profiling an individual
kworker kcryptd thread shows the following profile, indicating spinlock
contention in percpu\_counter\_compare():

Then the kernel reports:

There is no reason to assume that the IRQ rising edge (indicating that
the device start up phase is done) will happen after we request the IRQ.
If the device is already up by the time we request it, the call to
'wait\_for\_completion\_timeout()' will timeout and we will fail the device
probe even though there's nothing wrong.
Fix it by just polling the status register until we get the indication that
the device is up and running. As a side effect of this fix, requesting the
IRQ is also moved to after the setup function.

arm64: head: avoid over-mapping in map\_memory
commit 90268574a3e8a6b883bd802d702a2738577e1006 upstream.
The `compute\_indices` and `populate\_entries` macros operate on inclusive
bounds, and thus the `map\_memory` macro which uses them also operates
on inclusive bounds.
We pass `\_end` and `\_idmap\_text\_end` to `map\_memory`, but these are
exclusive bounds, and if one of these is sufficiently aligned (as a
result of kernel configuration, physical placement, and KASLR), then:
\* In `compute\_indices`, the computed `iend` will be in the page/block \*after\*
the final byte of the intended mapping.
\* In `populate\_entries`, an unnecessary entry will be created at the end
of each level of table. At the leaf level, this entry will map up to
SWAPPER\_BLOCK\_SIZE bytes of physical addresses that we did not intend
to map.
As we may map up to SWAPPER\_BLOCK\_SIZE bytes more than intended, we may
violate the boot protocol and map physical address past the 2MiB-aligned
end address we are permitted to map. As we map these with Normal memory
attributes, this may result in further problems depending on what these
physical addresses correspond to.
The final entry at each level may require an additional table at that
level. As EARLY\_ENTRIES() calculates an inclusive bound, we allocate
enough memory for this.
Avoid the extraneous mapping by having map\_memory convert the exclusive
end address to an inclusive end address by subtracting one, and do
likewise in EARLY\_ENTRIES() when calculating the number of required
tables. For clarity, comments are updated to more clearly document which
boundaries the macros operate on. For consistency with the other
macros, the comments in map\_memory are also updated to describe `vstart`
and `vend` as virtual addresses.

When switching to an 'mm\_struct' for the first time following an ASID
rollover, a new ASID may be allocated and assigned to 'mm->context.id'.
This reassignment can happen concurrently with other operations on the
mm, such as unmapping pages and subsequently issuing TLB invalidation.
Consequently, we need to ensure that (a) accesses to 'mm->context.id'
are atomic and (b) all page-table updates made prior to a TLBI using the
old ASID are guaranteed to be visible to CPUs running with the new ASID.
This was found by inspection after reviewing the VMID changes from
Shameer but it looks like a real (yet hard to hit) bug.

arm64: Move .hyp.rodata outside of the \_sdata..\_edata range
commit eb48d154cd0dade56a0e244f0cfa198ea2925ed3 upstream.
The HYP rodata section is currently lumped together with the BSS,
which isn't exactly what is expected (it gets registered with
kmemleak, for example).
Move it away so that it is actually marked RO. As an added
benefit, it isn't registered with kmemleak anymore.

soc: qcom: aoss: Fix the out of bound usage of cooling\_devs
commit a89f355e469dcda129c2522be4fdba00c1c74c83 upstream.
In "qmp\_cooling\_devices\_register", the count value is initially
QMP\_NUM\_COOLING\_RESOURCES, which is 2. Based on the initial count value,
the memory for cooling\_devs is allocated. Then while calling the
"qmp\_cooling\_device\_add" function, count value is post-incremented for
each child node.
This makes the out of bound access to the cooling\_dev array. Fix it by
passing the QMP\_NUM\_COOLING\_RESOURCES definition to devm\_kzalloc() and
initializing the count to 0.
While at it, let's also free the memory allocated to cooling\_dev if no
cooling device is found in DT and during unroll phase.

commit 1b73e588f47397dee6e4bdfd953e0306c60b5fe5 upstream.
Casting a small array of u8 to an unsigned long is \*never\* OK:
- it does funny thing when the array size is less than that of a long,
as it accesses random places in the stack
- it makes everything even more fun with a BE kernel
Fix this by building the unsigned long used as a bitmap byte by byte,
in a way that works across endianess and has no undefined behaviours.
An extra BUILD\_BUG\_ON() catches the unlikely case where the array
would be larger than a single unsigned long.

this check gives false positives because it many not be checked if there's

xen: fix setting of max\_pfn in shared\_info
commit 4b511d5bfa74b1926daefd1694205c7f1bcf677f upstream.
Xen PV guests are specifying the highest used PFN via the max\_pfn
field in shared\_info. This value is used by the Xen tools when saving
or migrating the guest.
Unfortunately this field is misnamed, as in reality it is specifying
the number of pages (including any memory holes) of the guest, so it
is the highest used PFN + 1. Renaming isn't possible, as this is a
public Xen hypervisor interface which needs to be kept stable.
The kernel will set the value correctly initially at boot time, but
when adding more pages (e.g. due to memory hotplug or ballooning) a
real PFN number is stored in max\_pfn. This is done when expanding the
p2m array, and the PFN stored there is even possibly wrong, as it
should be the last possible PFN of the just added P2M frame, and not
one which led to the P2M expansion.
Fix that by setting shared\_info->max\_pfn to the last possible PFN + 1.

powerpc/perf/hv-gpci: Fix counter value parsing
commit f9addd85fbfacf0d155e83dbee8696d6df5ed0c7 upstream.
H\_GetPerformanceCounterInfo (0xF080) hcall returns the counter data in
the result buffer. Result buffer has specific format defined in the PAPR
specification. One of the fields is counter offset and width of the
counter data returned.
Counter data are returned in a unsigned char array in big endian byte
order. To get the final counter data, the values must be left shifted
byte at a time. But commit 220a0c609ad17 ("powerpc/perf: Add support for
the hv gpci (get performance counter info) interface") made the shifting
bitwise and also assumed little endian order. Because of that, hcall
counters values are reported incorrectly.
In particular this can lead to counters go backwards which messes up the
counter prev vs now calculation and leads to huge counter value
reporting:

blk-zoned: allow BLKREPORTZONE without CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN
commit 4d643b66089591b4769bcdb6fd1bfeff2fe301b8 upstream.
A user space process should not need the CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN capability set
in order to perform a BLKREPORTZONE ioctl.
Getting the zone report is required in order to get the write pointer.
Neither read() nor write() requires CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN, so it is reasonable
that a user space process that can read/write from/to the device, also
can get the write pointer. (Since e.g. writes have to be at the write
pointer.)

blk-zoned: allow zone management send operations without CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN
commit ead3b768bb51259e3a5f2287ff5fc9041eb6f450 upstream.
Zone management send operations (BLKRESETZONE, BLKOPENZONE, BLKCLOSEZONE
and BLKFINISHZONE) should be allowed under the same permissions as write().
(write() does not require CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN).
Additionally, other ioctls like BLKSECDISCARD and BLKZEROOUT only check if
the fd was successfully opened with FMODE\_WRITE.
(They do not require CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN).
Currently, zone management send operations require both CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN
and that the fd was successfully opened with FMODE\_WRITE.
Remove the CAP\_SYS\_ADMIN requirement, so that zone management send
operations match the access control requirement of write(), BLKSECDISCARD
and BLKZEROOUT.

btrfs: zoned: fix double counting of split ordered extent
commit f79645df806565a03abb2847a1d20e6930b25e7e upstream.
btrfs\_add\_ordered\_extent\_\*() add num\_bytes to fs\_info->ordered\_bytes.
Then, splitting an ordered extent will call btrfs\_add\_ordered\_extent\_\*()
again for split extents, leading to double counting of the region of
a split extent. These leaked bytes are finally reported at unmount time
as follow:
BTRFS info (device dm-1): at unmount dio bytes count 364544
Fix the double counting by subtracting split extent's size from
fs\_info->ordered\_bytes.

This happens when close\_ctree is called while a dev\_replace hasn't
completed. In close\_ctree, we suspend the dev\_replace, but keep the
replace target around so that we can resume the dev\_replace procedure
when we mount the root again. This is the call trace:
close\_ctree():

btrfs\_close\_devices():
btrfs\_close\_fs\_devices():
btrfs\_close\_one\_device():
ASSERT(!test\_bit(BTRFS\_DEV\_STATE\_REPLACE\_TGT,
&device->dev\_state));
However, since the replace target sticks around, there is a device
with BTRFS\_DEV\_STATE\_REPLACE\_TGT set on close, and we fail the
assertion in btrfs\_close\_one\_device.
To fix this, if we come across the replace target device when
closing, we should properly reset it back to allocation state. This
fix also ensures that if a non-target device has a corrupted state and
has the BTRFS\_DEV\_STATE\_REPLACE\_TGT bit set, the assertion will still
catch the error.

btrfs: fix upper limit for max\_inline for page size 64K
commit 6f93e834fa7c5faa0372e46828b4b2a966ac61d7 upstream.
The mount option max\_inline ranges from 0 to the sectorsize (which is
now equal to page size). But we parse the mount options too early and
before the actual sectorsize is read from the superblock. So the upper
limit of max\_inline is unaware of the actual sectorsize and is limited
by the temporary sectorsize 4096, even on a system where the default
sectorsize is 64K.
Fix this by reading the superblock sectorsize before the mount option
parse.

btrfs: do not do preemptive flushing if the majority is global rsv
commit 114623979405abf0b143f9c6688b3ff00ee48338 upstream.
A common characteristic of the bug report where preemptive flushing was
going full tilt was the fact that the vast majority of the free metadata
space was used up by the global reserve. The hard 90% threshold would
cover the majority of these cases, but to be even smarter we should take
into account how much of the outstanding reservations are covered by the
global block reserve. If the global block reserve accounts for the vast
majority of outstanding reservations, skip preemptive flushing, as it
will likely just cause churn and pain.

btrfs: reduce the preemptive flushing threshold to 90%
commit 93c60b17f2b5fca2c5931d7944788d1ef5f25528 upstream.
The preemptive flushing code was added in order to avoid needing to
synchronously wait for ENOSPC flushing to recover space. Once we're
almost full however we can essentially flush constantly. We were using
98% as a threshold to determine if we were simply full, however in
practice this is a really high bar to hit. For example reports of
systems running into this problem had around 94% usage and thus
continued to flush. Fix this by lowering the threshold to 90%, which is
a more sane value, especially for smaller file systems.

btrfs: wait on async extents when flushing delalloc
commit e16460707e94c3d4c1b5418cb68b28b8efa903b2 upstream.
I've been debugging an early ENOSPC problem in production and finally
root caused it to this problem. When we switched to the per-inode in
38d715f494f2 ("btrfs: use btrfs\_start\_delalloc\_roots in
shrink\_delalloc") I pulled out the async extent handling, because we
were doing the correct thing by calling filemap\_flush() if we had async
extents set. This would properly wait on any async extents by locking
the page in the second flush, thus making sure our ordered extents were
properly set up.
However when I switched us back to page based flushing, I used
sync\_inode(), which allows us to pass in our own wbc. The problem here
is that sync\_inode() is smarter than the filemap\_\* helpers, it tries to
avoid calling writepages at all. This means that our second call could
skip calling do\_writepages altogether, and thus not wait on the pagelock
for the async helpers. This means we could come back before any ordered
extents were created and then simply continue on in our flushing
mechanisms and ENOSPC out when we have plenty of space to use.
Fix this by putting back the async pages logic in shrink\_delalloc. This
allows us to bulk write out everything that we need to, and then we can
wait in one place for the async helpers to catch up, and then wait on
any ordered extents that are created.

btrfs: wake up async\_delalloc\_pages waiters after submit
commit ac98141d140444fe93e26471d3074c603b70e2ca upstream.
We use the async\_delalloc\_pages mechanism to make sure that we've
completed our async work before trying to continue our delalloc
flushing. The reason for this is we need to see any ordered extents
that were created by our delalloc flushing. However we're waking up
before we do the submit work, which is before we create the ordered
extents. This is a pretty wide race window where we could potentially
think there are no ordered extents and thus exit shrink\_delalloc
prematurely. Fix this by waking us up after we've done the work to
create ordered extents.

btrfs: use delalloc\_bytes to determine flush amount for shrink\_delalloc
commit 03fe78cc2942c55cc13be5ca42578750f17204a1 upstream.
We have been hitting some early ENOSPC issues in production with more
recent kernels, and I tracked it down to us simply not flushing delalloc
as aggressively as we should be. With tracing I was seeing us failing
all tickets with all of the block rsvs at or around 0, with very little
pinned space, but still around 120MiB of outstanding bytes\_may\_used.
Upon further investigation I saw that we were flushing around 14 pages
per shrink call for delalloc, despite having around 2GiB of delalloc
outstanding.
Consider the example of a 8 way machine, all CPUs trying to create a
file in parallel, which at the time of this commit requires 5 items to
do. Assuming a 16k leaf size, we have 10MiB of total metadata reclaim
size waiting on reservations. Now assume we have 128MiB of delalloc
outstanding. With our current math we would set items to 20, and then
set to\_reclaim to 20 \* 256k, or 5MiB.
Assuming that we went through this loop all 3 times, for both
FLUSH\_DELALLOC and FLUSH\_DELALLOC\_WAIT, and then did the full loop
twice, we'd only flush 60MiB of the 128MiB delalloc space. This could
leave a fair bit of delalloc reservations still hanging around by the
time we go to ENOSPC out all the remaining tickets.
Fix this two ways. First, change the calculations to be a fraction of
the total delalloc bytes on the system. Prior to this change we were
calculating based on dirty inodes so our math made more sense, now it's
just completely unrelated to what we're actually doing.
Second add a FLUSH\_DELALLOC\_FULL state, that we hold off until we've
gone through the flush states at least once. This will empty the system
of all delalloc so we're sure to be truly out of space when we start
failing tickets.
I'm tagging stable 5.10 and forward, because this is where we started
using the page stuff heavily again. This affects earlier kernel
versions as well, but would be a pain to backport to them as the
flushing mechanisms aren't the same.

io-wq: fix race between adding work and activating a free worker
commit 94ffb0a282872c2f4b14f757fa1aef2302aeaabb upstream.
The attempt to find and activate a free worker for new work is currently
combined with creating a new one if we don't find one, but that opens
io-wq up to a race where the worker that is found and activated can
put itself to sleep without knowing that it has been selected to perform
this new work.
Fix this by moving the activation into where we add the new work item,
then we can retain it within the wqe->lock scope and elimiate the race
with the worker itself checking inside the lock, but sleeping outside of
it.

io-wq: fix wakeup race when adding new work
commit 87df7fb922d18e96992aa5e824aa34b2065fef59 upstream.
When new work is added, io\_wqe\_enqueue() checks if we need to wake or
create a new worker. But that check is done outside the lock that
otherwise synchronizes us with a worker going to sleep, so we can end
up in the following situation:
CPU0 CPU1
lock
insert work
unlock
atomic\_read(nr\_running) != 0
lock
atomic\_dec(nr\_running)
no wakeup needed
Hold the wqe lock around the "need to wakeup" check. Then we can also get
rid of the temporary work\_flags variable, as we know the work will remain
valid as long as we hold the lock.

io\_wq\_put\_and\_exit() always first waits for all threads to complete,
so the only detail left is to zero tctx->io\_wq after the context is

note: one little assumption is that when IO\_WQ\_WORK\_CANCEL, the executor

commit 598ce306f2757cbf3d003de8e244b48863f917be

Makefile: use -Wno-main in the full kernel tree
commit 49832c819ab85b33b7a2a1429c8d067e82be2977 upstream.
When using gcc (SUSE Linux) 7.5.0 (on openSUSE 15.3), I see a build
warning:
kernel/trace/trace\_osnoise.c: In function 'start\_kthread':
kernel/trace/trace\_osnoise.c:1461:8: warning: 'main' is usually a function [-Wmain]
void \*main = osnoise\_main;
^~~~
Quieten that warning by using "-Wno-main". It's OK to use "main" as a
declaration name in the kernel.
Build-tested on most ARCHes.
[ v2: only do it for gcc, since clang doesn't have that particular warning ]
