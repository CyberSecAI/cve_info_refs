SUMMARY

Siemens Simcenter STAR-CCM+ Viewer is affected by a vulnerability that could be triggered when the
application reads scene (.sce) ﬁles. If a user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle with the affected application,
this could lead to a crash, and potentially also to arbitrary code execution or data extraction on the target
host system.

Siemens has released an update for Simcenter STAR-CCM+ Viewer and recommends to update to
the latest version to ﬁx the vulnerability. Siemens recommends to avoid opening of untrusted ﬁles from
unknown sources.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-42024

The starview+.exe application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing scene ﬁles.
This could result in an out of bounds write past the end of an allocated structure.

An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process.
