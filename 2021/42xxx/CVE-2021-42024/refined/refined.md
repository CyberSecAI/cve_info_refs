- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `starview+.exe` application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing scene files (.sce).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists, where the application writes past the end of an allocated structure. This is a CWE-787, Out-of-bounds Write.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to a crash, and potentially arbitrary code execution or data extraction on the target host system. An attacker could execute code in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered when the application reads specially crafted scene (.sce) files. An attacker could trick a user into opening a malicious .sce file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious file. The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system, a user interaction (opening a malicious file) is required. The attack can be performed locally (AV:L).
