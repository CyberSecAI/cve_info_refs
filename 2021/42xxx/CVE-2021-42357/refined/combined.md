Subject: CVE-2021-42357: DOM based XSS Vulnerability in Apache Knox

Severity: moderate

Description:

When using Knox SSO in affected releases, a request could be crafted to
redirect a user to a malicious page due to improper URL parsing.
A request that included a specially crafted
request parameter could be used to redirect the user to a page controlled
by an attacker. This URL would need to be presented to the user outside
the normal request flow through a XSS or phishing campaign.

Mitigation:

1.x users should upgrade to 1.6.1.
Unsupported versions of the 0.x line that include this issue are: 0.13.0, 0.14.0.
and these should upgrade to 1.6.1 as well.
1.0.0 and 1.1.0 are also Unsupported but affected and should upgrade to 1.6.1.

Credit:

Apache Knox would like to thank Kajetan Rostojek for this report
