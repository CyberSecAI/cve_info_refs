**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper URL parsing within the Apache Knox SSO implementation.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Improper URL parsing allows for the injection of malicious URLs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   An attacker can redirect a user to a malicious page.
*   The attacker gains control of the redirected page, potentially leading to phishing attacks, credential theft, or further compromise of user systems.

**Attack vectors:**
*   A specially crafted request parameter within a URL is used.
*   The malicious URL is presented to the user outside the normal request flow, typically via XSS or phishing techniques.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
