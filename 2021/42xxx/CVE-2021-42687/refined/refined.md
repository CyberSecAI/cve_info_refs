The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-42687, found in the Eltima SDK and its derivative products, which are used by various cloud services for USB over Ethernet functionality.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerabilities stem from insecure handling of user-controlled data within the IOCTL handlers 0x22005B and 0x22001B in the `wspvuhub.sys` and `wspusbfilter.sys` drivers. These drivers are responsible for USB redirection in cloud services.
- The vulnerable IOCTL handlers use METHOD_NEITHER for data transfer, which requires the driver to validate, probe, lock, and map the buffer. However, the code lacks proper validation, leading to vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflows due to insecure arithmetic operations on user-controlled data when calculating memory copy sizes.
- Lack of buffer verification, allowing for double fetches and arbitrary pointer dereferences.
- Use of `METHOD_NEITHER` for data transfer, which, without proper handling, leads to security issues.
- The code allocates memory based on one size parameter but copies data based on a different, potentially larger, size parameter, leading to buffer overflows.
- Lack of Access Control Lists (ACL) enforcement on the driver's IOCTLs, which means any process can access them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation to kernel mode, enabling attackers to disable security products, overwrite system components, and corrupt the operating system.
- Arbitrary code execution in kernel mode due to the ability to write arbitrary data to memory locations through the buffer overflow.
- Complete control of the system.
- Potential bypass of sandboxes.
- Lateral movement within a network.
- Remote desktops are also affected.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending specially crafted IOCTL packets (specifically 0x22001B and 0x22005B) to the vulnerable driver with manipulated size parameters using `DeviceIoControl`.
- Exploitation can be achieved from unprivileged user-mode processes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute code on the target machine, even without elevated privileges.
- No specific network access is required, as the vulnerability can be exploited locally.
- Understanding of IOCTL structure and the device driver interaction with Windows Kernel.
