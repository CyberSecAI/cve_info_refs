- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds read
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L) and requires user interaction (UI:R). No privileges are required (PR:N).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to convince a user to open a malicious file. The attacker does not need any special privileges.
