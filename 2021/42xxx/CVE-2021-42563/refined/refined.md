The provided content relates to CVE-2021-42563.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The NI Service Locator, in versions prior to 18.0, has an unquoted service path. This means that the path to the service executable is not enclosed in quotation marks in the Windows service configuration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unquoted Service Path: The service path for `niSvcLoc.exe` is not enclosed in quotes within the Windows service configuration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A local, authenticated user can potentially insert a malicious executable into a directory within the unquoted service path. When the service starts, Windows will execute this malicious file with the elevated privileges of the service, thus escalating the attacker's privileges on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the machine.
- File System Manipulation: The attacker needs to be able to write to a location on the system where the unquoted path points to.
- Service Restart: The vulnerability is triggered when the service starts.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local, authenticated user with write access to a folder in the service path.
- Ability to modify the file system.
- Requires user interaction (restart/start of the vulnerable service) or system reboot.
