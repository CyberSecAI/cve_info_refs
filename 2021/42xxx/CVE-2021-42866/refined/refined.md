- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The "Site Description" field in the `pixelimity/admin/setting.php` page of Pixelimity CMS does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary HTML and JavaScript.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A malicious user can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript or HTML in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to account hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker needs to send an authenticated POST HTTP request to the `admin/setting.php` page with a malicious payload in the "Site Description" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be authenticated as an admin user to access and modify the "Site Description" field.
