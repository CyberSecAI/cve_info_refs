The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities, including CVE-2021-42979, affecting the Eltima SDK and related products used in cloud services. Here's a breakdown of the relevant details regarding CVE-2021-42979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied buffers in the `wspvuhub.sys` and `wspusbfilter.sys` drivers. These drivers utilize IOCTL handlers 0x22005B and 0x22001B which process user-mode data. The IOCTL handlers use `METHOD_NEITHER` for data transfer, which means the driver is responsible for validating, probing, locking, and mapping the buffer itself. However, the code does not properly validate the user-supplied buffer sizes. This leads to vulnerabilities like double fetches and arbitrary pointer dereferences and, specifically, integer overflows due to insecure arithmetic operations when calculating the copy size.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Integer Overflow:** The code performs insecure arithmetic operations on user-controlled data without overflow checks when calculating the size for `memmove`. This allows attackers to cause an integer overflow.
- **Lack of Buffer Validation:** The IOCTL handler fails to validate user-supplied buffer sizes before allocating memory and copying data, allowing for allocation of a smaller buffer and copying of a larger one.
- **Use of METHOD_NEITHER:** Using `METHOD_NEITHER` for data transfer without proper validation opens the door to user mode address manipulation and exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** Exploitation allows an unprivileged user to escalate privileges and execute code in kernel mode.
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution in the kernel.
- **System Compromise:** Attackers can disable security products, overwrite system components, corrupt the operating system, or perform other malicious operations.
- **Lateral Movement:** After gaining local privilege escalation, attackers can potentially move laterally within a network.
- **Bypass Security Products:** The vulnerability can be used to bypass security software by executing code directly in kernel mode.
- **Blue Screen of Death (BSOD):** The provided Proof of Concept shows that exploitation can cause a system crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by a local user, even without privileges, by sending specially crafted IOCTL requests to the vulnerable device driver.
- **Sandboxed Environments:** The lack of ACL enforcement on the device allows triggering of the vulnerability from within sandboxes.
- **Potentially Remote:** The vulnerability is present on both the client and server side of the described services. While primarily described in a local context, the presence of the vulnerability in a server process could potentially expose the service to remote attacks.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local User Access:** An attacker needs to have local access to the system to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver.
- **Ability to Send IOCTLs:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send IOCTL requests to the device driver, which doesn't require any special permissions.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability resides in the `wspvuhub.sys` and `wspusbfilter.sys` drivers, which are part of the WSP protocol used by cloud services like Amazon WorkSpaces for USB redirection.
- The vulnerable code is inherited from Eltima SDK and is present in various products including Amazon Workspaces, NoMachine, Accops HyWorks, Amzetta zPortal, FlexiHub, and Donglify.
- The article also mentions the usage of DeviceTree to examine the security descriptor of the device and confirming that the driver accepts IOCTLs without ACL enforcements.
