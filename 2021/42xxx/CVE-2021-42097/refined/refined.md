Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-42097:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Mailman handles Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) tokens. A valid `csrf_token` generated for one user session can be considered valid for another user session.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF vulnerability:** The application fails to properly validate CSRF tokens, allowing an attacker to potentially craft malicious requests that appear to come from a legitimate, authenticated user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Account takeover:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to perform actions on behalf of another user, potentially leading to complete account takeover. They can trick a victim with an active session to send commands to the server authenticated as the victim.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **CSRF attack:** An attacker would need to craft a malicious request containing a valid CSRF token and trick a logged-in user into submitting it. This could be done through various methods such as:
  - Phishing emails with a link to a malicious page.
  - Embedding a malicious form on a website.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **List membership:** The attacker needs to be a member of the mailing list to exploit this vulnerability.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to trick the victim to trigger the malicious request.
- **Knowledge of vulnerable parameter:** The attacker needs to know the parameter vulnerable to CSRF.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability is present in Mailman versions prior to 2.1.35.
- The fix is available as a patch or by upgrading to version 2.1.35.
- The vulnerability is considered to be of medium severity.
- The issue was reported by Andre Protas, Richard Cloke and Andy Nuttall of Apple.
