```
{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Insufficient input validation in the `check_smart.pl` script allowed an attacker to inject arbitrary parameters to the `smartctl` command via the `-d` parameter.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation",
      "Command injection"
    ],
    "impact": "An unprivileged user (e.g., the nagios user) could modify SMART settings, disable SMART monitoring, shut down a drive, or degrade its performance (e.g., by disabling the read cache).",
    "attack_vectors": "By providing a crafted `-d` parameter to the `check_smart.pl` script which contains a string like `/dev/bus/\\d` as a substring.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to execute the `check_smart.pl` script with sudo privileges (as the nagios user, if configured like that). This is normally granted by the sudoers configuration."
