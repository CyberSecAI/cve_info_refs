- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper neutralization of special elements used in an OS command. The affected product is vulnerable to a parameter injection via passphrase, which enables the attacker to supply uncontrolled input.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: OS Command Injection (CWE-78). The product does not properly sanitize or validate a passphrase, allowing an attacker to inject malicious commands.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the parameter injection via passphrase. An attacker can supply uncontrolled input.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have an authenticated user account. The attack complexity is low, and no user interaction is required.
