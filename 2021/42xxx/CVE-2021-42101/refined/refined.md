Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42101:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the insecure loading of an OpenSSL configuration file. The process loads this file from an unsecured location.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path Element: The application loads a configuration file from a location where a low-privileged user could potentially modify or replace it.
- Privilege Escalation: By controlling the OpenSSL configuration file, an attacker can gain elevated privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the SYSTEM user, leading to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- File manipulation: The attacker must be able to modify or replace the vulnerable OpenSSL configuration file.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Low-privileged code execution: The attacker needs initial access to execute code on the target system with limited privileges.
- File write access:  The attacker needs the ability to write to the directory where the vulnerable OpenSSL config file is loaded from.

**Additional Information:**
- Affected product: Trend Micro Apex One
- CVSS Score: 7.0 (AV:L/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)
- A patch has been released by Trend Micro to address the vulnerability.
