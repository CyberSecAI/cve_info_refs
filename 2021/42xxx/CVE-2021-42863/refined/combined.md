### @galpeter **[galpeter](/galpeter)** commented [Oct 15, 2021](#issue-1027388363)

During the execution of the TypedArray filter method it is possible

to have a different sized output TypedArray than the input one.

When copying the data to the output array the values must be

correctly converted to the output TypedArray's value range.

Fixes: [#4793](https://github.com/jerryscript-project/jerryscript/issues/4793)

Sorry, something went wrong.
