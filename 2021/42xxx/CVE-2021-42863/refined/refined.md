The provided content is related to CVE-2021-42863.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from incorrect handling of value conversions when copying data to the output TypedArray during the execution of the `TypedArray.filter()` method. Specifically, when the output TypedArray has a different size/type than the input array, the values are not properly converted to the output array's value range.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Type confusion due to incorrect value conversion logic in the `TypedArray.filter()` method.
- Potential for out-of-bounds write/read due to incorrect handling of different sized TypedArrays during the copy process. The original bug report mentions the crash could be turned into an arbitrary read/write.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Crash (as indicated by the initial bug report with an assertion failure)
- Arbitrary read/write (as mentioned in the initial bug report)
- Potential memory corruption and further exploitation leading to code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a malicious Javascript using the `TypedArray.filter()` method with different constructor types

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to execute JavaScript code within an environment running the vulnerable version of JerryScript.
- No specific position is needed to trigger this, it can be exploited by running a crafted javascript in an application that uses JerryScript.
