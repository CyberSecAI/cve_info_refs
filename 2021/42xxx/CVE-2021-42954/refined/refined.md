- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application has weak file permission ACLs (Access Control Lists) assigned in various locations.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Full control permissions granted to authenticated users (non-admin) for sensitive files/folders (database, config, executable batch files, logs).
    - Read permissions granted to all users (including non-admin and potentially guest) for files containing server private keys, logs, agent communication keys, config files, backups.
    - Execute permissions granted to non-admin users for batch files that can perform sensitive operations (reset-password, delete, update, migrate).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Loss of confidentiality due to exposure of sensitive data like database connection strings, server private keys, and other configuration data.
    - Loss of integrity due to the ability to modify configuration files and execute sensitive operations.
    - Loss of availability due to the ability to execute sensitive operations, such as password resets.
    - Privilege escalation and backdooring by replacing executables.
    - Log tampering due to write access on log files.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access to the system where the application is installed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Any user with access to the system where the application is installed, with any user role (admin/non-admin).
