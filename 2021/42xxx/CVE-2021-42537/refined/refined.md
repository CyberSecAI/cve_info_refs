Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-42537:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper Restriction of XML External Entity Reference (XXE).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The software processes XML documents that can include XML entities with URIs pointing to external resources. This allows an attacker to embed documents outside the intended control sphere into the product's output.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Disclosure of local files
* Potential access to sensitive files
* The vulnerability can lead to the product embedding incorrect documents into its output
* The document also mentions the possibility of accessing NTLM hashes as a general impact of the vulnerabilities listed in the advisory (though it is not specific to this vulnerability alone).

**Attack Vectors:**
* Network-based attacks
* Exploitation requires a user interaction (UI:R), likely via a specially crafted XML document.
* Attack complexity is high (AC:H), suggesting some specific conditions must be met to exploit this vulnerability successfully.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to be able to send a malicious XML document to the affected product
* The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability.

**CVSS Score**:
* Base Score: 5.9
* Vector String: AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:L/A:N
