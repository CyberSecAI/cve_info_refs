```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The `renderAsset` function in `fileManager.cfc` does not properly sanitize or validate the `filePath` parameter, allowing path traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Path traversal",
     "Insecure direct object reference"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can read arbitrary files from the server's filesystem, potentially including sensitive configuration files, source code, or other data.",
  "Attack vectors": "By crafting a malicious URL with path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `filePath` parameter of the `/index.cfm/_api/asset/image/` endpoint.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker only needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication or special privileges required."
