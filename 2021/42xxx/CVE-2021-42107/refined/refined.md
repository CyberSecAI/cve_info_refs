- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability arises from allowing an untrusted process to impersonate the client of a pipe within the Security Agent of Trend Micro Apex One.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unnecessary privileges and improper handling of process impersonation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level, and execute arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: Local access is required to execute code on the target system, then exploiting the pipe impersonation vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system before exploiting the vulnerability.
