- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The TOTOLINK EX1200T router has a telnet service that can be enabled without authorization, and the device ships with default credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
  - Unauthorized telnet activation via a POST request to `/cgi-bin/cstecgi.cgi?action=1` with the data `{"topicurl":"setTelnetCfg","telnet_enabled":"1"}`.
  - Default credentials (`root:cs2012`) present in the firmware file `product.ini`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized remote access to the router's system by enabling telnet and using the default credentials, leading to potential control over the device and the network.
- **Attack vectors:**
  - Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the router's web interface to enable telnet.
  - Connecting to the telnet service with the default username and password.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
  - The attacker needs to be on the same network as the router or have network access to the router's web interface.
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router.
