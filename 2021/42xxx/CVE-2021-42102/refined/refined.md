Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-42102

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure loading of an OpenSSL configuration file by the Trend Micro Apex One Security Agent. The process loads the configuration file from an unsecured location.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled Search Path Element: The application loads a configuration file from a location where a low-privileged user could place a malicious file.
- Insecure Configuration: The OpenSSL configuration file loading is not done securely, allowing for potential manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: A local attacker can escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level.
- Arbitrary Code Execution: Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local Access: The attacker must have local access to the system.
- File Manipulation: The attacker needs to be able to place a malicious OpenSSL configuration file in the location where the application loads it from.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Low-Privilege Code Execution: The attacker must first gain the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
- Local File System Access: The attacker must have the ability to write to a specific location on the file system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was reported to Trend Micro on 2021-07-09 and a fix was released by 2021-10-19.
- The vulnerability affects installations of Trend Micro Apex One Security Agent.
- This vulnerability is rated with a CVSS score of 7.0, with an attack vector of "Local", low privilege, and high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
