REDCap is a secure web application for building and managing online surveys and databases. While REDCap can be used to collect virtually any type of data in any environment (including compliance with 21 CFR Part 11, FISMA, HIPAA, and GDPR), it is specifically geared to support online and offline data capture for research studies and operations. The REDCap Consortium, a vast support network of collaborators, is composed of thousands of active institutional partners in over one hundred countries who utilize and support their own individual REDCap systems. Please visit the [Join](https://projectredcap.org/partners/join/) page to learn how your non-profit organization can join the consortium, or explore the first section on our [FAQ](https://projectredcap.org/about/faq/) for other options to use REDCap.
