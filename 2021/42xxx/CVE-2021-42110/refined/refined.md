Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a DLL hijacking issue in the Allegro Windows FTP module. This module is not installed by default.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The core weakness is the susceptibility to DLL hijacking. This occurs when a program loads a malicious DLL instead of the intended legitimate one, due to the way it searches for and loads DLL files.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploitation allows a standard user to execute arbitrary commands with the highest system privileges (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM). This means the attacker gains complete control over the affected system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local, meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the machine where the vulnerable Allegro Windows software is installed. It exploits the way the application loads DLLs.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** A standard user account is sufficient to carry out the exploit. The attacker must be able to write to a location where the vulnerable application searches for DLLs.

**Summary of the vulnerability**
The vulnerability resides in the Allegro Windows FTP module which can be exploited by a standard user through DLL hijacking to gain system level privileges.
