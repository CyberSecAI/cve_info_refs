Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42358:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The document directly mentions "CVE-2021-42358" within the description of the "Contact Form With Captcha" plugin vulnerability. The description aligns with the general pattern of CSRF leading to XSS vulnerabilities, and the vulnerable plugin is identified.

**2. Extracted Vulnerability Information:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability arises from a **missing nonce validation** in the `~/cfwc-form.php` file during contact form submission within the "Contact Form With Captcha" WordPress plugin.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks due to missing nonce validation. This allows attackers to craft malicious requests that can be executed by a victim who is authenticated to the WordPress site.
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** Successful exploitation of the CSRF vulnerability can lead to reflected XSS as the plugin does not sanitize user input.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows unauthenticated attackers to inject arbitrary web scripts into the website. If an administrator visits a page with this injected javascript it will execute in the context of their session. This could lead to a complete site compromise.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can create a malicious link or form that, when interacted with by a logged-in administrator, sends a forged request to modify the plugin settings with injected javascript.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated to the website.
    *   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into performing an action, such as clicking a link or submitting a malicious form. This makes social engineering tactics necessary to carry out the attack successfully.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is present in versions of the plugin up to and including 1.6.2.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Yuga Futatsuki, Cryptography Laboratory in Tokyo Denki University.
*   A patch is not available, and the recommended remediation is to uninstall the plugin.
