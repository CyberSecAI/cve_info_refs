Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42996:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a vulnerability in the Eltima SDK, specifically within the IOCTL handlers 0x22005B and 0x22001B of the `wspvuhub.sys` and `wspusbfilter.sys` drivers. These handlers use `METHOD_NEITHER` for data transfer, requiring them to validate, probe, lock, and map user-supplied buffers. The vulnerability arises because these handlers lack proper input validation and perform insecure arithmetic operations on user-controlled data when calculating the size of the data to be copied with `memmove`. This allows for integer overflows.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The IOCTL handlers do not validate the user-supplied buffer sizes, specifically when allocating and copying data.
*   **Insecure Arithmetic:** The handlers perform arithmetic operations on user-provided data without any overflow checks, leading to integer overflows when calculating copy sizes.
*   **Use of `METHOD_NEITHER` without proper handling:** The driver utilizes `METHOD_NEITHER` for data transfer which requires extra care with user controlled data, which the driver fails to perform, specifically when validating, probing, locking and mapping user-supplied buffers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to gain elevated privileges, allowing them to execute code in kernel mode.
*   **Security Product Bypass:** The vulnerability can be used to bypass security products.
*   **System Corruption:** Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to overwrite system components, corrupt the operating system, or perform malicious operations unimpeded.
* **Arbitrary code execution**: Due to the ability to control the size and data being copied, this vulnerability can be used to achieve arbitrary code execution.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** An attacker with local access to a vulnerable system can exploit the vulnerability, even without administrative privileges.
*   **Potential for Remote Exploitation:** While not directly stated, the document notes that the vulnerability exists on both the client and server side, which would make remote exploitation possible. The vulnerability can also be triggered from sandboxes.
*   **IOCTL call**: The vulnerability is triggered by sending crafted IRP packets to the vulnerable IOCTL handlers (0x22005B and 0x22001B).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs the ability to execute code on a vulnerable system.
*   **Ability to send IOCTL requests:** The attacker must be able to interact with the device driver via IOCTL calls which are not protected by Access Control Lists (ACL).

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability affects multiple products that use the Eltima SDK for USB redirection, including Amazon Workspaces, NoMachine, and Accops HyWorks.
*   The vulnerability exists in both client and server side software of the affected products.
*   The vulnerable drivers are `wspvuhub.sys` and `wspusbfilter.sys`.
*   The vulnerability was discovered and reported by SentinelLabs.
*   Patches have been released by the affected vendors.
