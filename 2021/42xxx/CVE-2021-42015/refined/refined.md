- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper caching of file documents leading to information disclosure. The specific CWE is CWE-525: Use of Web Browser Cache Containing Sensitive Information.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local attacker can read cached file documents by exploring the browser cache, potentially exposing sensitive information.
- **Attack vectors:** Local access to the machine where the browser cache is stored.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A local attacker needs access to the system where the browser has cached the files. No special privileges are needed.
