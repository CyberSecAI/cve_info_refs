{
  "CVE-2021-42365": {
    "Description": "The Asgaros Forums WordPress plugin is vulnerable to Stored Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient escaping via the `name` parameter found in the ~/admin/tables/admin-structure-table.php file which allowed attackers with administrative user access to inject arbitrary web scripts, in versions up to and including 1.15.13. This affects multi-site installations where `unfiltered_html` is disabled for administrators, and sites where `unfiltered_html` is disabled.",
    "Root cause": "Insufficient escaping of the 'name' parameter",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting",
       "Insufficient input sanitization",
        "Insufficient output escaping"
     ],
    "Impact": "Injection of arbitrary web scripts that execute when an administrator views the affected page",
     "Attack vectors": "Through the plugin's admin interface by manipulating the 'name' parameter.",
    "Required capabilities": "Administrative access to the WordPress site."
