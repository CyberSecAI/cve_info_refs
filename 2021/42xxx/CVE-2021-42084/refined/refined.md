- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A series of specially crafted requests can cause Zammad to execute an endless loop.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability lies in how Zammad processes specific requests, leading to an infinite loop.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can cause a denial of service (DoS) by making the application unresponsive.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack is performed via crafted requests sent to the Zammad application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs valid agent credentials to send the crafted requests.
