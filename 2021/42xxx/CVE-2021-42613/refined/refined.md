Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-42613:

**CVE-2021-42613:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a double free in the `cleanup_index()` function in `index.c`, triggered by how the `get_token` function within `input.c` frees memory. Specifically, the issue arises in `get_token` where `sfree(rsc.text)` is called in multiple code paths.

*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Double Free:** The core issue is that the same memory location is freed twice, leading to a corruption in the heap.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   The immediate impact is a crash of the application (halibut) due to heap corruption. While the provided information doesn't detail further exploitation leading to code execution, double frees are a common path toward remote code execution vulnerabilities, depending on the surrounding context.

*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is triggered by processing a specially crafted input file.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to provide a malicious input file to the halibut application, specifically crafted to trigger the double free in `cleanup_index()`. The user needs to run the `halibut` utility with this malicious input.

**Additional Details:**

*   The content provides more details about the vulnerable code and functions than the placeholder CVE description.
*   The content specifies that the issue is in `index.c:203` within the function `cleanup_index`.
*   The double free is triggered when using the `--winhelp` output format option of halibut.
*   The content includes a proof-of-concept (PoC) file that can be used to reproduce the issue and provides a stack trace showing the crash. The PoC is linked as `poc-halibut-winhelp-df`.
*   The provided stack trace shows that the crash is a result of `double free or corruption (fasttop)` detected by the memory allocator.
* The content also references the related vulnerabilities CVE-2021-42612 and CVE-2021-42614, both of which are use-after-free vulnerabilities.
