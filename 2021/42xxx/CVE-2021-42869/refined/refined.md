- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper sanitization of user-supplied input in the "Last Name" field when adding a patient in Chikitsa 2.0.2.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. Specifically, stored XSS.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view pages displaying patient data. This can lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors**: An authenticated attacker can send a POST HTTP request to the `/patient/insert` page, including a malicious payload in the "Last Name" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be authenticated with access to the admin panel of Chikitsa 2.0.2 and have the ability to add new patients.
