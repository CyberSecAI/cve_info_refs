The provided content is related to CVE-2021-42614.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the `get_token` function within `input.c`. Specifically, the issue stems from `sfree` calls within this function which can lead to freeing memory that is still in use or freeing the same memory twice.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The content describes a use-after-free vulnerability in `info_width_internal()` in `bk_info.c`. The root cause of this, as well as other discovered vulnerabilities is determined to be related to improper memory management in `get_token`, which involves multiple calls to `sfree`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Exploitation can lead to a crash due to a double free or use-after-free condition. The content demonstrates this with stack traces.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors involve crafting specific input files that, when processed by Halibut with the `--winhelp`, `--text`, or `--info` options, trigger the vulnerable code paths in `cleanup_index()` or `info_width_internal()`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted input file to Halibut and execute the program with specific command-line arguments to trigger the vulnerable code paths. No special privileges or network access is required other than the ability to execute the program and provide input files.
