{
  "CVE-2021-42716": {
    "root_cause": "The PNM loader in stb_image incorrectly interprets 16-bit PGM files as 8-bit when converting to RGBA, leading to a buffer overflow when later reinterpreting the result as a 16-bit buffer.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect type conversion",
      "Heap-based buffer overflow",
	  "Out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially crash a service using stb_image, or read up to 1024 bytes of non-consecutive heap data without control over the read location.",
     "attack_vectors": [
        "Loading a specially crafted 16-bit PGM file with 4 components using the stb_image library."
      ],
    "required_capabilities": "Ability to provide a specially crafted 16-bit PGM image file to an application using stb_image."
