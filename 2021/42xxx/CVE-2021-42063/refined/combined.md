=======================
Product:        SAP Knowledge Warehouse
Vendor URL:
<https://help.sap.com/viewer/816f1f952d244bbf9dd5063e2a0e66b0/7.5.21/en-US/4dc9605e4a9d6522e10000000a15822b.html>
Type:           Cross-Site Scripting [CWE-79]
Date found:     2021-09-21
Date published: 2022-03-17
CVSSv3 Score:   6.1 (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N)
CVE:            CVE-2021-42063

2. CREDITS
==========
This vulnerability was discovered and researched by Julien Ahrens from
RCE Security.

3. VERSIONS AFFECTED
====================
SAP Knowledge Warehouse - versions 7.30, 7.31, 7.40, 7.50

4. INTRODUCTION
===============
The SAP Knowledge Warehouse (SAP KW) is the SAP Solution for all the
material used in training, documentation and handbooks.

(from the vendor's homepage)

5. VULNERABILITY DETAILS
========================
The endpoint at /SAPIrExtHelp is vulnerable to an unauthenticated
reflected Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability when user-supplied input
to the URI is processed by the web application. Since the application
does not properly validate and sanitize this input, it is possible to
place arbitrary script code onto the same page.

The following Proof-of-Concept triggers this vulnerability:
[https://localhost/SAPIrExtHelp/random/%22%3e%3c%53%56%47%20%4f%4e%4c%4f%41%44%3d%26%23%39%37%26%23%31%30%38%26%23%31%30%31%26%23%31%31%34%26%23%31%31%36%28%26%23%78%36%34%26%23%78%36%66%26%23%78%36%33%26%23%78%37%35%26%23%78%36%64%26%23%78%36%35%26%23%78%36%65%26%23%78%37%34%26%23%78%32%65%26%23%78%36%34%26%23%78%36%66%26%23%78%36%64%26%23%78%36%31%26%23%78%36%39%26%23%78%36%65%29%3e.asp](https://localhost/SAPIrExtHelp/random/%22%3E%3CSVG%20ONLOAD%3D%26%2397%26%23108%26%23101%26%23114%26%23116%28%26%23x64%26%23x6f%26%23x63%26%23x75%26%23x6d%26%23x65%26%23x6e%26%23x74%26%23x2e%26%23x64%26%23x6f%26%23x6d%26%23x61%26%23x69%26%23x6e%29%3E.asp)

6. RISK
=======
To successfully exploit this vulnerability an unauthenticated or
authenticated user must be tricked into visiting an arbitrary website
/ link.

The vulnerability can be used to temporarily embed arbitrary script
code into the context of the web interface, which offers a wide range
of possible attacks such as redirecting the user to a malicious page,
spoofing content on the page or attacking the browser and its plugins.

7. SOLUTION
===========
Update SAP Knowledge Warehouse to the latest version.
