The provided content is related to CVE-2021-42056.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause lies in the insecure permissions set by the SafeNet Authentication Client (SAC) during installation on multiple directories and files under `/tmp` and `/var/tmp`. Specifically, the directories are set to `chmod 777` and files are set to `chmod 666`. These directories and files are used by the SAC during different operations.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* **CWE-378:** Creation of Temporary File With Insecure Permissions - The temporary files created by the SAC have world-writable permissions.
* **CWE-377:** Insecure Temporary File - The files are created with predictable, static names, in world-writable directories.
* **Insecure File Permissions:** The overly permissive permissions on the temporary directories and files allow any local user to read, write and execute these files.
* **Symlink Vulnerability:** Due to insecure permissions, a local attacker can create symlinks to arbitrary files on the system to then be overwritten by the SAC.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* **Arbitrary File Overwrite:** An attacker can overwrite any file on the system, as the operations that access these files are performed with root privileges (SACSrv). This could be used to overwrite system files and gain root access.
* **Privilege Escalation:** By overwriting files such as `/etc/shadow`, an attacker can modify user credentials including the root user, and effectively gain root access.
* **Malicious Code Injection:** A malicious actor can modify legitimate files (e.g., /etc/shadow) with malicious code and gain unauthorized access.

**Attack vectors:**
* Local access is required
* The attack vector is a symlink attack. The attacker creates a symbolic link from a file created by SAC (e.g. under `/tmp/eToken.lock` or `/tmp/eToken.hid`) to a target file on the system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to have local user access to the system where the SafeNet Authentication Client is installed.
* The attacker needs the ability to create symlinks and execute commands on the system.

**Additional Notes:**
* The issue is present in the latest versions of SAC, as of 2023-07-28
* This vulnerability has been confirmed on both Linux and Windows based systems, although the symlink exploitation is easier on Linux
* This is a privilege escalation vulnerability and could lead to complete compromise of a target system.
