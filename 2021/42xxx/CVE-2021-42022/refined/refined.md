- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly neutralize special elements within the pathname when downloading files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Path Traversal (CWE-22), leading to arbitrary file read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can read arbitrary files from the application server, potentially including critical files.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote network access.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Authenticated user with the ability to initiate file downloads. The affected file download function is disabled by default.
