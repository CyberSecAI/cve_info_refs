Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42057:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the unsafe use of `eval` within the `evalInContext` function in the `src/api/inline-api.ts` file of the obsidian-dataview plugin. This allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unsafe use of `eval`:** The plugin directly evaluates user-supplied input using `eval`, which is a well-known security risk. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary code.
*   **Lack of Sandboxing:**  DataviewJS blocks run with the same permissions as the plugin, which grants access to Node.js functions and other libraries that plugins should not have access to.
*   **Default JavaScript Execution:** Prior to version 0.4.13, JavaScript queries were enabled by default, increasing the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the user's system.
*   **System Compromise:** The attacker could potentially compromise the user's entire system, not just their Obsidian vault, since they have access to node functions
*   **Data Exfiltration:** The attacker could access and exfiltrate data, as they have access to Obsidian APIs to make HTTP calls to external URLs.
*   **Malware Installation:**  The attacker could install malware or other malicious software on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Markdown Files:** An attacker can craft a malicious markdown file that, when opened by a user with the Dataview plugin, executes arbitrary code.
*   **Copy-Pasting Malicious Code:** Users may copy malicious code from the internet or other sources into their Obsidian vault, and if DataviewJS is enabled, it would be executed.
*   **Shared Vaults:** In environments where users share vaults, a malicious user can inject code that will execute on other users' systems.
*   **HTML Injection:**  Attackers could hide malicious code within HTML that, when copied, would inject the malicious dataviewjs code into the users clipboard.
*   **Compromised Integrations:** Applications with Obsidian integration could potentially be leveraged to insert malicious code into vaults.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Create/Modify Markdown Files:** The attacker needs to be able to create or modify a markdown file that is opened by the victim.
*   **Target User with Dataview Plugin Installed:** The victim must have the Dataview plugin installed and, before version 0.4.13, must have JavaScript queries enabled. After version 0.4.13, the user must re-enable the JavaScript query functionality for the exploit to work.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue was initially privately disclosed, after which the maintainer changed the default behavior of Dataview to no longer enable JavaScript queries by default (version 0.4.13).
*   The maintainer is looking into sandboxing DataviewJS blocks using the `vm2` library.
*   There is an ongoing discussion regarding the trade-offs between security and functionality. Some users want the ability to run arbitrary code for legitimate use cases.
*  A mitigation was introduced to allow users to customize the keyword used to begin a dataviewjs block.
*  The maintainer has added a warning to the README.md file.
