| Describe the bug I discovered a way to craft malicious markdown files that will cause the obsidian-dataview plugin to execute arbitrary commands on users’ systems. This is due to the unsafe use of eval within the [evalInContext](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/blob/f897a178a678c2fa625de018c6722488e237a5b4/src/api/inline-api.ts#L306) function located in src/api/inline-api.ts.  This has been assigned a CVE of [CVE-2021-42057](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-42057) for tracking. To Reproduce The following proof-of-concept can be used to display a file on a user’s system by executing the `cat` command:  ``` ```dataviewjs require("child_process").exec("cat /etc/passwd",(_0,stdout,_1) => dv.span(stdout));"" ```  ```  A malicious user could leverage this vulnerability to execute arbitrary code on other users' systems by getting them to open an untrusted markdown file. This is especially dangerous in environments where users share vaults. Expected behavior DataviewJS should not make an unsafe call to eval using user supplied input. Additional Context Shortly after we privately disclosed this issue, [@blacksmithgu](https://github.com/blacksmithgu) promptly changed the default behavior of Dataview to no longer enable JavaScript Queries by default (see release [0.4.13](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/releases/tag/0.4.13)). This helps protect new dataview users and provides a way for existing dataview users to mitigate this issue by disabling the JavaScript Query functionality when opening untrusted markdown.  [@blacksmithgu](https://github.com/blacksmithgu) is currently working on additional solutions and provided permission for us to open a public issue here for tracking. |

| DataviewJS blocks run with the same permissions that Dataview-the-plugin has, which apparently is much more than I initially expected - you can access node functions and various other libraries which plugins *probably* shouldn't have access too!  I am looking at improved sandboxing for DataviewJS blocks via the `vm2` library, which will incur a performance overhead and block all external `require` calls (except through possibly a whitelisted list of modules / other user scripts). Another alternative would be for Obsidian to prevent plugins from using these scary APIs in the first place. |

| As for risk, the main takeaway is: *be careful with what DataviewJS code you copy-paste from the internet into your vault*. Don't run minified code or code that looks like gibberish, and make sure any shared code has been vetted by others (or you understand it yourself).  The main risk is through requiring node packages or making suspicious HTTP calls (through the Obsidian API) to URLs you don't recognized. |

| From my perspective js execution is a significant feature that I don't want to see removed.  I do not agree that arbitration execution of dataview queries within *trusted* markdown code is a security vulnerability.  Downloading a bash script or any from the internet is not in itself harmful as it wont do anything until you execute it. And you should only execute code from trusted sources.  The question then becomes do I trust the markdown files in my vault.  Yes, I wrote them and if I find a snippet of obsidian markdown online containing dataviewjs I am certainly going to review it before copying it into my vault.  However, it is not generally expected that markdown files contain executable code and thus I fully agree that it should be disabled by default.  The user has already acknowledged that enabling plugins allows arbitrary code execution and starts with plugins disabled.  The plugin also requires enabling js explicitly.  Could more be done? perhaps. It might be a good idea to create a .dataview/trusted file with list of markdown files. If dataview detects js in a file not in this list it could prompt the user.  But I personally don't want to be prompted every time I generate a new markdown file from my daily notes template.  Enabling this feature does require the user to be mindful of the code he adds to his vault but that in itself does not make it a bug.  I also do not want the js to be "sandboxed" in fact I want to call http endpoints to import tasks from jira and execute a shell script to pull in my google calendar.  I could potentially make these into plugins, but I love the ability to use dataviewjs to prototype these things. |

| I agree with [@kurtharriger](https://github.com/kurtharriger) - arbitrary code should not be protected. The only caviat I would say is that if you did want to address this issue, it should be in the `README.md`. Something basically saying,  Warning! As with all community Obsidian plugins, this plugin uses third party code. Due to the nature of this plugin, you as the user of the plugin must be aware of the new level of potential arbitrary code being run with `dataviewjs`. Be careful to understand the code you run, as code run is not sandboxed. This means that if you run malicious code (hypothetically by copying/pasting), not only could your vault be compromised, but any data on your computer may be as well. |

| [@kurtharriger](https://github.com/kurtharriger) [@KjellConnelly](https://github.com/KjellConnelly) I agree with both of your points. To be clear, I am absolutely not removing JS functionality (I use it for everything personally), and I am also trying to avoid annoying security popups since people will just always press "Yes" on them anyway by the time they reach them (if you don't trust the code, you wouldn't copy it into your vault in the first place!).  The sandboxing will be toggleable with a "I know what I'm doing"-type setting that turns it off; it will still allow AJAX and full use of Obsidian/Dataview APIs, it just blocks node library `requires()` by default.  The README notice is a good idea - I will add that as a disclaimer in the README. |

| [@blacksmithgu](https://github.com/blacksmithgu) Great idea with just blocking requires. I personally hate how difficult it is to deal with permissions sometimes. It can get quite convoluted. And `require()` is basically the tip of the iceberg when it comes to node. So beginners won't have too much trouble understanding how to use node vs much more.  By the way, just to let you know, developers can access many node features directly from window.app within obsidian. For instance, fs is one module I use without require. I don't know if it's a full port or a wrapper or what, but I do use it to generate non .md files. |

| I don't understand this is an issue. You are in complete control of the documents you place in your obsidian folder.  If you don't know what a script does don’t use it.  I recently switched to using Logseq instead of Obsidian. Logseq is also an electron app, but it does run scripts in a sandboxed environment with no option to elevate privileges.  This was a huge issue for me when I tried to develop a plugin that would query things3 database  <https://discuss.logseq.com/t/privileged-plugins/4746>  I eventually came up with a workaround where the user could install an additional app that runs as in background listening on HTTP port as an api server to enable queries from logseq maybe its better this way and maybe its not as having an app listening on http port exposes new venerabilities that did not exist when queried directly from electron. And it is certainly more complex for both the user and the developer.  <https://discuss.logseq.com/t/things-3-plugin-proof-of-concept-and-feedback/4821>  Having the option to sandbox scripts might be nice option to have, and logseq might provide a template on how it can be done. However it is not trivial and may significantly limit its capabilities requiring workaround like mine to access the filesystem for legitimate use cases.  I think most users of dataviewjs have sufficient knowledge of js to evaluate the code the choose to run and if they don't care about what the code they run then they shouldn't install or blame the plugin for their laziness any more than one should blame node itself for its ability to run arbitrary code.  With great power comes great responsibility. |

| [@kurtharriger](https://github.com/kurtharriger)  I am aware of the risks of evaluating code one does not understand. Luckily, I'm in a position, where I can (and will) do that. However, there are other attack vectors, such as adding content using a share sheet into your Obsidian vault. There are ways to hide/obscure malicious code when rendering HTML. Since we are getting more applications with dedicated Obsidian integration, there is a non-trivial chance, that someone with knowledge of this vulnerability will decide to target it and use it.  I understand the complexity of this issue and I would be the last one to suggest removing dataviewjs queries. It's an amazing and essential tool in my workflow. I did not intend to convey the "Why is this still not fixed?!" kind of message (and I hope I did not do that accidentally). [@blacksmithgu](https://github.com/blacksmithgu) did amazing work by building this plugin and by providing some layers of protection against malicious attacks. Since the issue is still in status "Open" and [@blacksmithgu](https://github.com/blacksmithgu) himself/herself mentioned that he/she is looking into options to sandbox the code evaluation I do not think that asking for a status update is an unreasonable thing to do.  edit: I do appreciate you sharing your experience with developing a Logseq integration. |

| Fair enough.  I do agree that sharing documents and workspaces introduces some legitimate security risks, and a feature to sandbox js could be very valuable feature in that context.  But I disagree with the classification that this is a bug that needs to or should be fixed -- if that means removing the ability to execute arbitrary code entirely. |

| That's a good point. I checked and Templater also has access to Node internals in the JavaScript template directive as well. I'm not familiar with CustomJS plugin.  I guess the main takeaway here is that if we're going to use these plugins, we need to be careful about the kind of content we add to Obsidian programmatically. This includes integrations (Readwise, PDF highlight extractors) and even native share functionalities like IOS/Android share buttons. |

| I think the vulnerability is much more significant in Dataview than it is in Templater, since Templater only executes JS on file creation (at which point the file only contains whatever was in the template) or by the user deliberately running the Templater command on an existing file, whereas Dataview can execute JS from an untrusted source without the user intending to execute JS or even use Dataview in that file.  Let's take an attack vector that [@lkarbownik](https://github.com/lkarbownik) mentioned for example: It's pretty trivial to create HTML that displays some completely normal-looking text, but on copy, copies a malicious script that is wrapped in a dataviewjs block to the user's clipboard. If an unsuspecting user were to copy that seemingly innocuous text and then paste it into their Obsidian vault, if they have DataviewJS enabled, the malicious code would execute. They may quickly realize that the pasted text does not match the text that they copied, but by then the code has already executed. For this to happen with Templater, the user would have to not notice that the pasted text doesn't match, and then manually run Templater on that file.  I love the power of Dataview (thanks [@blacksmithgu](https://github.com/blacksmithgu)!!) and definitely don't want arbitrary JS execution removed from it, but I also don't think just telling users to be careful with what they paste is sufficient, as it requires what I think is an unreasonable amount of care to guard against vulnerabilities like the one mentioned above. The careful approach would be to either completely avoid pasting external content into Obsidian or to always first paste any text into a plain text editor and manually check it before then pasting it into Obsidian. Most users will not be willing to go to these lengths, which leaves them exposed.  One simple mitigation for the specific issue mentioned above is to allow users to customize the keyword used to begin a dataviewjs block (I've done this on my local copy by changing the keyword [here](https://github.com/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/blob/dbd3f9771dd2e0b0c0afbd7bfb42478620becfb7/src/main.ts#L54)).  Other rough ideas (with no claims about feasibility):   * Allow user to enable/disable DataviewJS via frontmatter or based on file path. That way users only need to practice extreme caution when they are in those files/directories (and can also mark those files as dangerous by styling them differently with CSS). * Limit JS execution to code in a specific directory. Code from other directories can reference the functions defined in these other files. * Allow DataviewJS everywhere but detect paste (is this possible?) and disable DataviewJS for blocks that were pasted in until the user marks them as safe. |

| I like the idea of marking a block as safe the first time it is executed. Potentially could hash the content and save hash of user approved scripts in the plugin config file. This could get annoying if one is trying to write a template and making frequent changes, so perhaps also an option to temporarily execute all scripts, and while disabled display a banner at top of page warning that dataviewjs script authorization is currently disabled, click here to reenable. |

| Along the lines of [@eyuelt](https://github.com/eyuelt)'s example, imagining a website with a "copy to clipboard" button for anything (or maybe even automatically copying something to clipboard if possible), especially something like one of those rip-off stack overflow aggregators. Something like that where people would often copy some info and paste it into obsidian.  Also considering in shared vault, your "friend/colleague" temporarily enabling JS execution, running some remote commands on your system, and then disabling JS execution again unbeknownst to you. But I guess in that sense, couldn't anyone add arbitrary javascript to any plugin being shared/synced in the .obsidian folder to cause havoc? Then essentially any shared vault opens up arbitrary code execution? |

[0.4.13](/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/tree/0.4.13)

[`c6a4f14`](/blacksmithgu/obsidian-dataview/commit/c6a4f14e40d669d0886cb2a5c7441e32a9a9c5a6)

# 0.4.13

Bugfix release which adds fancy rendering to inline-inline fields and includes a few bugfixes.

## Pretty Inline Fields

Inline fields of the form `[key:: value]` will now be rendered with fancy new HTML! By default, they are rendered with

both the key and value. You can only render the value using parenthesis instead: `(key:: value)`. You can disable

this feature in the configuration.

Full-line inline fields (that Dataview has supported for a long time) will gain similar rendering support soon; in the

meanwhile, give the new syntax a try!

### Task Linking

Tasks now render with a link to the page/section that they are defined in, making `GROUP BY` and custom task

editing easier to do:

* A Task. 🔗
* Another Task. 🔗
  + Some Random Subtask. 🔗

You can configure the symbol for the link or disable it alltogether.

### Improving DataviewJS Posture

I am currently actively looking into improving DataviewJS sandboxing and general security posture. As a first small step

in this, I have made DataviewJS opt-in instead of opt-out, and added a separate control for Inline DataviewJS. You may

need to re-enable it in your settings if you use it.

More improvements and better JavaScript sandboxing will follow.
