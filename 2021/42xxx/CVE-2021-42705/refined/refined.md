Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42705:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability. This occurs when the software writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-121:** Stack-based Buffer Overflow. This vulnerability allows an attacker to write data past the boundaries of a stack buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   Successful exploitation of this vulnerability may allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector involves processing specially crafted project files by the vulnerable PLC Editor.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have the ability to provide a malicious project file to the PLC Editor software for processing. This suggests the user needs to open a malicious file.
*   The vulnerability is described as having a low attack complexity.
*   The attack is not exploitable remotely. It requires local access to the system running the vulnerable software.
*   The user interaction is required (UI:R) as the user has to open the malicious file.

**Additional Details:**

*   The affected product is WECON PLC Editor versions 1.3.8 and prior.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Natnael Samson (@NattiSamson), working with Trend Microâ€™s Zero Day Initiative.
*   WECON has not responded to requests to work with CISA to mitigate these vulnerabilities.
*   The CVSS v3 base score is 7.8 with the vector string (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) indicating local access, low complexity, no privileges required, user interaction required, no scope change, high confidentiality impact, high integrity impact and high availability impact.

It should be noted that CVE-2021-42707, an out-of-bounds write vulnerability, was also identified in the same advisory with the same CVSS v3 score and vector string.
