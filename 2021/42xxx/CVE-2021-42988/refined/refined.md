This content provides information about CVE-2021-42988, among other CVEs related to the Eltima SDK and its usage in various cloud services.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a set of vulnerabilities in the Eltima SDK's USB-over-Ethernet functionality, specifically within the `wspvuhub.sys` and `wspusbfilter.sys` drivers. These drivers improperly handle I/O control (IOCTL) requests, particularly with IOCTL codes `0x22005B` and `0x22001B`, which use `METHOD_NEITHER` for data transfer. This method does not validate user-supplied buffer sizes, allowing for potential integer overflows during memory allocation and copy operations within the kernel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Integer overflow:  Insecure arithmetic operations on user-controlled data when calculating the `memmove` size parameter, without any overflow checks.
- Lack of input validation: The IOCTL handlers fail to properly validate user-supplied buffer sizes, leading to out-of-bounds memory access during allocation and copy operations.
- Incorrect usage of `METHOD_NEITHER`: The drivers do not handle the `METHOD_NEITHER` buffer correctly by not validating, probing, locking, and mapping the buffer itself.
- Missing access control: The driver accepts IOCTLs without proper access control list (ACL) enforcement, meaning any user process can potentially send the malformed IRP.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Attackers can escalate their privileges to kernel mode by exploiting the vulnerabilities.
- Arbitrary code execution: This allows attackers to execute arbitrary code in kernel mode, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
- Bypass of security products: With kernel-level access, attackers can disable or bypass security products running on the system.
- System corruption: Exploitation can corrupt the operating system, leading to system instability or denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious IOCTL requests: Sending crafted IRPs to the vulnerable driver using the IOCTL codes 0x22005B and 0x22001B.
- Local privilege escalation: A local user can exploit the vulnerability to gain system privileges.
- Potential for sandbox escape: Due to the lack of ACL, the vulnerability might be exploited from sandboxes.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute code on the target system, which can be a local user or a malicious process.
- Ability to send DeviceIoControl requests to the vulnerable driver.
