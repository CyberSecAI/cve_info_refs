{
  "CVE-2021-42715": {
    "Root cause of vulnerability": "The HDR loader in stb_image parsed truncated end-of-file RLE scanlines as an infinite sequence of zero-length runs.",
    "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Infinite loop in the RLE decoder, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability.",
    "Impact of exploitation": "Denial of service. An attacker could cause an application using stb_image to enter an infinite loop, making the application unresponsive.",
    "Attack vectors": "A specially crafted HDR image file can trigger the infinite loop when loaded by an application using stb_image.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted HDR image file to be loaded by a vulnerable application."
