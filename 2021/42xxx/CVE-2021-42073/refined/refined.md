    "CVE-2021-42073": {
        "Description": "An issue was discovered in Barrier before 2.4.0. An attacker can enter an active session state with the barriers component (aka the server-side implementation of Barrier) simply by supplying a client label that identifies a valid client configuration. This label is \"Unnamed\" by default but could instead be guessed from hostnames or other publicly available information. In the active session state, an attacker can capture input device events from the server, and also modify the clipboard content on the server.",
        "Root cause of vulnerability": "The server does not properly verify the identity of connecting clients. It relies solely on a client name string which is set on the server, to authorize the connection. This name can be easily guessed or obtained.",
        "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
            "Insufficient client authentication.",
             "Reliance on a simple string label for access control."
        ],
        "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can gain control of the server's input devices and clipboard, enabling them to capture input device events and modify clipboard content.",
        "Attack vectors": "Network-based attacks where the attacker is on the same network as the Barrier server.",
         "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to be on the same network as the Barrier server and know or guess the name of a configured client to establish a connection. No prior authentication is required, just knowledge of a valid client name which is \"Unnamed\" by default and often unchanged by users."
