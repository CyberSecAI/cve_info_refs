{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability exists within the Microsoft Diagnostics Hub Standard Collector Service due to improper handling of symbolic links.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The service can be abused by creating a symbolic link, allowing an attacker to delete an arbitrary directory.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in the context of SYSTEM.",
  "Attack vectors": "Local attacker must first have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system and the ability to create symbolic links."
