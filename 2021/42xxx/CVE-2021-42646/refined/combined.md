### @hisanhunais **[hisanhunais](/hisanhunais)** commented [Apr 12, 2021](#issue-855530269)

### Proposed changes in this pull request

* Creating a secure parser for Unmarshalling Service Provider File Content

### Approach

1. Introduced a secure SAXParserFactory
2. Parsed the contained through the SAXParserFactor and generated a source object
3. Perform unmarshall operation by passing the generated source object to the unmarshaller
