Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-42028:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the affected application, *syngo fastView*, lacking proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing BMP files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write: The improper validation during BMP file parsing can lead to an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated memory structure.
- CWE-787: The vulnerability is classified as CWE-787, which is an out-of-bounds write.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution: An attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code within the context of the current process.
- Application crash: Triggering the vulnerability could also lead to a crash of the *syngo fastView* application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious file: An attacker can create a specially crafted malicious BMP file.
- User interaction: The attack requires a user to open the malicious BMP file using *syngo fastView*.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to deliver the malicious BMP file to the user.
- The attacker needs to trick the user into opening the malicious file.
- The attacker does not need to have any prior privileges on the system.

**Additional Details:**
- The advisory states that no remediation is currently planned for this vulnerability.
- The CVSS v3.1 base score is 7.8, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:U/RC:C, indicating a local attack vector, low attack complexity, no privileges required, user interaction required, no scope change, with high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact. The exploit is also considered proof of concept level.
- The advisory provides mitigations such as downloading *syngo* fastView only from official sources, avoiding opening untrusted files, and removing the application after viewing necessary files.
