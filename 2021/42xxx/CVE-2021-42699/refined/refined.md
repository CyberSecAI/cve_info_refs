Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-42699:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application transmits cookie information in cleartext over HTTP.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319).

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can capture network traffic, obtain the user's cookie, and take over the account. This allows for unauthorized access to user information.

**Attack Vectors:** Network traffic capture via a man-in-the-middle (MiTM) attack is mentioned implicitly.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic, which can be achieved if they are on the same network as the victim, or if they can perform a network level attack (like ARP spoofing). The attacker must have a privileged position on the network to capture the cookie in transit. They also need to be a low-privileged user. The attack requires user interaction since the user needs to use the application.

**Additional Details:**
- This vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 5.7 with a vector of (AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:N/A:N)
- The affected product is DAQFactory, specifically all versions 18.1 Build 2347 and prior
