The content is related to CVE-2021-42324.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input validation in the `capture` command, which is used to record network traffic via `tcpdump` on DCN S4600-10P-SI switches. User-supplied parameters are directly concatenated into a system command without sanitization, leading to command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Metacharacter Injection (OS Command Injection): The `capture` command passes user-provided parameters directly to the system shell without proper sanitization. Metacharacters like `;`, `&`, backticks `` ` ``, and `$( )` can be injected to execute arbitrary commands.
- Lack of Input Validation: The system fails to validate and sanitize user-supplied input before passing it to the underlying shell. This allows attackers to manipulate command syntax and execute malicious commands.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Code Execution: By injecting metacharacters and commands, an attacker can execute arbitrary code with root privileges on the switch's operating system.
- System Compromise: Successful exploitation leads to complete control over the affected switch, enabling attackers to perform unauthorized actions, alter configurations, and potentially disrupt network operations.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs access to the switch's command-line interface (CLI) or shell.
- Low Privilege Access: The vulnerability can be exploited even by users with the lowest privileges on the switch.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Access to the switch's command-line interface (CLI)
- Ability to use the `capture` command
- Basic knowledge of shell metacharacters and command syntax
