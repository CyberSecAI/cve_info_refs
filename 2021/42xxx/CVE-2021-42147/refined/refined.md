Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42147:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A buffer over-read exists in the `dtls_sha256_update` function within the TinyDTLS library. This occurs because the server does not properly validate the fragment length field of incoming DTLS packets.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Buffer over-read in `dtls_sha256_update`.
- Improper handling of malformed packets by DTLS servers.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The vulnerability can cause a crash of the DTLS server.
- Potential information disclosure: Attackers might be able to read sensitive information from memory due to the over-read.
- Possible code execution

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability by sending a specially crafted, malformed DTLS packet.
- The malformed packet must include an over-large fragment length field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network packets to a vulnerable DTLS server.
- No special privileges are mentioned as a requirement.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected product is Contiki-NG TinyDTLS, specifically the master branch up to commit 53a0d97.
- The vulnerability was discovered by "jerrytesting."
- A reference link to the issue on the project's GitHub is provided.
