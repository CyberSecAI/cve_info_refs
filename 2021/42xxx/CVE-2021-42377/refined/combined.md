![Unboxing BusyBox: 14 Vulnerabilities Uncovered by Claroty, JFrog](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy82MzI3NDc1OWM0MDI1YWU5ZjgwMzI3MDYzZWNkNzY1YS1idXN5Ym94LWFsdC5wbmc=/63274759c4025ae9f80327063ecd765a-busybox-alt.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&w=800&h=450&s=e05200da22c28a633e9abd3c3d513b78)

## Executive Summary

* Team82 and researchers from JFrog collaborated to research the security of BusyBox, a suite of Linux utilities used in IT use cases, as well as OT and IoT
* Many popular PLCs, HMIs, and RTUs run on Linux and have BusyBox utilities running under the hood.
* Our combined research uncovered 14 vulnerabilities affecting current versions of BusyBox, which was updated in version 1.34.0
* Most of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to disrupt services, causing a denial of service condition.
* In some cases, information leaks or remote code execution is possible.
* As part of this research, Team82 is making freely available the [custom AFL fuzzing harnesses](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing) used in this research.

## What is BusyBox?

Embedded devices with limited memory and storage resources are likely to leverage a tool such as [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/), which is marketed as the Swiss Army Knife of embedded Linux. BusyBox is a software suite of many useful Unix utilities, known as applets, that are packaged as a single executable file. Within BusyBox you can find a full fledged shell, a DHCP client/server, and small utilities such as cp, ls, grep, and others. You're also likely to find many OT and IoT devices running BusyBox, including popular programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and remote terminal units (RTUs)—many of which now run on Linux.

As part of our commitment to [improving open-source software security](https://www.wwnytv.com/prnewswire/2021/10/13/entry-level-kubernetes-certification-help-advance-cloud-careers/), Claroty's Team82 and JFrog collaborated on a vulnerability research project examining BusyBox. Using static and dynamic techniques, Claroty's Team82 and JFrog discovered 14 vulnerabilities affecting the latest version of BusyBox. All vulnerabilities were privately disclosed and fixed by BusyBox in [version 1.34.0, which was released Aug. 19](https://busybox.net/).

In most cases, the expected impact of these issues is denial of service (DoS). However, in rarer cases, these issues can also lead to information leaks and possibly remote code execution.

In this report, we will provide details about the vulnerabilities, elaborate on who is affected, discuss our research methodology, explain one of the vulnerabilities in depth, and suggest fixes and workarounds for these issues.

In addition to disclosing the vulnerabilities, Team82 is also open-sourcing its [custom AFL fuzzing harnesses](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing), which were responsible for triggering many of the mentioned vulnerabilities. Hopefully this will help fellow researchers find and disclose even more issues.

## Discovered Vulnerabilities in BusyBox

![BusyBox Discovered Vulnerabilities](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9lMmMwNmRjYTU2MTUyNGM0YTA4YWZkYzUzYWM5YTg1MS1CdXN5Qm94X1RhYmxlLTEtOTgzeDEwMjQuanBn/e2c06dca561524c4a08afdc53ac9a851-BusyBox_Table-1-983x1024.jpg?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=3e25f1f3314d5109764230141d604b37)
### Triggering the Vulnerabilities

Since the affected applets are not daemons, each vulnerability can only be exploited if the vulnerable applet is fed with untrusted data (usually through a command-line argument). Specifically, these are the conditions that must occur for each vulnerability to be triggered:

#### [CVE-2021-42373:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42373)

Applies if the attacker can control all parameters passed to man.
man is built by the default BusyBox configuration, but not shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42374:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42374)

Applies if the attacker can supply a crafted compressed file, that will be decompressed by using unlzma.
Note that even if the unlzma applet is not available, but CONFIG\_FEATURE\_SEAMLESS\_LZMA (enabled by default) is enabled, other applets such as tar, unzip, rpm, dpkg,lzma and man can also reach the vulnerable code when handling a file with the .lzma filename suffix.
unlzma is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42375:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42375)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to ash that contains the special characters $, {, }, or # .
ash is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42376:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42376)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to hush that contains the special character \x03 (delimiter).
hush is built by the default BusyBox configuration, but not shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42377:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42377)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to hush that contains the special character &.

#### [CVE-2021-42378](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42378), [CVE-2021-42386:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42386)

Applies if the attacker can supply an arbitrary pattern to awk (the pattern is the first positional argument this applet takes).
awk is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

## Research Methodology

To research BusyBox, we used static and dynamic analysis approaches.

First, a manual review of the BusyBox source code was conducted in a top-down approach (following user input up to specific applet handling). We also looked for obvious logical/memory corruption vulnerabilities.

The next approach was fuzzing. We compiled BusyBox with [ASan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer) and implemented an [AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL) harness for each BusyBox applet. Each harness was subsequently optimized by removing unnecessary parts of the code, running multiple fuzzing cycles on the same process [(persistent mode)](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2015/06/new-in-afl-persistent-mode.html), and running multiple fuzzed instances in parallel.

We started from fuzzing all the daemon applets, including HTTP, Telnet, DNS, DHCP, NTP etc. Many code changes were required in order to effectively fuzz network-based input. For example, the main modification we performed was to replace all recv functions with input from STDIN in order to support fuzzed inputs. Similar changes were done when we fuzzed non-server applets as well.

We prepared a couple of examples for each applet and ran hundreds of fuzzed BusyBox instances for a few days. This gave us tens of thousands of crashes to evaluate. We had to create classes of crashes with the same root cause to help reduce the volume of crashes we had in our sample set. Later, we minimized each group representative in order to work with a small subset of unique crash inputs.

To fulfill these tasks, we developed automatic tooling that digested all crash data and classified it based on the crash analysis report which mainly includes the crash stack trace, registers, and assembly code of the relevant code area. For example, we merged cases with similar crash stack traces because they usually had the same problematic root cause.

Finally, we researched each unique crash and minimized its input vector in order to understand the root cause, which allowed us to create a proof-of-concept (PoC) that exploits the vulnerability responsible for the crash. In addition, we tested our PoCs against several BusyBox versions to understand when the bugs were introduced to the source code.

**To summarize, here are the steps we took in our research:**

1. Code Review
2. Fuzzing
3. Reduction and Minimization
4. Triage
5. Proof of Concept
6. Testing Multiple Versions
7. Disclosure

## Guide, Resources for BusyBox Fuzzing

As part of our commitment to the OSS and security communities, we created a simple on-boarding guide detailing how to fuzz BusyBox. The guide is published alongside all of the fuzzing harnesses we wrote as part of our fuzzing efforts. We hope these fuzzing harnesses can be further improved by the community, in order to find and fix even more bugs in BusyBox.

**All materials are available on [Claroty's GitHub page](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing).**

## Threat Analysis

To assess the threat level posed by these vulnerabilities, we inspected JFrog's database of more than 10,000 embedded firmware images (comprised of only publicly available firmware, and not images uploaded to JFrog's Artifactory). We found that 40% of them contained a BusyBox executable file that is linked with one of the affected applets, making these issues extremely widespread among Linux-based embedded firmware.

However, we believe these issues do not currently pose a critical security threat because:

1. While the DoS vulnerabilities are trivial to exploit, the impact is usually mitigated by the fact that applets almost always run as a separate forked process.
2. The information leak vulnerability is nontrivial to exploit (see, next section).
3. The use-after-free vulnerabilities may be exploitable for remote code execution, but currently we did not attempt to create a weaponized exploit for them. In addition, it is quite rare (and inherently unsafe) to process an awk pattern from external input.

## Deep Dive: [CVE-2021-42374](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42374): LZMA OOB Read

### Lempel-Ziv-Markov Chain Algorithm (LZMA) and Range Coding

[LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm) is a compression algorithm that uses dictionary compression, and encodes its output using a range encoder. The dictionary compressor finds matches using sophisticated dictionary data structures, and produces a stream of literal symbols and phrase references, which are encoded one bit at a time by the range encoder, using a complex model to make a probability prediction of each bit.

The compression algorithm encodes the compressed stream as a stream of bits using an adaptive binary range coder. Data is broken into packets, where each packet describes either a single byte, or an LZ77 sequence, with its length and distance implicitly or explicitly encoded.

The .lzma format, below, consists of a 13-byte header followed by the LZMA compressed data. Here is a small example of compressing the string "abc" using LZMA:

In order to output the decompressed stream, LZMA implementations use a memory buffer that is initialized in the size of the user-provided dictionary size (part of the LZMA header). Once that buffer is filled, it automatically outputs the data thus far, flushes the buffer and starts filling it up again.

## The Vulnerability

The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient size check, below, in the function decompress\_unlzma.c (at line 295) when the state >= LZMA\_NUM\_LIT\_STATES:

![BusyBox Screen](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy83MmZiNWFlZDJjMTE3NjUyYjRjNzU0YmRiNzFlODUxZi1CdXN5Ym94U2NyZWVuLVNob3QxLnBuZw==/72fb5aed2c117652b4c754bdb71e851f-BusyboxScreen-Shot1.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=871614b4e1d8ca01181f87fd19d71b0b)

To trigger the vulnerability and to control the starting offset where we will leak data from, we need to make sure that the following conditions are satisfied:

buffer\_pos = 0
and
rep0 = offset + dict\_size

This way, pos will be equal to -(offset + dict\_size). After adding dict\_size, pos will be -offset and so we could leak memory from our desired offset through match\_byte. The leaked memory will most likely contain pointers which could further assist attackers in their exploitation campaign (ex. by facilitating ASLR bypass).

## Causing an Out-of-Bounds Access

The general idea to exploit this vulnerability is to prepare a specifically crafted LZMA encoded stream, so that when it is decoded, both conditions will be filled and pos will be equal to a negative number -offset. Eventually, the decompressed stream will contain the leaked memory, which will be written to the output steam.

To satisfy the first condition buffer\_pos = 0, we need to make sure our code flow (state >= LZMA\_NUM\_LIT\_STATES) is reached right after the current decompressed buffer stream is flushed and so the buffer pointer position will be 0. We can achieve this by reaching the last iteration, below, of a current match:

![BusyBox Buffer Screen](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy80NDRkMjA2YjNkYWYzYzY2MDgxMTU5OTZlODMwODk5MS1CdXN5Ym94LXNjcmVlbnNob3QyLnBuZw==/444d206b3daf3c6608115996e8308991-Busybox-screenshot2.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=6a65d75f65861c4938c240f7b32a72c4)

The second condition is more difficult to satisfy and requires intimate knowledge of how the LZMA algorithm works. The general idea is to encode a special length in the LZMA bit stream so that when decoded it will be used by the rep0 variable.

To conclude, in order to reach an OOB condition, we need to write some bytes, then use a match to fill the buffer to header.dict\_size and change rep0 to our desired value. Therefore, pos will be equal -offset and we could leak bytes from offset as a reference to the buffer pointer.

## Leaking Bits from Out-of-Bounds Memory

After reading the match\_byte, we will get to this flow, below:

![BusyBox Vulnerability](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9lMjVkYmMwMWRlMmQ0NWYzOWRmNzZmZDMzN2EyMGJjZi1CdXN5Ym94LXNjcmVlbnNob3QzLnBuZw==/e25dbc01de2d45f39df76fd337a20bcf-Busybox-screenshot3.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ee3df1ca72ffcf74de23e3bcdd84f164)

As long as the bits match our match\_byte (the leaked byte), it will be in the loop that reads the probability from prob + 0x100 + bit + mi, but once one bit is not matched, it reads it from prob + mi. We can detect what was the first unmatched bit, by checking if prob + mi was changed by writing more literal bytes, or if the probability was changed and we got a different output. Finally, the leaked bits will get flushed to the decompressed buffer.

## Weaponizing ZIP Files

Although the vulnerability was found in the LZMA decompression algorithm, we found that many applets support an LZMA compression and will try to decompress encoded LZMA streams by default (see section, "Fixes and Workarounds" for the configuration flags governing this behavior). For example, the ubiquitous ZIP format supports LZMA compression as a "type 14" compression.

From an attacker's perspective, ZIP is a much better attack vector because:

* unzip invocations are much more common than direct invocations of unlzma.
* With this attack vector, there are no constraints on the filename that's going to be unzipped (unlike in the tar attack vector, which requires a .lzma suffix).
* The leaked data can be extracted and saved into files that can be later read remotely. For example, this can happen in an embedded web service that permits uploading zip files with media resources, which will get extracted to an accessible location. From there, the attacker could read the leaked memory data.

To test this, we built a small PoC script that generates a weaponized ZIP where one of the files is compressed using LZMA, below:

![Segmentation Fault](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9kYmVlYWE5ZDg4MTc2NTA5YjgwZmZmZTA4MzVhOGM3Yi1MWk1BY29kZS0xMDI0eDUyMS5wbmc=/dbeeaa9d88176509b80fffe0835a8c7b-LZMAcode-1024x521.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ae2d5c26a57ff37701b0b4a42298b9fe)
## Fixes and Workarounds

All 14 vulnerabilities have been fixed in BusyBox 1.34.0 ([direct download link](https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.34.0.tar.bz2)) and users are urged to upgrade.

If upgrading BusyBox is not possible (due to specific version compatibility needs), BusyBox 1.33.1 and earlier versions can be compiled without the vulnerable functionality (applets) as a workaround.

After running make deconfig in BusyBox's source directory (or if reusing a previous configuration), edit the .config file such as:

* man - Comment out CONFIG\_MAN=y
* lzma - Comment out CONFIG\_UNLZMA=y , CONFIG\_FEATURE\_SEAMLESS\_LZMA=y and CONFIG\_FEATURE\_UNZIP\_LZMA=y
* ash - Comment out CONFIG\_ASH=y
* hush - Comment out CONFIG\_HUSH=y
* awk - Comment out CONFIG\_AWK=y

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Denys Vlasenko from BusyBox's development team for validating and fixing all of the above issues in a swift manner for [version 1.34.0](https://busybox.net/).

A **Unix shell** is a [command-line interpreter](/wiki/Command-line_interface#Command-line_interpreter "Command-line interface") or [shell](/wiki/Shell_%28computing%29 "Shell (computing)") that provides a command line [user interface](/wiki/User_interface "User interface") for [Unix-like](/wiki/Unix-like "Unix-like") [operating systems](/wiki/Operating_system "Operating system"). The shell is both an interactive [command language](/wiki/Command_language "Command language") and a [scripting language](/wiki/Scripting_language "Scripting language"), and is used by the operating system to control the execution of the system using [shell scripts](/wiki/Shell_script "Shell script").[[2]](#cite_note-2)

Users typically interact with a Unix shell using a [terminal emulator](/wiki/Terminal_emulator "Terminal emulator"); however, direct operation via serial hardware connections or [Secure Shell](/wiki/Secure_Shell "Secure Shell") are common for server systems. All Unix shells provide filename [wildcarding](/wiki/Wildcard_character "Wildcard character"), [piping](/wiki/Pipeline_%28Unix%29 "Pipeline (Unix)"), [here documents](/wiki/Here_document "Here document"), [command substitution](/wiki/Command_substitution "Command substitution"), [variables](/wiki/Variable_%28programming%29 "Variable (programming)") and [control structures](/wiki/Control_flow "Control flow") for [condition-testing](/wiki/Conditional_%28programming%29 "Conditional (programming)") and [iteration](/wiki/Iteration "Iteration").

## Concept

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Unix_shell&action=edit&section=1 "Edit section: Concept")]

Generally, a *shell* is a program that executes other programs in response to text commands. A sophisticated shell can also change the environment in which other programs execute by passing [named variables](/wiki/Environment_variable "Environment variable"), a parameter list, or an input source.

In Unix-like operating systems, users typically have many choices of command-line interpreters for interactive sessions. When a user [logs into](/wiki/Log_in "Log in") the system interactively, a shell program is automatically executed for the duration of the session. The type of shell, which may be customized for each user, is typically stored in the user's profile, for example in the local [passwd](/wiki/Passwd_%28file%29 "Passwd (file)") file or in a distributed configuration system such as [NIS](/wiki/Network_Information_Service "Network Information Service") or [LDAP](/wiki/Lightweight_Directory_Access_Protocol "Lightweight Directory Access Protocol"); however, the user may execute any other available shell interactively.

On operating systems with a [windowing system](/wiki/Windowing_system "Windowing system"), such as [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") and desktop [Linux distributions](/wiki/Linux_distribution "Linux distribution"), some users may never use the shell directly. On Unix systems, the shell has historically been the implementation language of system startup scripts, including the program that starts a windowing system, configures networking, and many other essential functions. However, some system vendors have replaced the traditional shell-based startup system ([init](/wiki/Init "Init")) with different approaches, such as [systemd](/wiki/Systemd "Systemd").

## Early shells

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Unix_shell&action=edit&section=2 "Edit section: Early shells")]

The first Unix shell was the [Thompson shell](/wiki/Thompson_shell "Thompson shell"), *sh*, written by [Ken Thompson](/wiki/Ken_Thompson_%28computer_programmer%29 "Ken Thompson (computer programmer)") at [Bell Labs](/wiki/Bell_Labs "Bell Labs") and distributed with Versions 1 through 6 of Unix, from 1971 to 1975.[[3]](#cite_note-v6hist-3) Though rudimentary by modern standards, it introduced many of the basic features common to all later Unix shells, including piping, simple control structures using `if` and `goto`, and filename wildcarding. Though not in current use, it is still available as part of some [Ancient UNIX](/wiki/Ancient_UNIX "Ancient UNIX") systems.

It was modeled after the [Multics](/wiki/Multics "Multics") shell, developed in 1965 by American software engineer [Glenda Schroeder](/wiki/Glenda_Schroeder "Glenda Schroeder"). Schroeder's Multics shell was itself modeled after the [RUNCOM](/wiki/RUNCOM "RUNCOM") program [Louis Pouzin](/wiki/Louis_Pouzin "Louis Pouzin") showed to the Multics Team. The "rc" suffix on some Unix configuration files (for example, ".vimrc"), is a remnant of the RUNCOM ancestry of Unix shells.[[1]](#cite_note-Vleck-1)[[4]](#cite_note-Pouzin-4)

The [PWB shell](/wiki/PWB_shell "PWB shell") or Mashey shell, *sh*, was an upward-compatible version of the Thompson shell, augmented by [John Mashey](/wiki/John_Mashey "John Mashey") and others and distributed with the [Programmer's Workbench UNIX](/wiki/PWB/UNIX "PWB/UNIX"), circa 1975–1977. It focused on making shell programming practical, especially in large shared computing centers. It added shell variables (precursors of [environment variables](/wiki/Environment_variable "Environment variable"), including the search path mechanism that evolved into $PATH), user-executable shell scripts, and interrupt-handling. Control structures were extended from if/goto to if/then/else/endif, switch/breaksw/endsw, and while/end/break/continue. As shell programming became widespread, these external commands were incorporated into the shell itself for performance.

But the most widely distributed and influential of the early Unix shells were the [Bourne shell](/wiki/Bourne_shell "Bourne shell") and the [C shell](/wiki/C_shell "C shell"). Both shells have been used as the coding base and model for many derivative and work-alike shells with extended feature sets.[[5]](#cite_note-5)

### Bourne shell

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Unix_shell&action=edit&section=3 "Edit section: Bourne shell")]

The [Bourne shell](/wiki/Bourne_shell "Bourne shell"), *sh*, was a new Unix shell by [Stephen Bourne](/wiki/Stephen_R._Bourne "Stephen R. Bourne") at Bell Labs.[[6]](#cite_note-6) Distributed as the shell for UNIX Version 7 in 1979, it introduced the rest of the basic features considered common to all the later Unix shells, including [here documents](/wiki/Here_document "Here document"), [command substitution](/wiki/Command_substitution "Command substitution"), more generic [variables](/wiki/Variable_%28programming%29 "Variable (programming)") and more extensive builtin [control structures](/wiki/Control_flow "Control flow"). The language, including the use of a reversed keyword to mark the end of a block, was influenced by [ALGOL 68](/wiki/ALGOL_68 "ALGOL 68").[[7]](#cite_note-7) Traditionally, the Bourne shell program name is sh and its path in the Unix file system hierarchy is /bin/sh. But a number of compatible work-alikes are also available with various improvements and additional features. On many systems, sh may be a [symbolic link](/wiki/Symbolic_link "Symbolic link") or [hard link](/wiki/Hard_link "Hard link") to one of these alternatives:

* [Almquist shell](/wiki/Almquist_shell "Almquist shell") (ash): written as a BSD-licensed replacement for the Bourne Shell; often used in resource-constrained environments. The sh of [FreeBSD](/wiki/FreeBSD "FreeBSD"), [NetBSD](/wiki/NetBSD "NetBSD") (and their derivatives) are based on ash that has been enhanced to be [POSIX](/wiki/POSIX "POSIX") conformant.
  + [Busybox](/wiki/Busybox "Busybox"): a set of Unix utilities for small and embedded systems, which includes 2 shells: ash, a derivative of the Almquist shell; and hush, an independent implementation of a Bourne shell.
  + [Debian Almquist shell](/wiki/Debian_Almquist_shell "Debian Almquist shell") (dash): a modern replacement for ash in [Debian](/wiki/Debian "Debian") and [Ubuntu](/wiki/Ubuntu_%28operating_system%29 "Ubuntu (operating system)")
* [Bourne-Again shell](/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29 "Bash (Unix shell)") (bash): written as part of the [GNU Project](/wiki/GNU_Project "GNU Project") to provide a superset of Bourne Shell functionality. This shell can be found installed and is the default interactive shell for users on most [Linux](/wiki/Linux "Linux") systems.
* [KornShell](/wiki/KornShell "KornShell") (ksh): written by [David Korn](/wiki/David_Korn_%28computer_scientist%29 "David Korn (computer scientist)") based on the Bourne shell sources[[8]](#cite_note-8) while working at [Bell Labs](/wiki/Bell_Labs "Bell Labs")
* [Public domain Korn shell](/wiki/Pdksh "Pdksh") (pdksh)
  + [MirBSD Korn shell](/wiki/Mksh "Mksh") (mksh): a descendant of the [OpenBSD](/wiki/OpenBSD "OpenBSD") /bin/ksh and pdksh, developed as part of [MirOS BSD](/wiki/MirOS_BSD "MirOS BSD")
* [Z shell](/wiki/Z_shell "Z shell") (zsh): a relatively modern shell that is [backward compatible](/wiki/Backward_compatible "Backward compatible") with [bash](/wiki/Bash_%28Unix_shell%29 "Bash (Unix shell)"). It's the default shell in [Kali Linux](/wiki/Kali_Linux "Kali Linux") since 2020.4 and [macOS](/wiki/MacOS "MacOS") since 10.15 [Catalina](/wiki/MacOS_Catalina "MacOS Catalina").

The [POSIX](/wiki/POSIX "POSIX") standard specifies its standard shell as a strict subset of the [Korn shell](/wiki/KornShell "KornShell"), an enhanced version of the Bourne shell. From a user's perspective the Bourne shell was immediately recognized when active by its characteristic default command line prompt character, the dollar sign ($).

### C shell

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Unix_shell&action=edit&section=4 "Edit section: C shell")]

The [C shell](/wiki/C_shell "C shell"), *csh*, was modeled on the C programming language, including the control structures and the expression grammar. It was written by [Bill Joy](/wiki/Bill_Joy "Bill Joy") as a graduate student at [University of California, Berkeley](/wiki/University_of_California%2C_Berkeley "University of California, Berkeley"), and was widely distributed with [BSD Unix](/wiki/Berkeley_Software_Distribution "Berkeley Software Distribution").[[9]](#cite_note-9)[*[better source needed](/wiki/Wikipedia%3ANOTRS "Wikipedia:NOTRS")*]

The C shell also introduced many features for interactive work, including the [history](/wiki/C_shell#History "C shell") and [editing](/wiki/C_shell#Editing_operators "C shell") mechanisms, [aliases](/wiki/C_shell#Aliases "C shell"), [directory stacks](/wiki/C_shell#Directory_stack "C shell"), [tilde notation](/wiki/C_shell#Tilde_notation "C shell"), [cdpath](/wiki/C_shell#Cdpath "C shell"), [job control](/wiki/C_shell#Job_control "C shell") and [path hashing](/wiki/C_shell#Path_hashing "C shell"). On many systems, csh may be a [symbolic link](/wiki/Symbolic_link "Symbolic link") or [hard link](/wiki/Hard_link "Hard link") to [TENEX C shell](/wiki/TENEX_C_shell "TENEX C shell") (tcsh), an improved version of Joy's original version. Although the interactive features of csh have been copied to most other shells, the language structure has not been widely copied. The only work-alike is [Hamilton C shell](/wiki/Hamilton_C_shell "Hamilton C shell"), written by Nicole Hamilton, first distributed on [OS/2](/wiki/OS/2 "OS/2") in 1988 and on [Windows](/wiki/Windows "Windows") since 1992.[[10]](#cite_note-10)

## Configuration files

[[edit](/w/index.php?title=Unix_shell&action=edit&section=5 "Edit section: Configuration files")]

Shells read configuration files in various circumstances. These files usually contain commands for the shell and are executed when loaded; they are usually used to set important variables used to find executables, like [$PATH](/wiki/%24PATH "$PATH"), and others that control the behavior and appearance of the shell. The table in this section shows the configuration files for popular shells.[[11]](#cite_note-11)

Explanation:

* blank means a file is not read by a shell at all.
* "yes" means a file is always read by a shell upon startup.
* "login" means a file is read if the shell is a login shell.
* "n/login" means a file is read if the shell is not a login shell.
* "int." means a file is read if the shell is interactive.

1. **[^](#cite_ref-12)** only if ~/.tcshrc not found
2. **[^](#cite_ref-13)** Newer versions of the Bourne Shell only
3. **[^](#cite_ref-16)** Available on systems that support the "User Portability Utilities option"; value of the variable must be an *absolute* path, and it is ignored "if the user's real and effective user IDs or real and effective group IDs are different."[[13]](#cite_note-15)
4. **[^](#cite_ref-17)** $ENV is $HOME/.shrc in newer versions of the Bourne Shell
5. **[^](#cite_ref-19)** Same behavior as sh, but only if invoked as sh (bash 2+) or, since bash 4.2, also if invoked *explicitly* in POSIX compatibility mode (with options --posix or -o posix).[[14]](#cite_note-18)
6. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-zsh_profiles_20-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-zsh_profiles_20-1) Only in sh/ksh compatibility mode (when invoked as bash, sh, ksh)
7. ^ [***a***](#cite_ref-bash_profiles_21-0) [***b***](#cite_ref-bash_profiles_21-1) [***c***](#cite_ref-bash_profiles_21-2) The first readable file in order of ~/.bash\_profile, ~/.bash\_login and ~/.profile; and only ~/.profile if invoked as sh or, as of at least Bash 4.2, if invoked *explicitly* in POSIX compatibility mode (with options --posix or -o posix)

## Background

Embedded devices with limited memory and storage resources are likely to leverage a tool such as [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/), which is marketed as the Swiss Army Knife of embedded Linux. BusyBox is a software suite of many useful Unix utilities, known as applets, that are packaged as a single executable file. Within BusyBox you can find a full-fledged shell, a DHCP client/server, and small utilities such as `cp`, `ls`, `grep`, and others. You’re likely to find many OT and IoT devices running BusyBox, including popular programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and remote terminal units (RTUs)—many of which now run on Linux.

As part of our commitment to [improving open-source software security,](https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/open-source-security-foundation-raises-10-million-in-new-commitments-to-secure-software-supply-chains-301399530.html) Claroty’s Team82 and JFrog collaborated on a vulnerability research project examining BusyBox. Using static and dynamic techniques, Claroty’s Team82 and JFrog discovered 14 vulnerabilities affecting the latest version of BusyBox. All vulnerabilities were privately disclosed and fixed by BusyBox in version 1.34.0, which was [released Aug. 19](https://busybox.net/).

In most cases, the expected impact of these issues is denial of service (DoS). However, in rarer cases, these issues can also lead to information leaks and possibly remote code execution.

In this report, we provide details on the vulnerabilities we discovered, elaborate on who is affected, discuss our research methodology, explain one of the vulnerabilities in depth, and suggest fixes and workarounds for these issues.

In addition to disclosing the vulnerabilities, Team82 is also [open-sourcing](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing) our custom AFL fuzzing harnesses, which were responsible for triggering many of the mentioned vulnerabilities. Hopefully this will help fellow researchers find and disclose more issues.

## The Vulnerabilities

| **CVE ID** | **Description** | **Affected applet** | **Affected versions (inclusive)** | **Impact** | **CVSS v3.1** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **CVE-2021-42373** | A NULL pointer dereference in `man` leads to denial of service when a section name is supplied but no page argument is given | `man` | 1.33.0-1.33.1 | DoS | [5.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) |
| **CVE-2021-42374** | An out-of-bounds heap read in `unlzma` leads to information leak and denial of service when crafted LZMA-compressed input is decompressed. This can be triggered by any applet/format that internally supports LZMA compression. | `lzma`/`unlzma` and more (see below) | 1.27.0 – 1.33.1 | DoS & InfoLeak | [6.5](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:H) |
| **CVE-2021-42375** | An incorrect handling of a special element in `ash` leads to denial of service when processing a crafted shell command, due to the shell mistaking specific characters for reserved characters. This may be used for DoS under rare conditions of filtered command input. | `ash` | 1.33.1 | DoS | [4.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) |
| **CVE-2021-42376** | A NULL pointer dereference in `hush` leads to denial of service when processing a crafted shell command, due to missing validation after a \x03 delimiter character. This may be used for DoS under very rare conditions of filtered command input. | `hush` | 1.16-1.31.1 | DoS | [4.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) |
| **CVE-2021-42377** | An attacker-controlled pointer free in `hush` leads to denial of service and possible code execution when processing a crafted shell command, due to the shell mishandling the &&& string. This may be used for remote code execution under rare conditions of filtered command input. | `hush` | 1.33.0-1.33.1 | DoS & Possible RCE | [6.4](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| **CVE-2021-42378** | A use-after-free in awk leads to denial of service and possibly code execution when processing a crafted `awk` pattern in the `getvar_i` function | `awk` | 1.16-1.33.1 | DoS & Possible RCE | [6.6](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |

## Triggering the Vulnerabilities

Since the affected applets are not daemons, each vulnerability can only be exploited if the vulnerable applet is fed with untrusted data (usually through a command-line argument). Specifically, these are the conditions that must occur for each vulnerability to be triggered:

**CVE-2021-42373** – Applies if the attacker can control all parameters passed to [`man`](https://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html#man).

`man` is built by the default BusyBox configuration, but not shipped with Ubuntu’s default BusyBox binary.

**CVE-2021-42374** – Applies if the attacker can supply a crafted compressed file, that will be decompressed by using [`unlzma`](https://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html#unlzma).

Note that even if the unlzma applet is not available, but `CONFIG_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_LZMA` (enabled by default) is enabled, other applets such as `tar`, `unzip`, `rpm`, `dpkg,lzma` and `man` can also reach the vulnerable code when handling a file with the `.lzma` filename suffix.

`unlzma` is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu’s default BusyBox binary.

**CVE-2021-42375** – Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to [`ash`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almquist_shell) that contains the special characters $, {, }, # .

`ash` is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu’s default BusyBox binary.

**CVE-2021-42376** – Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to [`hush`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) that contains the special character \x03 (delimiter).

`hush` is built by the default BusyBox configuration but not shipped with Ubuntu’s default BusyBox binary.

**CVE-2021-42377** – Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to [`hush`](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unix_shell) that contains the special character &.

**CVE-2021-42378 – CVE-2021-42386** – Applies if the attacker can supply an arbitrary pattern to [`awk`](https://busybox.net/downloads/BusyBox.html#awk) (the pattern is the first positional argument this applet takes).

`awkƒ` is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu’s default BusyBox binary.

## Research Methodology

To research BusyBox, we used static and dynamic analysis approaches.

First, a manual review of the BusyBox source code was conducted in a top-down approach (following user input up to specific applet handling). We also looked for obvious logical/memory corruption vulnerabilities.

The next approach was fuzzing. We compiled BusyBox with [ASan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer) and implemented an [AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL) harness for each BusyBox applet. Each harness was subsequently optimized by removing unnecessary parts of the code, running multiple fuzzing cycles on the same process ([persistent mode](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2015/06/new-in-afl-persistent-mode.html)), and running multiple fuzzed instances in parallel.

We started from fuzzing all the daemon applets, including HTTP, Telnet, DNS, DHCP, NTP and others. Many code changes were required in order to effectively fuzz network-based input. For example, the main modification we performed was to replace all recv functions with input from STDIN in order to support fuzzed inputs. Similar changes were done when we fuzzed non-server applets as well.

We prepared a couple of examples for each applet and ran hundreds of fuzzed BusyBox instances for a few days. This gave us tens of thousands of crashes to evaluate. We had to create classes of crashes with the same root cause to help reduce the volume of crashes we had in our sample set. Later, we minimized each group representative in order to work with a small subset of unique crash inputs.

To fulfill these tasks, we developed automatic tooling that digested all crash data and classified it based on the crash analysis report which mainly includes the crash stack trace, registers, and assembly code of the relevant code area. For example, we merged cases with similar crash stack traces because they usually had the same problematic root cause.

Finally, we researched each unique crash and minimized its input vector in order to understand the root cause, which allowed us to create a proof-of-concept (PoC) that exploits the vulnerability responsible for the crash. In addition, we tested our PoCs against several BusyBox versions to understand when the bugs were introduced to the source code.

In summary, following are the steps we took in our research:

1. Code review
2. Fuzzing
3. Reduction & Minimization
4. Triage
5. PoC
6. Testing multiple versions
7. Disclosure

## Guide and Resources for BusyBox Fuzzing

As part of our commitment to the open source security and security communities, we created a simple on-boarding guide detailing how to fuzz BusyBox. The guide is published alongside all of the fuzzing harnesses we wrote as part of our fuzzing efforts. We hope these fuzzing harnesses can be further improved by the community, in order to find and fix even more bugs in BusyBox.

All materials are available on [Claroty’s GitHub page](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing).

## Threat Analysis

To assess the threat level posed by these vulnerabilities, we inspected JFrog’s database of more than 10,000 embedded firmware images (composed of only publicly available firmware images, and not ones uploaded to JFrog Artifactory). We found that 40% of them contained a BusyBox executable file that is linked with one of the affected applets, making these issues extremely widespread among Linux-based embedded firmware.

However, we believe these issues do not currently pose a critical security threat because:

1. The DoS vulnerabilities are trivial to exploit, but the impact is usually mitigated by the fact that applets almost always run as a separate forked process.
2. The information leak vulnerability is nontrivial to exploit (see, next section).
3. The use-after-free vulnerabilities may be exploitable for remote code execution, but currently we did not attempt to create a weaponized exploit for them. In addition, it is quite rare (and inherently unsafe) to process an `awk` pattern from external input.

## Deep Dive on CVE-2021-42374 – LZMA OOB Read

Lempel–Ziv–Markov Chain Algorithm (LZMA) and Range Coding

[LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm) is a compression algorithm that uses dictionary compression, and encodes its output using a range encoder. The dictionary compressor finds matches using sophisticated dictionary data structures, and produces a stream of literal symbols and phrase references, which are encoded one bit at a time by the range encoder, using a complex model to make a probability prediction of each bit.

The compression algorithm encodes the compressed stream as a stream of bits using an adaptive binary range coder. Data is broken into packets, where each packet describes either a single byte, or an LZ77 sequence, with its length and distance implicitly or explicitly encoded.

The .lzma format consists of a 13-byte header followed by the LZMA compressed data. Here is a small example of compressing the string “abc” using:![LZMA file format](data:image/svg+xml...)![LZMA file format](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07132002/LZMA-file-format.png)

In order to output the decompressed stream, LZMA implementations use a memory buffer that is initialized in the size of the user-provided dictionary size (part of the LZMA header). Once that buffer is filled, it automatically outputs the data thus far, flushes the buffer and starts filling it up again.

### The Vulnerability

The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient size check in the `unpack_lzma_stream` function (in decompress\_unlzma.c) when the state >= `LZMA_NUM_LIT_STATES`:

```
while (global_pos + buffer_pos < header.dst_size) {
    ...
    uint32_t pos;

    pos = buffer_pos - rep0;
    if ((int32_t)pos < 0)           // Insufficient check
        pos += header.dict_size; 	// dict_size is user-controlled
    match_byte = buffer[pos]; 	// Read OOB may occur here
    do {
        int bit;

        match_byte <<= 1;
        bit = match_byte & 0x100;
        ...
```

To trigger the vulnerability and to control the starting offset where we will leak data from, we need to make sure that the following conditions are satisfied:

`buffer_pos = 0

and

rep0 = offset + dict_size`

This way, `pos` will be equal to `-(offset + dict_size)`. After adding `dict_size`, `pos` will be `-offset` and so we could leak memory from our desired offset through match\_byte. The leaked memory will most likely contain pointers which could further assist attackers in their exploitation campaign (ex. by facilitating ASLR bypass).

### Causing an Out-of-Bounds Access

The general idea to exploit this vulnerability is to prepare a specifically crafted LZMA encoded stream, so that when it is decoded, both conditions will be filled and `pos` will be equal to a negative number `-offset`. Eventually, the decompressed stream will contain the leaked memory, which will be written to the output steam.

To satisfy the first condition `buffer_pos = 0`, we need to make sure our code flow (`state >= LZMA_NUM_LIT_STATES`) is reached right after the current decompressed buffer stream is flushed and so the buffer pointer position will be 0. We can achieve this by reaching the last iteration of a current match:

```
buffer[buffer_pos++] = previous_byte;
if (buffer_pos == header.dict_size) {
	buffer_pos = 0;
	global_pos += header.dict_size;
	if (transformer_write(xstate, buffer, header.dict_size) != (ssize_t)header.dict_size)
		goto bad;
	IF_DESKTOP(total_written += header.dict_size;)
}
len--;
} while (len != 0 && buffer_pos < header.dst_size); // match_last_iteration will end with buffer_pos = 0;
```

The second condition is more difficult to satisfy and requires intimate knowledge of how the LZMA algorithm works. The general idea is to encode a special length in the LZMA bit stream so that when decoded it will be used by the `rep0` variable.

To conclude, in order to reach an OOB condition, we need to write some bytes, then use a match to fill the buffer to `header.dict_size and` change `rep0` to our desired value. Therefore, `pos` will be equal `-offset` and we could leak bytes from offset as a reference to the buffer pointer.

### Leaking Bits from Out-of-Bounds Memory

After reading the `match_byte`, we will get to this flow:

```
do {
	int bit;

	match_byte <<= 1;
	bit = match_byte & 0x100;
	bit ^= (rc_get_bit(rc, prob + 0x100 + bit + mi, &mi) << 8); /* 0x100 or 0 */
	if (bit)
		break;
} while (mi < 0x100);

while (mi < 0x100) {
	rc_get_bit(rc, prob + mi, &mi);
}
```

As long as the bits match our match\_byte (the leaked byte), it will be in the loop that reads the probability from `prob + 0x100 + bit + mi`, but once one bit is not matched, it reads it from `prob + mi`. We can detect what was the first unmatched bit, by checking if `prob + mi` was changed by writing more literal bytes, or if the probability was changed and we got a different output. Finally, the leaked bits will get flushed to the decompressed buffer.

### Weaponizing ZIP Files

Although the vulnerability was found in the LZMA decompression algorithm, we found that many applets support an LZMA compression and will try to decompress encoded LZMA streams by default (see section, “Fixes and Workarounds” for the configuration flags governing this behavior). For example, the ubiquitous ZIP format supports LZMA compression as a “type 14” compression.

From an attacker’s perspective, ZIP is a much better attack vector since:

* `unzip` invocations are much more common than direct invocations of `unlzma`.
* With this attack vector, there are no constraints on the filename that’s going to be unzipped (unlike in the tar attack vector, which requires a `.lzma` suffix).
* The leaked data can be extracted and saved into files that can be later read remotely. For example, this can happen in an embedded web service that permits uploading zip files with media resources, which will get extracted to an accessible location. From there, the attacker could read the leaked memory data.

To test this, we built a small PoC script that generates a weaponized ZIP where one of the files is compressed using LZMA:

![Test PoC script](data:image/svg+xml...)![Test PoC script](https://speedmedia.jfrog.com/08612fe1-9391-4cf3-ac1a-6dd49c36b276/media.jfrog.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/11/07132524/Test-PoC-script.png)

## Fixes and Workarounds

All 14 vulnerabilities have been fixed in BusyBox 1.34.0 ([direct download link](https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.34.0.tar.bz2)) and users are urged to upgrade.

If upgrading BusyBox is not possible (due to specific version compatibility needs), BusyBox 1.33.1 and earlier versions can be compiled without the vulnerable functionality (applets) as a workaround.

After running `make defconfig` in BusyBox’s source directory (or if reusing a previous configuration), edit the `.config` file as such:

* `man` – Comment out `CONFIG_MAN=y`
* `lzma` – Comment out `CONFIG_UNLZMA=y`, `CONFIG_FEATURE_SEAMLESS_LZMA=y` and `CONFIG_FEATURE_UNZIP_LZMA=y`
* `ash` – Comment out `CONFIG_ASH=y`
* `hush` – Comment out `CONFIG_HUSH=y`
* `awk` – Comment out `CONFIG_AWK=y`

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Denys Vlasenko from BusyBox’s development team for validating and fixing all of the above issues in a swift manner [for version 1.34.0](https://busybox.net/).

![Unboxing BusyBox: 14 Vulnerabilities Uncovered by Claroty, JFrog](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy82MzI3NDc1OWM0MDI1YWU5ZjgwMzI3MDYzZWNkNzY1YS1idXN5Ym94LWFsdC5wbmc=/63274759c4025ae9f80327063ecd765a-busybox-alt.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&w=800&h=450&s=e05200da22c28a633e9abd3c3d513b78)

## Executive Summary

* Team82 and researchers from JFrog collaborated to research the security of BusyBox, a suite of Linux utilities used in IT use cases, as well as OT and IoT
* Many popular PLCs, HMIs, and RTUs run on Linux and have BusyBox utilities running under the hood.
* Our combined research uncovered 14 vulnerabilities affecting current versions of BusyBox, which was updated in version 1.34.0
* Most of the vulnerabilities could allow an attacker to disrupt services, causing a denial of service condition.
* In some cases, information leaks or remote code execution is possible.
* As part of this research, Team82 is making freely available the [custom AFL fuzzing harnesses](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing) used in this research.

## What is BusyBox?

Embedded devices with limited memory and storage resources are likely to leverage a tool such as [BusyBox](https://www.busybox.net/), which is marketed as the Swiss Army Knife of embedded Linux. BusyBox is a software suite of many useful Unix utilities, known as applets, that are packaged as a single executable file. Within BusyBox you can find a full fledged shell, a DHCP client/server, and small utilities such as cp, ls, grep, and others. You're also likely to find many OT and IoT devices running BusyBox, including popular programmable logic controllers (PLCs), human-machine interfaces (HMIs), and remote terminal units (RTUs)—many of which now run on Linux.

As part of our commitment to [improving open-source software security](https://www.wwnytv.com/prnewswire/2021/10/13/entry-level-kubernetes-certification-help-advance-cloud-careers/), Claroty's Team82 and JFrog collaborated on a vulnerability research project examining BusyBox. Using static and dynamic techniques, Claroty's Team82 and JFrog discovered 14 vulnerabilities affecting the latest version of BusyBox. All vulnerabilities were privately disclosed and fixed by BusyBox in [version 1.34.0, which was released Aug. 19](https://busybox.net/).

In most cases, the expected impact of these issues is denial of service (DoS). However, in rarer cases, these issues can also lead to information leaks and possibly remote code execution.

In this report, we will provide details about the vulnerabilities, elaborate on who is affected, discuss our research methodology, explain one of the vulnerabilities in depth, and suggest fixes and workarounds for these issues.

In addition to disclosing the vulnerabilities, Team82 is also open-sourcing its [custom AFL fuzzing harnesses](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing), which were responsible for triggering many of the mentioned vulnerabilities. Hopefully this will help fellow researchers find and disclose even more issues.

## Discovered Vulnerabilities in BusyBox

![BusyBox Discovered Vulnerabilities](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9lMmMwNmRjYTU2MTUyNGM0YTA4YWZkYzUzYWM5YTg1MS1CdXN5Qm94X1RhYmxlLTEtOTgzeDEwMjQuanBn/e2c06dca561524c4a08afdc53ac9a851-BusyBox_Table-1-983x1024.jpg?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=3e25f1f3314d5109764230141d604b37)
### Triggering the Vulnerabilities

Since the affected applets are not daemons, each vulnerability can only be exploited if the vulnerable applet is fed with untrusted data (usually through a command-line argument). Specifically, these are the conditions that must occur for each vulnerability to be triggered:

#### [CVE-2021-42373:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42373)

Applies if the attacker can control all parameters passed to man.
man is built by the default BusyBox configuration, but not shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42374:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42374)

Applies if the attacker can supply a crafted compressed file, that will be decompressed by using unlzma.
Note that even if the unlzma applet is not available, but CONFIG\_FEATURE\_SEAMLESS\_LZMA (enabled by default) is enabled, other applets such as tar, unzip, rpm, dpkg,lzma and man can also reach the vulnerable code when handling a file with the .lzma filename suffix.
unlzma is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42375:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42375)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to ash that contains the special characters $, {, }, or # .
ash is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42376:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42376)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to hush that contains the special character \x03 (delimiter).
hush is built by the default BusyBox configuration, but not shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

#### [CVE-2021-42377:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42377)

Applies if the attacker can supply a command line to hush that contains the special character &.

#### [CVE-2021-42378](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42378), [CVE-2021-42386:](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42386)

Applies if the attacker can supply an arbitrary pattern to awk (the pattern is the first positional argument this applet takes).
awk is built by the default BusyBox configuration and shipped with Ubuntu's default BusyBox binary.

## Research Methodology

To research BusyBox, we used static and dynamic analysis approaches.

First, a manual review of the BusyBox source code was conducted in a top-down approach (following user input up to specific applet handling). We also looked for obvious logical/memory corruption vulnerabilities.

The next approach was fuzzing. We compiled BusyBox with [ASan](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/AddressSanitizer) and implemented an [AFL](https://github.com/google/AFL) harness for each BusyBox applet. Each harness was subsequently optimized by removing unnecessary parts of the code, running multiple fuzzing cycles on the same process [(persistent mode)](https://lcamtuf.blogspot.com/2015/06/new-in-afl-persistent-mode.html), and running multiple fuzzed instances in parallel.

We started from fuzzing all the daemon applets, including HTTP, Telnet, DNS, DHCP, NTP etc. Many code changes were required in order to effectively fuzz network-based input. For example, the main modification we performed was to replace all recv functions with input from STDIN in order to support fuzzed inputs. Similar changes were done when we fuzzed non-server applets as well.

We prepared a couple of examples for each applet and ran hundreds of fuzzed BusyBox instances for a few days. This gave us tens of thousands of crashes to evaluate. We had to create classes of crashes with the same root cause to help reduce the volume of crashes we had in our sample set. Later, we minimized each group representative in order to work with a small subset of unique crash inputs.

To fulfill these tasks, we developed automatic tooling that digested all crash data and classified it based on the crash analysis report which mainly includes the crash stack trace, registers, and assembly code of the relevant code area. For example, we merged cases with similar crash stack traces because they usually had the same problematic root cause.

Finally, we researched each unique crash and minimized its input vector in order to understand the root cause, which allowed us to create a proof-of-concept (PoC) that exploits the vulnerability responsible for the crash. In addition, we tested our PoCs against several BusyBox versions to understand when the bugs were introduced to the source code.

**To summarize, here are the steps we took in our research:**

1. Code Review
2. Fuzzing
3. Reduction and Minimization
4. Triage
5. Proof of Concept
6. Testing Multiple Versions
7. Disclosure

## Guide, Resources for BusyBox Fuzzing

As part of our commitment to the OSS and security communities, we created a simple on-boarding guide detailing how to fuzz BusyBox. The guide is published alongside all of the fuzzing harnesses we wrote as part of our fuzzing efforts. We hope these fuzzing harnesses can be further improved by the community, in order to find and fix even more bugs in BusyBox.

**All materials are available on [Claroty's GitHub page](https://github.com/claroty/busybox-fuzzing).**

## Threat Analysis

To assess the threat level posed by these vulnerabilities, we inspected JFrog's database of more than 10,000 embedded firmware images (comprised of only publicly available firmware, and not images uploaded to JFrog's Artifactory). We found that 40% of them contained a BusyBox executable file that is linked with one of the affected applets, making these issues extremely widespread among Linux-based embedded firmware.

However, we believe these issues do not currently pose a critical security threat because:

1. While the DoS vulnerabilities are trivial to exploit, the impact is usually mitigated by the fact that applets almost always run as a separate forked process.
2. The information leak vulnerability is nontrivial to exploit (see, next section).
3. The use-after-free vulnerabilities may be exploitable for remote code execution, but currently we did not attempt to create a weaponized exploit for them. In addition, it is quite rare (and inherently unsafe) to process an awk pattern from external input.

## Deep Dive: [CVE-2021-42374](https://claroty.com/team82/disclosure-dashboard/cve-2021-42374): LZMA OOB Read

### Lempel-Ziv-Markov Chain Algorithm (LZMA) and Range Coding

[LZMA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lempel%E2%80%93Ziv%E2%80%93Markov_chain_algorithm) is a compression algorithm that uses dictionary compression, and encodes its output using a range encoder. The dictionary compressor finds matches using sophisticated dictionary data structures, and produces a stream of literal symbols and phrase references, which are encoded one bit at a time by the range encoder, using a complex model to make a probability prediction of each bit.

The compression algorithm encodes the compressed stream as a stream of bits using an adaptive binary range coder. Data is broken into packets, where each packet describes either a single byte, or an LZ77 sequence, with its length and distance implicitly or explicitly encoded.

The .lzma format, below, consists of a 13-byte header followed by the LZMA compressed data. Here is a small example of compressing the string "abc" using LZMA:

![LZMA file format](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9kMDNhZTNhMWFlN2Q1NmVjNDNhNzkwZjE1YmVmYTlkZC1MWk1BLnBuZw==/d03ae3a1ae7d56ec43a790f15befa9dd-LZMA.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ff0e1e34fcf6feed7aed6dcfdd08cfee)

In order to output the decompressed stream, LZMA implementations use a memory buffer that is initialized in the size of the user-provided dictionary size (part of the LZMA header). Once that buffer is filled, it automatically outputs the data thus far, flushes the buffer and starts filling it up again.

## The Vulnerability

The vulnerability is caused by an insufficient size check, below, in the function decompress\_unlzma.c (at line 295) when the state >= LZMA\_NUM\_LIT\_STATES:

![BusyBox Screen](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy83MmZiNWFlZDJjMTE3NjUyYjRjNzU0YmRiNzFlODUxZi1CdXN5Ym94U2NyZWVuLVNob3QxLnBuZw==/72fb5aed2c117652b4c754bdb71e851f-BusyboxScreen-Shot1.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=871614b4e1d8ca01181f87fd19d71b0b)

To trigger the vulnerability and to control the starting offset where we will leak data from, we need to make sure that the following conditions are satisfied:

buffer\_pos = 0
and
rep0 = offset + dict\_size

This way, pos will be equal to -(offset + dict\_size). After adding dict\_size, pos will be -offset and so we could leak memory from our desired offset through match\_byte. The leaked memory will most likely contain pointers which could further assist attackers in their exploitation campaign (ex. by facilitating ASLR bypass).

## Causing an Out-of-Bounds Access

The general idea to exploit this vulnerability is to prepare a specifically crafted LZMA encoded stream, so that when it is decoded, both conditions will be filled and pos will be equal to a negative number -offset. Eventually, the decompressed stream will contain the leaked memory, which will be written to the output steam.

To satisfy the first condition buffer\_pos = 0, we need to make sure our code flow (state >= LZMA\_NUM\_LIT\_STATES) is reached right after the current decompressed buffer stream is flushed and so the buffer pointer position will be 0. We can achieve this by reaching the last iteration, below, of a current match:

![BusyBox Buffer Screen](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy80NDRkMjA2YjNkYWYzYzY2MDgxMTU5OTZlODMwODk5MS1CdXN5Ym94LXNjcmVlbnNob3QyLnBuZw==/444d206b3daf3c6608115996e8308991-Busybox-screenshot2.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=6a65d75f65861c4938c240f7b32a72c4)

The second condition is more difficult to satisfy and requires intimate knowledge of how the LZMA algorithm works. The general idea is to encode a special length in the LZMA bit stream so that when decoded it will be used by the rep0 variable.

To conclude, in order to reach an OOB condition, we need to write some bytes, then use a match to fill the buffer to header.dict\_size and change rep0 to our desired value. Therefore, pos will be equal -offset and we could leak bytes from offset as a reference to the buffer pointer.

## Leaking Bits from Out-of-Bounds Memory

After reading the match\_byte, we will get to this flow, below:

![BusyBox Vulnerability](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9lMjVkYmMwMWRlMmQ0NWYzOWRmNzZmZDMzN2EyMGJjZi1CdXN5Ym94LXNjcmVlbnNob3QzLnBuZw==/e25dbc01de2d45f39df76fd337a20bcf-Busybox-screenshot3.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ee3df1ca72ffcf74de23e3bcdd84f164)

As long as the bits match our match\_byte (the leaked byte), it will be in the loop that reads the probability from prob + 0x100 + bit + mi, but once one bit is not matched, it reads it from prob + mi. We can detect what was the first unmatched bit, by checking if prob + mi was changed by writing more literal bytes, or if the probability was changed and we got a different output. Finally, the leaked bits will get flushed to the decompressed buffer.

## Weaponizing ZIP Files

Although the vulnerability was found in the LZMA decompression algorithm, we found that many applets support an LZMA compression and will try to decompress encoded LZMA streams by default (see section, "Fixes and Workarounds" for the configuration flags governing this behavior). For example, the ubiquitous ZIP format supports LZMA compression as a "type 14" compression.

From an attacker's perspective, ZIP is a much better attack vector because:

* unzip invocations are much more common than direct invocations of unlzma.
* With this attack vector, there are no constraints on the filename that's going to be unzipped (unlike in the tar attack vector, which requires a .lzma suffix).
* The leaked data can be extracted and saved into files that can be later read remotely. For example, this can happen in an embedded web service that permits uploading zip files with media resources, which will get extracted to an accessible location. From there, the attacker could read the leaked memory data.

To test this, we built a small PoC script that generates a weaponized ZIP where one of the files is compressed using LZMA, below:

![Segmentation Fault](/img/asset/YXNzZXRzL2ltcG9ydGVkLWltYWdlcy9kYmVlYWE5ZDg4MTc2NTA5YjgwZmZmZTA4MzVhOGM3Yi1MWk1BY29kZS0xMDI0eDUyMS5wbmc=/dbeeaa9d88176509b80fffe0835a8c7b-LZMAcode-1024x521.png?fm=webp&fit=crop&s=ae2d5c26a57ff37701b0b4a42298b9fe)
## Fixes and Workarounds

All 14 vulnerabilities have been fixed in BusyBox 1.34.0 ([direct download link](https://busybox.net/downloads/busybox-1.34.0.tar.bz2)) and users are urged to upgrade.

If upgrading BusyBox is not possible (due to specific version compatibility needs), BusyBox 1.33.1 and earlier versions can be compiled without the vulnerable functionality (applets) as a workaround.

After running make deconfig in BusyBox's source directory (or if reusing a previous configuration), edit the .config file such as:

* man - Comment out CONFIG\_MAN=y
* lzma - Comment out CONFIG\_UNLZMA=y , CONFIG\_FEATURE\_SEAMLESS\_LZMA=y and CONFIG\_FEATURE\_UNZIP\_LZMA=y
* ash - Comment out CONFIG\_ASH=y
* hush - Comment out CONFIG\_HUSH=y
* awk - Comment out CONFIG\_AWK=y

## Acknowledgements

We would like to thank Denys Vlasenko from BusyBox's development team for validating and fixing all of the above issues in a swift manner for [version 1.34.0](https://busybox.net/).
