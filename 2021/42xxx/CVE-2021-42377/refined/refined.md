{
  "CVE-2021-42377": {
    "Root cause": "The hush shell mishandles the `&&&` string, leading to an attacker-controlled pointer free.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Improper handling of special characters in shell commands",
      "Use of attacker-controlled pointer in a free operation"
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service and potential code execution",
    "Attack vectors": "Crafted shell command containing the `&&&` string, supplied as a command-line argument to the `hush` applet.",
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Ability to supply a command-line argument to the `hush` applet. Rare conditions of filtered command input might be required for remote code execution."
