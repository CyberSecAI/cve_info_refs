Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-42662:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The provided content from github.com/0xDeku/CVE-2021-42662 clearly states: `CVE-2021-42662 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the Online event booking and reservation system version 2.3.0.`
   - The exploit-db entry 50450 also references the same system with the same vulnerable parameter
   - The sourcecodester.com page links to the vulnerable application.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**

   - The root cause is a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the "reason" parameter in the Online Event Booking and Reservation System. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or encode user-provided data before storing and displaying it, resulting in a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

   - **Stored XSS:** The application stores unsanitized user input, making it vulnerable to Stored XSS. This means that an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code, which will be executed in the browsers of other users when they access the vulnerable page.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

   - **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a user's browser.
   - **Cookie Stealing:** The attacker can steal session cookies, potentially gaining unauthorized access to other users' accounts.
   - **Website Defacement:** The attacker can deface the web application or redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Other malicious activities such as performing actions on behalf of the user, keylogging, etc.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

   - **Web Interface:** The attack vector is through the web interface of the Online Event Booking and Reservation System.
   - **"reason" parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is the "reason" field when adding a holiday.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

   - **Access to the Application:** The attacker requires access to the vulnerable web interface of the Online Event Booking and Reservation System.
   - **Ability to submit input to the "reason" parameter:** The attacker must have the ability to submit a malicious payload through the "reason" input field.
    - No special privileges needed to inject the payload.
   - **No authentication required to view injected payload** The payload is displayed to other users who view the relevant page.

**Technical Details (from 0xDeku's GitHub repository):**

*   **Vulnerable Page:**  `http://localhost/event-management/views/?v=HOLY`
*   **Vulnerable Parameter:**  `reason`
*   **Exploit Steps:**
    1.  Navigate to the vulnerable page.
    2.  Insert the XSS payload in the `reason` parameter.
    3.  Click "Add holiday".

*   **Proof of Concept Payload:** `<script>alert("This is an XSS")</script>`

**Additional Notes:**

*   The exploit-db entry states the vulnerability is in version 1.0. The GitHub repository states it is in version 2.3.0.
*   The sourcecodester.com provides a download link for the vulnerable software.

In summary, the vulnerability is a classic stored XSS issue due to inadequate input sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code, leading to potential cookie theft, website defacement, and other malicious activities. The attack vector is through the "reason" parameter on the "add holiday" page of the vulnerable application.
