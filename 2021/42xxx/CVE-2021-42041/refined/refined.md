{
  "cve": "CVE-2021-42041",
  "description": "The provided content describes a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the 'setchange' log of the CentralAuth MediaWiki extension.",
  "information": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability occurs because the CentralAuth extension's 'setchange' log message uses unescaped text from the MediaWiki:rightsnone message, allowing an attacker to inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Insufficient output sanitization/encoding"
     ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of users viewing the logs (e.g., Special:Log or Special:WikiSets page). This could be used to steal cookies, perform actions on behalf of users, or deface the page.",
    "attack_vectors": "The attack vector involves manipulating the MediaWiki:rightsnone message to include malicious JavaScript code, then triggering the vulnerable code path by changing wiki sets, leading to the malicious content being logged, and therefore rendered.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to have editinterface permission on the wiki to modify the MediaWiki:rightsnone message. This is typically held by sysops, cn-admins, or int-admins on a MediaWiki instance."
  },
  "remediation": "The vulnerability was patched by escaping HTML in the setchange log message, preventing the execution of injected JavaScript. Patches were made to various branches of the CentralAuth extension."
