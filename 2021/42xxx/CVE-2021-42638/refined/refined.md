  "CVE-2021-42638": {
    "description": "The PrinterLogic software has a command injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-42638) that can lead to remote code execution on connected endpoints. This is one of three high-severity vulnerabilities, alongside CVE-2021-42631 (object injection) and CVE-2021-42635 (hardcoded APP_KEY), discovered by The Paranoids research team at Yahoo.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to miscellaneous command injection issues in the PrinterLogic software.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Command Injection",
       "Object Injection",
      "Hardcoded APP_KEY"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation allows for remote code execution (RCE) on the web stack server and arbitrary endpoints connected to it. Attackers can compromise the server, gain persistent access, and then manipulate driver packages to achieve code execution on client workstations. This can lead to widespread compromise within an organization, including unauthorized access to sensitive systems and data.",
    "attack_vectors": "The primary attack vector involves exploiting the PrinterLogic web stack server. This requires a privileged network position, typically achieved through a VPN or another vulnerability (like SSRF) in an edge appliance. Once the server is compromised, attackers can manipulate the database to inject malicious driver packages. Additionally, they can use PrinterLogicâ€™s features to push these malicious drivers to arbitrary endpoints. The single-click printer installation feature, and the printer deployment based on hostnames, are also part of the attack chain, allowing for RCE on connected endpoints.",
    "required_capabilities": "Attackers need a privileged network position (VPN or edge appliance vulnerability), the ability to manipulate the PrinterLogic database, and knowledge of the system's driver package deployment mechanism. No user interaction is required for the vulnerability to be fully exploited and compromise all endpoints"
