**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of input validation in the "STORAGE UNIT RENTAL MANAGEMENT SYSTEM v1.0" application. Specifically, the "New Tenant" form does not sanitize user-supplied inputs, leading to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The application stores unsanitized user input, allowing malicious JavaScript code to be injected into the database.

**Impact of exploitation:**
