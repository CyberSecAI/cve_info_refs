| [CVE-2024-50066](https://cxsecurity.com/cveshow/CVE-2024-50066/ "CVE-2024-50066") | [In the Linux kernel, the following vulnerability has been resolved: mm/mremap: fix move\_normal\_pmd/retract\_page\_tables race In mremap(), move\_page\_tables() looks at the type of the PMD entry and the specified address range to figure out by which method the next chunk of page table entries should be moved.

At that point, the mmap_lock is held in write mode, but no rmap locks are held yet.  For PMD entries that point to page tables and are fully covered by the source address range, move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...) is called, which first takes rmap locks, then does move_normal_pmd().  move_normal_pmd() takes the necessary page table locks at source and destination, then moves an entire page table from the source to the destination.  The problem is: The rmap locks, which protect against concurrent page table removal by retract_page_tables() in the THP code, are only taken after the PMD entry has been read and it has been decided how to move it.  So we can race as follows (with two processes that have mappings of the same tmpfs file that is stored on a tmpfs mount with huge=advise); note that process A accesses page tables through the MM while process B does it through the file rmap:  process A                      process B =========                      ========= mremap   mremap_to     move_vma       move_page_tables         get_old_pmd         alloc_new_pmd                       *** PREEMPT ***                                madvise(MADV_COLLAPSE)                                  do_madvise                                    madvise_walk_vmas                                      madvise_vma_behavior                                        madvise_collapse                                          hpage_collapse_scan_file                                            collapse_file                                              retract_page_tables                                                i_mmap_lock_read(mapping)                                                pmdp_collapse_flush                                                i_mmap_unlock_read(mapping)         move_pgt_entry(NORMAL_PMD, ...)           take_rmap_locks           move_normal_pmd           drop_rmap_locks  When this happens, move_normal_pmd() can end up creating bogus PMD entries in the line `pmd_populate(mm, new_pmd, pmd_pgtable(pmd))`.  The effect depends on arch-specific and machine-specific details; on x86, you can end up with physical page 0 mapped as a page table, which is likely exploitable for user->kernel privilege escalation.  Fix the race by letting process B recheck that the PMD still points to a page table after the rmap locks have been taken.  Otherwise, we bail and let the caller fall back to the PTE-level copying path, which will then bail immediately at the pmd_none() check.  Bug reachability: Reaching this bug requires that you can create shmem/file THP mappings - anonymous THP uses different code that doesn't zap stuff under rmap locks.  File THP is gated on an experimental config flag (CONFIG_READ_ONLY_THP_FOR_FS), so on normal distro kernels you need shmem THP to hit this bug.  As far as I know, getting shmem THP normally requires that you can mount your own tmpfs with the right mount flags, which would require creating your own user+mount namespace; though I don't know if some distros maybe enable shmem THP by default or something like that.  Bug impact: This issue can likely be used for user->kernel privilege escalation when it is reachable.") |  |

## **Introduction**

This is a **Storage Unit Rental Management System** in **PHP**. This is a simple project that can help manage the storage unit rentals businesses record and monitor their records. The system is a web-based application that contains several functionalities that are relevant for the said business. It has a pleasant user interface and user-friendly functionalities. The source code could be a good start for building your own **Storage Unit Rental Management System** and to learn some **PHP techniques/ideas** for those who are new to **PHP Language**.

## **About the Storage Unit Rental Management System**

I developed this project using the following:

* **[XAMPP v3.3.0](https://apachefreinds.org)** as my local webserver that has a **PHP Version 8.0.7**
* **PHP Language**
* **MySQL Database**
* **HTML**
* **CSS**
* **JavaScript**
* **jQuery**
* **Ajax**
* **Bootstrap**
* **AdminLTE Template**
* and some other libraries/plugins

The **Storage Unit Rental Management System** project has 2 types of system users which are the **Admin** and the **Staff**. The **Admin User** is in charge of populating the important list of the project such as the **Storage Unit List**. He/She has access and can manage all the features and functionalities this project has. The **Staff User** has only limited access to the project. The system requires all users to enter their system credentials in order to access the system features according to their user roles/types.

In this project, each storage unit has 3 different prices set by the admin user. The prices are the monthly, quarterly, and annual amounts. The tenant must be registered/created in the list before creating their unit rent records. Each rent records have an option to renew the contract which means when the rental expiry date will come, the system user can renew the rent contract of the tenants if they wish to continue renting the unit. Renewing the rent contract will automatically set the new expiry date according to the price type.

## **Features**

* **Secure Login/Logout**
* **Manage Storage Unit List**
