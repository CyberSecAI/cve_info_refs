**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability in the Revisor Video Management System (VMS) web server.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The web server in Revisor VMS allows an attacker to use special characters (e.g., `../`) in a file path to navigate outside of the intended web server's root directory. This enables them to access arbitrary files and directories.

*   **Web Server:** The vulnerability is present in the web server component of Revisor VMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send crafted HTTP requests to the web server.
*   No specific authentication or privileges on the system are required to exploit this vulnerability.
