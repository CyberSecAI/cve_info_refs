- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper design of password reset workflow, lacking proper authentication verification, combined with weak file permissions (ACLs) on the password reset executable. Also, hardcoded salt-password values were found.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Improper Access Control List (ACL) configuration.
    - Weak password reset mechanism lacking proper authentication.
    - Hardcoded reset salt-password values.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can reset the password of a web portal user, gaining administrative access to the Remote Access Plus (RAP) web portal, which contains sensitive information such as server configurations, deployed agent configurations, system information, vulnerability/patch status, user accounts, and private keys used for server authentication.
- **Attack vectors**: Local system access is required. Any user with access to the Windows system where the RAP application is installed, regardless of their role (admin or non-admin), can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - Local access to the Windows system where the vulnerable RAP server is installed.
    - No special privileges needed as any windows user (admin or non-admin) can execute the vulnerable reset executable due to misconfigured ACL permissions.
