Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with **CVE-2021-42362**:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly mentions the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-42362, which is identified as a code injection vulnerability in the WordPress Popular Posts plugin.  The descriptions from nintechnet.com and wpscan.com both confirm this association.

**2. Root Cause:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in **improper input validation** within the `is_image_url` and `fetch_external_image` functions of the `Image.php` file of the WordPress Popular Posts plugin. The plugin insufficiently validates URLs for images, allowing an attacker to bypass the file type verification, download a remote PHP script to the server, and subsequently execute it. Specifically, the validation used regex (`preg_match`) that could be bypassed, and the functions `exif_imagetype` and `getimagesize`, which can be spoofed by malicious files.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inadequate URL Validation:** The `is_image_url` function does not properly validate the URL, allowing it to pass malicious URLs.
*   **Insufficient File Type Verification:** The functions used to verify if a downloaded file is actually an image (`exif_imagetype` and `getimagesize`) can be bypassed by a specifically crafted malicious file.
*   **Insecure File Handling:** Downloaded files are stored on the server and can be executed if the URL is crafted to point to a malicious file, without proper sanitization or extension enforcement.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary PHP code on the server, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **Data Breach:** The RCE can be used to gain access to the database and other files, leading to sensitive information exposure.
*   **Website Defacement or Takeover:** An attacker could deface the site, redirect visitors to malicious sites, or take full control of the affected WordPress installation.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Custom Field Abuse:** The vulnerability is triggered when the "Custom field name" and "Resize image from Custom field" options are used in the plugin settings for the image thumbnails. An attacker can then inject a malicious URL into the custom field of a post.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated Contributor or Higher User Role:** An attacker needs to have a WordPress user account with at least the Contributor role (or higher) on the targeted website.
*   **Access to Custom Fields:**  The attacker needs the ability to modify the custom field where the malicious URL will be injected.
*   **Remote Server:** The attacker needs access to a remote server where the malicious PHP script is hosted, as this will be the target of the plugin's download process.
*  **Specific Plugin Configuration**: The thumbnail settings of the plugin must be configured to use custom field names and resized images from the custom field.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Jerome Bruandet of NinTechNet and was patched in version 5.3.3 of the WordPress Popular Posts plugin.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited to upload and execute arbitrary PHP code via a crafted URL.
*   The exploit does not need to bypass any authentication mechanism, as it leverages existing authenticated user capabilities.
*   The Wordfence blog, plugins.trac.wordpress.org, blog.nintechnet.com, and wpscan.com all have documentation for this issue.
