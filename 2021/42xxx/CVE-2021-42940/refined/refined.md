Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-42940

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the improper sanitization of user-supplied files, specifically SVG images. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to upload SVG files containing malicious JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is stored XSS, where malicious JavaScript code is embedded within a file and stored on the server. When the file is accessed by other users, the malicious script executes within their browser context.
- **Inadequate Input Sanitization:** The system fails to properly sanitize or validate user-uploaded SVG files, allowing the inclusion of potentially harmful script code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can use the XSS vulnerability to escalate their privileges, potentially gaining access to administrator or other high-privilege user accounts.
- **Site-Wide Account Takeovers:** Exploitation could lead to the compromise of multiple accounts on the application.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By escalating privileges, an attacker could upload and execute a malicious plugin, achieving arbitrary code execution on the server hosting the application.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The attack vector involves uploading a malicious SVG file through a user interface that allows file uploads.
- **SVG File Embedding:** The attacker embeds malicious JavaScript code within the SVG file itself.
- **Cross-Site Scripting:** The stored malicious JavaScript is executed when the SVG image is viewed by other users.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have an authenticated account on the Projeqtor application to be able to upload files. According to the advisory, even a low level user account can be used to perform this attack.
- **File Upload Access:** The attacker must have the ability to upload files on the application.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is present in Projeqtor version 9.3.1 and earlier.
- A proof of concept (PoC) for this vulnerability is available at Packet Storm Security and Exploit-DB.
- The vendor has released a fix in version 9.4.2.
