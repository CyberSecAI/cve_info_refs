- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An infinite loop bug exists during the handling of a ClientHello handshake message in TinyDTLS. This is triggered by sending a malformed ClientHello message with an odd length of cipher suites.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Infinite loop, buffer over-read.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of service (resource exhaustion due to the infinite loop), potential disclosure of sensitive information via buffer over-read.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a malformed ClientHello handshake message with an odd length of cipher suites to a vulnerable DTLS server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Remote attacker capable of sending network packets to a vulnerable server.
