Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-42521:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is a potential NULL pointer dereference in `vtkXMLTreeReader.cxx`.
- The code was not checking the return value of the `xmlDocGetRootElement` function from the libxml2 library, which can return NULL if it fails to retrieve the root element of an XML document.
- The `vtkXMLTreeReaderProcessElement` function then attempts to dereference this potentially NULL pointer without any check, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Null pointer dereference.
- Improper error handling - Specifically, failure to validate the return value of `xmlDocGetRootElement`.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- The application using `vtkXMLTreeReader` will crash.

**Attack vectors:**

- The attack vector is through a specially crafted or malformed XML document provided to the `vtkXMLTreeReader`.
- If an attacker can control or influence the XML document being processed by VTK, they can cause a denial of service (DoS) by crashing the application.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious XML file as input to the `vtkXMLTreeReader` class.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker might not need to be local since the vulnerable code is within the application processing the XML data.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability was fixed by adding a null check on the return value of `xmlDocGetRootElement` before attempting to use the returned pointer.
- The fix has been incorporated in VTK version 9.2.5 and was backported into the release branch.
- The fix was introduced in merge request 9586 and backported in merge request 9822
