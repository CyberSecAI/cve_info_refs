Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-42703:

* **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation, leading to a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input before including it in a generated web page. This allows an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code which can lead to:
    * Hijacking of user's cookie/session tokens
    * Redirecting the user to a malicious webpage
    * Performing unintended browser actions
* **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is exploited through malicious Javascript code injection via the web interface.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code. User interaction is required (the victim has to load the crafted page). The attacker can be remote, as the CVSS vector string indicates network access (AV:N).
