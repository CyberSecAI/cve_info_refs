{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is located in the mainfunction.cgi script of the DrayTek Vigor routers. The provided proof of concept (PoC) exploits a vulnerability by crafting a malicious login request.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "The specific vulnerability is not explicitly stated, but it involves sending a specially crafted login request to mainfunction.cgi. The request includes Base64 encoded data, indicating a potential vulnerability related to how the router handles login parameters.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism. While not explicitly stated, a successful bypass would allow for full control of the router.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through the web interface of the DrayTek Vigor routers, specifically by sending a POST request to the `/cgi-bin/mainfunction.cgi` endpoint with a crafted `application/raw` Content-Type.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable router's web interface. The attacker would need access to the network where the router is accessible.",
