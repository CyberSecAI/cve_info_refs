- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from the ability to upload custom packages to extend Zammad functionality. An attacker can exploit this by creating files outside the application's intended scope.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Command Injection. The ability to create files outside of the application scope is not properly sanitized, allowing for command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can perform command injection, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors**: By uploading a specially crafted package, an attacker can create files that will lead to command injection.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs the ability to upload custom packages to the Zammad instance.
