Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-42776:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection in the CloverDX Server Console.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XXE vulnerability: The server is parsing XML input without properly sanitizing or disabling external entity processing.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Allows an attacker to read content of local files on the CloverDX Server file system that they might not otherwise be authorized to access.
- The attacker can access files outside their regular sandbox.
- Confidentiality impact is rated high, as an attacker can potentially access sensitive information.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attack: A remote attacker can exploit this vulnerability through the server console.
- The attacker needs to be a logged-in user with 'Import server configuration' permission.
- User interaction is required, as the user needs to initiate the configuration import with the crafted XML.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have a valid account on the CloverDX Server.
- The attacker must have "Import server configuration" permission to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious XML payload and import it via the console.
