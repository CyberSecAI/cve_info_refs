We recommend that you upgrade your CloverDX to the latest version (CloverDX 5.12.1). You can find full description of this latest version in [CloverDX 5.12.1 Release Notes](https://support.cloverdx.com/releases/5.12#5-12-1).

If you cannot upgrade to the latest version:

1. If you have CloverDX 5.11.0 or 5.11.1, you can upgrade to CloverDX 5.11.2. [Release notes for CloverDX 5.11.2](https://support.cloverdx.com/releases/5.11#5-11-2).
2. If you have **older version** of CloverDX (older than CloverDX 5.11.0), we recommend that you upgrade to the latest version. If you are unable to update to the latest version (for example due to CloverDX Server compatibility requirements), you can upgrade to one of the fixed versions mentioned above or apply the mitigation steps mentioned below.

### Mitigation

If you are unable to update to one of the fixed CloverDX versions as mentioned above, you can apply following measures to limit the exposure:

* Disable *Import server configuration* permission for all users that do not require it as part of their work. Since this is a very powerful permission, only very limited group of users should have it enabled. This permission is only necessary when importing configuration and is not needed for regular Server operation. It is therefore possible to disable this permission for everyone if your processes do not require it.

To disable this permission for a user group, make sure group’s permissions are configured like this:

* *Import server configuration* permission is unchecked (checkbox is blank),
* *Server configuration management* permission is unchecked (checkbox is either blank or a “dash” symbol),
* *Configuration* permission is unchecked (checkbox is either blank or a “dash” symbol)
* *All permissions* permission is set to “dash”.

For more details about permissions see [our documentation](https://doc.cloverdx.com/latest/admin/groups.html).

* Limit permissions of your CloverDX Server on the host system. This can be done by ensuring your CloverDX Server runs with limited user that does not have access to any data that is not necessary for its normal operation – e.g., it should not have permissions to see other user’s data etc.
