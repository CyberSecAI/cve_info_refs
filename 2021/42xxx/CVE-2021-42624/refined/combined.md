| Hi [@Gabe-commiter](https://github.com/Gabe-commiter), I found a issue, that can trigger buffer overflow on your application. The issue exists on list\_common() function (from line 437 to 484) on ftpproto.c  By reading line by line, we can see you using sprintf() in your application. The problem appears when you defined buf and tmp variables both have 1024 length. Along with off's size = len(sprint()) so anytime you is using off += sprintf(), offset will be increased. Finally you get input from tmp to buf is trigger bufferoverflow.  ``` void list_common(session_t *sess) { 	DIR *dir = opendir("."); 	if (dir == NULL) 	{ 		return; 	}  	struct dirent *dt; 	struct stat sbuf; 	while ((dt = readdir(dir)) != NULL) 	{ 		if (lstat(dt->d_name, &sbuf) < 0) 		{ 			continue; 		}         if (dt->d_name[0] == '.') 		{ 			continue;         }  		char buf[1024] = {0}; //Defined buf's size is 1024  		const char *perms = statbuf_get_perms(&sbuf);  		int off = 0; 		off += sprintf(buf, "%s ", perms); // Define off size  		off += sprintf(buf + off, " %3d %-8d %-8d ", (int)sbuf.st_nlink, sbuf.st_uid, sbuf.st_gid);// Define next write position to avoid overwriting 		off += sprintf(buf + off, "%8lu ", (unsigned long)sbuf.st_size);  		const char *datebuf = statbuf_get_date(&sbuf); 		off += sprintf(buf + off, "%s ", datebuf); 		if (S_ISLNK(sbuf.st_mode)) 		{ 			char tmp[1024] = {0}; // Defined tmp's size is 1024 			readlink(dt->d_name, tmp, sizeof(tmp)); //Get tmp with sizeof(tmp), max is 1024 from path in dt->d_name 			off += sprintf(buf + off, "%s -> %s\r\n", dt->d_name, tmp); // Read tmp to buf with max size is 1024, and buf max size is also 1024 so trigger bufferoverflow 		} 		else 		{ 			off += sprintf(buf + off, "%s\r\n", dt->d_name); 		}  		writen(sess->data_fd, buf, strlen(buf)); 	}  	closedir(dir); }  ```  Exploit:  sprintf() on line 473 read tmp and dt->name data in format defined before. But with data already written in from previous code, we can only write 1024 - off bytes. In case tmp have maximum size, input read into buf += 1024 + "\n\r" + leng(dt->name). It will trigger bufferoverflow.  Solution : Please limit maximum input characters in snprintf(). Defined buff's maximum size is equal to the sum of the variables's size concatenated with the snprintf(). |
