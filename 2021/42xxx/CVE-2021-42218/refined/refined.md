Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42218:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A memory leak occurs in the `VFRRT.cpp` file of the OMPL (Open Motion Planning Library) v1.5.2.
- The issue stems from incorrect memory management within the `VFRRT` class. Specifically, a new `Motion` object is created using a constructor that allocates memory for a state. Subsequently, the allocated state is overwritten by a new state object, resulting in the memory originally allocated in the constructor becoming inaccessible, leading to a leak.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

-  **Memory leak**: Unreferenced memory is created and not freed.
- **Incorrect memory management**: The code allocates memory for a state object, but fails to properly handle it when a new state is assigned to the `Motion` object.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Resource exhaustion**: Repeated execution of the vulnerable code would lead to memory exhaustion. This can eventually cause the application to crash or become unstable, denying service.
- **Availability impact**:  The high impact on availability is reflected in the CVSS score (7.5).

**Attack vectors:**

- **Network**: As indicated by the CVSS base metric "Attack vector: Network". The vulnerability can be triggered remotely, not requiring local access to the system, although the specific mechanism to trigger this is not outlined in this content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **No privileges required**: The vulnerability can be triggered by any user, as indicated by the "Privileges required: None" CVSS base metric.
- **No user interaction**: The vulnerability does not require any user interaction to be triggered, which is indicated by the "User interaction: None" CVSS base metric.
