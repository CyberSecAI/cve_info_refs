### @fuzzard **[fuzzard](/fuzzard)** commented [Oct 12, 2021](#issue-1023500383)

## Description

Turn istream into a std::string to handle large buffers [#20305](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/20305)

## Motivation and context

Fixes [#20305](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/20305)

the >> operator of istream does no bounds checking and hangs/eventually crashes with large inputs as seen with the POC provided. Instead look to bring the istream into a std::string and then parse the string with tinyxml into the CXBMCTinyXML structure.

## How has this been tested?

OSX with the provided POC in [#20305](https://github.com/xbmc/xbmc/issues/20305), and another "good" sample asx file.

The POC errors out with the xmldoc.Error check. Good sample is processed correctly.

## What is the effect on users?

No crash with a malicious asx file

## Screenshots (if appropriate):
