**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue present in the REST API endpoints of Apereo CAS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The CAS REST API does not properly sanitize input parameters in POST requests, specifically when creating or querying tickets.
- Malicious scripts can be injected through parameters such as the ticket ID or username.
- The server reflects the unsanitized input back in the response when rejecting the request.

- An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code in a user's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, stealing user credentials, or performing unauthorized actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The malicious script is embedded within a parameter of the request.
