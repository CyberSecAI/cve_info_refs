The provided content relates to CVE-2021-42045.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of the User-Agent and X-Forwarded-For HTTP headers when displaying voter information in the SecurePoll extension.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the failure to escape HTML special characters in the User-Agent and X-Forwarded-For headers before displaying them in the "list of votes" page of the SecurePoll extension. This allows for a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code through these headers. When an administrator views the vote list, the injected script executes in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to:
    - Steal administrator session cookies
    - Perform actions on behalf of the administrator
    - Redirect the admin to a malicious website
    - Access sensitive information

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves crafting a malicious User-Agent or X-Forwarded-For header that contains JavaScript code. This can be done when submitting a vote in a poll.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to submit a vote to a SecurePoll instance. An attacker does not need elevated permissions for the initial injection of the payload. However, to exploit the XSS, they need to be able to induce an administrator of the secure poll to view the 'list of votes' page for the poll where the malicious vote was cast.
