- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect authorization in Mendix Studio Pro applications. Specifically, the application does not properly control read access for certain client actions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Improper access control leading to information disclosure. An authenticated attacker can retrieve the `changedDate` attribute of arbitrary objects, regardless of read access permissions.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can gain unauthorized information about the modified date of objects within the application. The impact is limited to information disclosure.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks through client actions within the Mendix application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to the application. The attack complexity is high as it requires specific knowledge of the vulnerable actions.
