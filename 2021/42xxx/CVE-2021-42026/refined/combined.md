SUMMARY

Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read or write
access for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of
System.FileDocument objects or to retrieve the changedDate attribute of arbitrary objects.

Mendix has released updates for the affected product lines, recommends to update to the latest versions
and to redeploy the applications.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• In applications that were built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro: avoid using ﬁle documents

that contain sensitive information

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Mendix is a high productivity app platform that enables you to build and continuously improve mobile and
web applications at scale. The Mendix Platform is designed to accelerate enterprise app delivery across
your entire application development lifecycle, from ideation to deployment and operations.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-42025

Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control write access
for certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to manipulate the content of
System.FileDocument objects in some cases, regardless whether they have write access to it.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-42026

Applications built with affected versions of Mendix Studio Pro do not properly control read access for
certain client actions. This could allow authenticated attackers to retrieve the changedDate attribute of
arbitrary objects, even when they don’t have read access to them.
