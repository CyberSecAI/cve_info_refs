Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42836:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the use of the `match.Match` function within the `gjson` library. This function is susceptible to regular expression denial-of-service (ReDoS) attacks when processing crafted JSON inputs with specific patterns.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **ReDoS vulnerability:** The `match.Match` function, used for pattern matching, does not limit the complexity of the input pattern, allowing attackers to craft inputs that cause the matching algorithm to run for an excessively long time.
- **Lack of input sanitization or complexity limits:**  The `gjson` library did not implement proper checks or limits on the complexity of the patterns used in "like" queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):**  By sending specially crafted JSON inputs to `gjson.Get`, an attacker could cause the application to become unresponsive or consume excessive resources, leading to a denial-of-service condition. The processing of the malicious pattern would take an extremely long time and consume excessive CPU resources.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted JSON Input:** The attacker needs to provide a JSON input with a malicious pattern designed to trigger the ReDoS vulnerability in the `match.Match` function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply arbitrary JSON input to the `gjson.Get` function, or to an application using the `gjson` library.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when using the `%` operator in a path, which performs a "like" query using the `match.Match` function.
- The provided exploit examples include:
  - `#[%"*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,*,,,,,,""*,*"]`
  - `#[%"*?**?**?**?**?**?***?**?**?**?**?*"""]`
- The fix involved replacing `match.Match` with `match.MatchLimit`, which adds a limit to the complexity of the match operation and prevents ReDos attacks.
- The vulnerability was addressed in commit `77a57fda87dca6d0d7d4627d512a630f89a91c96`, and the fix was included in version 1.9.3 of the `gjson` library.
- Commit `590010fdac311cc8990ef5c97448d4fec8f29944` updated the `match` dependency to address the ReDos vulnerability in the underlying `match` library.
- The vulnerability was initially reported in issues #236 and #237 of the `gjson` GitHub repository.
