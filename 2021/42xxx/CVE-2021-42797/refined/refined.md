Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42797:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The CISA advisory (ICS Advisory ICSA-22-326-01) explicitly mentions CVE-2021-42797 as one of the vulnerabilities affecting AVEVA Edge, confirming the content's relevance.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is a path traversal issue related to Windows UNC (Universal Naming Convention) share paths. Specifically, the AVEVA Edge software can be tricked into disclosing a Windows access token of the user account configured for accessing external database resources.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Path Traversal:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize paths, allowing an attacker to manipulate the path used for accessing external database resources using UNC share paths. This can lead to the disclosure of sensitive access tokens.
*   **Exposure of Sensitive Information:** The vulnerability results in the exposure of Windows access tokens, which can be leveraged to gain unauthorized access to resources.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can gain access to the Windows access token of the user account configured to access external databases used by the AVEVA Edge runtime.
*   **Potential Lateral Movement:** Depending on the permissions associated with the disclosed token, an attacker could potentially gain access to other systems and resources within the network.

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely over the network.
*   **Unauthenticated:** The attack does not require prior authentication.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target system running a vulnerable version of AVEVA Edge.
*   **No Credentials Required:** The attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit this vulnerability.

**Summary of CVE-2021-42797:**
The vulnerability is a path traversal issue via UNC share paths that allows an unauthenticated attacker to trick AVEVA Edge runtime into disclosing a Windows access token of the configured user account for accessing external DB resources. This can be exploited remotely. The impact is information disclosure of an access token which could lead to further compromise.
