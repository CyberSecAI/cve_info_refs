{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the LZ4 decompression algorithm within ClickHouse, where a user-supplied offset is used in a copy operation without proper bounds checking.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Heap out-of-bounds read"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can trigger a heap out-of-bounds read, potentially leading to denial of service (crash) or information leakage by reading sensitive memory contents. The vulnerability can also cause remote code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker sends a malicious query to the ClickHouse server with a specially crafted compressed payload. The server uses the LZ4 decompression algorithm to process this data, which triggers the vulnerability.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs valid credentials to connect to the ClickHouse server. Read permissions are sufficient to trigger the vulnerability, meaning even a low-privileged user can exploit it. The attacker needs the ability to send crafted queries to the ClickHouse server."
