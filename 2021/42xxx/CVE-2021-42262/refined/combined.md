## What is OPC UA?

OPC is short for “Open Platform Communications”. UA stands for “Unified Architecture”. OPC UA is an interoperability standard that was developed specifically for secure and reliable data exchange with Industry 4.0 and IoT applications. OPC UA offers considerable advantages for these applications, enabling platform-independent, secure, and scalable communication between industrial devices and systems. OPC UA standardizes data formats and protocols at the interface between various components and offers comprehensive security functions to protect communication.

## These are the benefits:

![Platform independence](/fileadmin/_processed_/c/6/csm_Benefits_200x200px_1_7ebe7de70e.jpg "Platform independence")

#### Platform independence:

OPC UA offers platform-independent, standardized communication between different systems, regardless of manufacturer or technical environment.

![Security](/fileadmin/_processed_/1/0/csm_Benefits_200x200px_2_a9e2a36fb2.jpg "Security")

#### Security:

OPC UA provides encryption, authentication and authorization to ensure that data remains confidential and can only be read by authorized persons or systems. Users can therefore be sure that their data is protected.

![Flexibility and scalability](/fileadmin/_processed_/5/a/csm_Benefits_200x200px_3_b49ea5cade.jpg "Flexibility and scalability")

#### Flexibility and scalability:

OPC UA supports a wide variety of transport protocols, from TCP/IP to HTTPS and MQTT. This means that the OPC UA interface can be used in many different applications and devices to ensure that the data arrives where it is needed. OPC UA systems can also be flexibly expanded to meet new requirements, either by adding new devices or by adapting to growing data volumes.

![Standardization](/fileadmin/_processed_/3/2/csm_Benefits_200x200px_4_25ffafaccc.jpg "Standardization")

#### Standardization:

OPC UA was developed and is maintained by the OPC Foundation to ensure an interoperable communication standard. To cover industry-specific requirements, the OPC Foundation works with members on the development of Companion Specifications that go beyond the basic standard. These Specifications ensure consistency and compatibility and facilitate the use of OPC UA and the integration of a wide range of system components in industrial scenarios.

## How does OPC UA communication work?

OPC UA communication works on the basis of a client-server or publisher-subscriber model (pub/sub model) and uses a serviceoriented architecture (SOA).

![Client-server model](/fileadmin/_processed_/a/3/csm_Client-Server_Modell_580x275px_2f8c37cc05.jpg "Client-server model")

#### Client-server model:

The OPC UA server provides data that can be retrieved and updated by OPC UA clients. Communication takes place via defined services such as reading, writing, subscribing to data changes and alarms. This means that clients can always access current data and react to changes, which ensures reliable and timely data communication.

![Publisher-subscriber model](/fileadmin/_processed_/2/a/csm_Publisher-Subscriber_Modell_580x275px_67e19a0949.jpg "Publisher-subscriber model")

#### Publisher-subscriber model:

The publisher sends data to one or more subscribers. The subscribers receive data from the publisher. This model is particularly suitable for scenarios in which data needs to be distributed to multiple recipients in real time.

## How can OPC UA be used for data integration with Industry 4.0 and IoT applications?

There are several typical scenarios and project situations in which OPC UA is used at the interface between OT and IT:

#### 1. Modernization of legacy systems through OPC UA integration

Many machines and devices in legacy systems do not have a standardized OPC UA interface and use older communication protocols or proprietary interfaces instead. In modernization projects, it is often necessary to integrate these machines and devices into innovative solutions via OPC UA to take advantage of Industry 4.0 and IoT applications and ensure effective data integration.

#### 2. Efficient connection and integration of OPC UA servers in modern facilities

In modern systems, many devices are already equipped with integrated OPC UA servers. The challenge here is to connect the applications efficiently, easily and securely to a large number of data sources. In addition, there is often a need to allow applications to access data from OPC UA servers via standard protocols commonly used in the IT world, such as MQTT.

#### 3. Standardization and integration through Companion Specifications and OPC UA information models

In modern facilities, there is a growing need for the use of Companion Specifications or OPC UA Information Models. They standardize interfaces for devices, machines and systems, including semantic information, and facilitate their integration into innovative IoT solutions, for example via Unified Name Spaces (UNS).

## Adapting OPC UA solutions to individual operating processes and infrastructures

All the requirements and application scenarios can usually be covered with standard products that support OPC UA and minimize project-specific integration efforts.

However, because users differ in terms of organization, operational processes, and existing infrastructure, the optimal choice for adapting an OPC UA-based data integration solution to a specific organization may vary. Depending on the circumstances, Docker-based software solutions, Windows-based software solutions, or hardware solutions are the most suitable options.

## Softing OPC UA expertise and portfolio

Softing OPC UA expertise and portfolio With our extensive experience in OPC technology and close collaboration with the OPC Foundation, we are the ideal partner for your OPC data integration needs. Whether for legacy systems or new installations, and whether supporting traditional operations or IT-driven and automated processes, Softing Industrial offers tailored end-user products for OPC UA-based data integration.

In addition to these end-user products, we develop and market Software Development Kits (SDKs) for project-specific development of OPC UA client and server components. These SDKs can be used for both device and software applications. We are also utilizing these SDKs in the development of our OPC UA-based end-user products. The synergies created by this approach benefit both the users of our end-user products and the users of the SDKs.

Complementing our standard products, we offer a comprehensive training and service program to provide our customers with the best possible support.
