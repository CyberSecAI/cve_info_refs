{
  "CVE-2021-42794": {
    "description": "AVEVA Edge versions R2020 and prior could allow internal network scanning and expose sensitive device information.",
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to connection string parameter pollution, allowing modification of database connection parameters.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper input validation of connection string parameters",
       "Lack of sanitization of user-supplied inputs",
      "Vulnerability to parameter pollution attacks"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform internal network scanning and potentially gain access to sensitive information by exploiting the parameter pollution vulnerability.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "The attacker injects malicious parameters into the connection string by appending them with a semicolon (;).",
       "The attacker modifies parameters such as 'Data Source' or 'Integrated Security' to redirect the connection to a malicious server or use the application's system account instead of provided user credentials."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker requires the ability to manipulate input fields that are used to construct the database connection string. No authentication is needed.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability allows for several types of attacks:\n\n*   **Hash Stealing:** Redirecting the database connection to a rogue server controlled by the attacker to capture user credentials.\n*   **Port Scanning:** Using the application to scan internal networks by attempting connections to different ports and analyzing the error messages.\n*   **Hijacking Web Credentials:** Overwriting the 'Integrated Security' parameter to force the application to connect to the database using the web application's system account, potentially granting the attacker access to sensitive data and system control."
