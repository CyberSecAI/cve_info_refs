Abstract.  In  2007  the  ranking  of  the  top  ten  critical  vulnerabilities  for  the
security  of  a  system  established code  injection  as  the  top 2,  closely  following
top 1 XSS attacks. The first release candidate of the 2010 version of the ranking
has promoted code injection attacks to top 1. Actually, the most critical attacks
are  those  that  combine  XSS  techniques  to  access  systems  and  code  injection
techniques to access the information. The potential damage associated with this
kind of threats, the total absence of background and the fact that the solution to
mitigate  these  vulnerabilities  must  be  worked  together  with  programmers,
systems  administrators  and  database  vendors  justifies  an  in-depth  analysis  to
estimate all the possible ways of implementing this technique.

Keywords:  Code  injection  attacks,  connection  strings,  web  application
authentication delegation.

1   Introduction

SQL injections are probably the most known injection attacks to web applications by
abusing  its  database  architecture.  Many  different  approaches  and  techniques  have
been studied and analyzed so far, and the published results conclude that to prevent
these attacks from being successful, development teams need to establish the correct
filtering levels on the inputs to the system.

In  the  case  of  the  attack  presented  in  this  paper,  responsibility  lays  not  only  on
developers,  but  also  on  system  administrators  and  database  vendors.  This  attack
affects  web  applications,  but  instead  of  abusing  implementation  flaws  in  the  way
database  queries  are  crafted,  which  is  the  most  commonly  found  scenario  on  other
injection attacks, it abuses the way applications connect to the database.

According to OWASP [1], in 2007 the ranking of the top ten critical vulnerabilities
for  the  security  of  a  system  established  code  injection  attacks  as  the  top  2,  closely
following  top  1  XSS  attacks.  The  first  release  candidate  of  the  2010  version  of  the
ranking  has  promoted  code  injection  attacks  to  top  1.  Actually,  the  most  critical
attacks are those that combine XSS techniques to access systems and code injection
techniques  to  access  the  information.  This  is  the  case  for  the  so-called  connection
string parameter pollution attacks. Potential impact of this type of  vulnerability and
the  total  absence  of  background  justify  an  in-depth  analysis  to  estimate  all  possible
attack vectors using this technique.

This paper is structured is in three main sections. The first is this short introduction
where  the  foundations  of  the  connection  strings  and  existing  mechanisms  for  the
implementation  of  web  applications  authentication  will  be  introduce.  Section  two
proposes  a  comprehensive  study  of  this  new  attack  technique,  with  an  extensive
collection of test cases. The article concludes briefly summarizing the lessons learned.

1.1   Connections Strings

Connection  strings  [2]  are  used  to  connect  applications  to  database  engines.  The
syntax used on these strings depends on the database engine to be connected to and on
the provider or driver used by the programmer to establish the connection.

One way or another, the programmer must specify the server and port to connect
to, the database name, authentication credentials, and some connection configuration
parameters,  such  as  timeout,  alternative  databases,  communication  protocol  or
encryption options.

The  following  example  shows  a  common  connection  string  used  to  connect  to  a

Microsoft SQL Server database:

“Data Source=Server,Port; Network Library=DBMSSOCN;
Initial Catalog=DataBase; User ID=Username;
Password=pwd;”

As the example shows, a connection string is a collection of parameters separated
by  semicolons (;), each parameter being a  key-value pair. The attributes  used in the
example correspond to the ones used in the “.NET Framework Data Provider for SQL
Server”, which is chosen by programmers when they use the “SqlConnection” class in
their  .NET  applications.  Obviously,  it  is  possible  to  connect  to  SQL  Server  using
different providers such as:

“.NET Framework Data Provider for OLE DB” (OleDbConnection)
“.NET Framework Data Provider for ODBC” (OdbcConnection)
“SQL Native Client 9.0 OLE DB provider”

-
-
-
The  most  common  and  recommended  way  to  connect  a  .NET  based  application
and  a  SQL  server,  is  to  use  the  framework  default  provider,  where  the  connection
string  syntax  is  the  same  regardless  the  different  versions  of  SQL  Server  (7,  2000,
2005 and 2008). This is the one used in this article to illustrate the examples.

1.2   Web Application authentication delegation

There are two ways of defining an authentication system for a web application: create
an own credential system, or delegate it to the database engine.
In most cases, the application developer chooses to use only one user to connect to the
database.  Seen  from  the  database  side,  this  database  user  represents  the  entire  web
application. Using this connection, the web application will make queries to a custom
users table where the user credentials for the application are stored.

Database engine

Web application

Fig. 1. Common web application authentication architecture

The web application is identified by a single database user with access to the entire
application  content  in  the  database,  thus  it  is  impossible  to  implement  a  granular
permission system in the database over the different object, or to trace the actions of
each user in the web application, delegating these tasks to the web application itself.
If  an  attacker  is  able  to  abuse  some  vulnerability  in  the  application  to  access  the
database, the whole database will be exposed. This architecture is very common, and
can be found in widely used CMS systems such as Joomla, Mambo and many others.
Usually, the target of the attacker is to get the application users credentials from the
users table in the database.

The alternative consists in delegating the authentication to the database engine, so
that the connection string does not contain a fixed set of credentials, but will use those
entered  by  the  application  user  and  it  is  the  database  engine  responsibility  to  check
them.

Database  management  applications  always  use  this  delegated  authentication,  so
that  the  user  connecting  to  the  application  will  only  be  able  to  access  and  control
those  objects  and  actions  for  which  he  has  permissions.  With  this  architecture,  it  is
possible  to  implement  a  granular  permission  system  and  to  trace  user  actions  in  the
database.

Fig. 2. Web application delegated authentication architecture.

Both  methods  offer  different  advantages  and  disadvantages,  apart  from  the  ones
already  mentioned,  which  are  outside  the  scope  of  this  article.  The  techniques
described in this paper will focus on the second environment: web applications with
delegated authentication to the database engine.

2   Connection String Injection

In  a  delegated  authentication  environment  connection  string  injection  techniques
allow  an  attacker  to  inject  parameters  by  appending  them  with  the  semicolon  (;)
character.

In an example where the user is asked to enter a username and a password to create
a  connection  string,  an  attacker  can  void  the  encrypting  system  by  entering  a
password such as "pwd; Encryption=off", resulting in a connection string like:

“Data Source=Server,Port; Network Library=DBMSSOCN;
Initial Catalog=DataBase; User ID=Username;
Password=pwd; Encryption=off”

When the connection string is populated, the Encryption value will be added to the

previously configured set of parameters.

2.1   Connection String Builder in .NET

to

create

Aware  of  this  exploitation  [3]  of  the  connection  strings,  Microsoft  included  the
“ConnectionStringBuilder” [4] classes on it's version 2.0 of the Framework. They are
meant
class
(DbConnectionStringBuilder)  or  through  the  specific  classes  for  the  different
providers  (SqlConnectionStringBuilder,  OleDbConnectionStringBuilder,  etc…),  and
they  achieve  this  by  allowing  just  key-value  pairs  for  attributes  and  by  escaping
injection attempts.

strings

the

The  use  of  these  classes  when  creating  a  connection  string  would  prevent  the

injections. However, not every developer or application uses them.

2.2   Connection String Parameter Pollution

Parameter  pollution  techniques  are  used  to  override  values  on  parameters.  They  are
well  known  in  the  HTTP  [5]  environment  but  they  are  also  applicable  to  other
environments.  In  this  example,  parameter  pollution  techniques  can  be  applied  to
parameters in the connection string, allowing several attacks.

2.3   Connection String Parameter Pollution (CSPP) Attacks

As  an  example  scenario  to  illustrate  these  attacks,  a  web  application  where  a  user
[User_Value] and a password [Password_Value] are required is served by a Microsoft
Internet  Information  Services  web  server  running  on  a  Microsoft  Windows  Server.
The application user credentials are going to be used to create a connection string to a
Microsoft SQL Server database as follows:

Data source = SQL2005; initial catalog = db1;
integrated security=no; user id=+’User_Value’+;
Password=+’Password_Value’+;

This connection string shows how the application is connecting to a Microsoft SQL
Server database engine. Knowing this, and attacker can perform a Connection String
Parameter  Pollution  Attack.  The  idea  of  this  attack  is  to  add  a  parameter  to  the
connection string with the desired value, regardless of if it already was in the string or
the value with which was set up. The component used by .NET applications to craft
the connection string will use the value of the last occurrence of the parameter in the
connection  string.  If  the  connection  string  has  two  parameters  which  key  is  "Data
Source", the value used will be the one of the last of the two pairs, which allows the
following CSPP attack vectors:

2.3.1   CSPP Attack 1: Hash stealing
An attacker can place a Rogue Microsoft SQL Server connected to the Internet with a
Microsoft SQL Server credential sniffer listening (In this exsmple CAIN [6] has been
used). An attacker would perform a CSPP attack as follows:

User_Value:    ; Data Source = Rogue_Server

Password_Value:   ; Integrated Security = true

Resulting in the following connecting string:

Data source = SQL2005; initial catalog = db1;
integrated security=no; user id=;Data Source=Rogue
Server; Password=; Integrated Security=true;

The  "Data  Source"  and  "Integrated  Security"  parameters  are  being  overridden  so
that the Microsoft SQL Server native drivers  will  use the last set of values ignoring
the  previous  ones,  and  the  application  will  try  to  connect  to  Rogue_Server  with  the
Windows  credentials  it's  running  on,  which  can  be  either  a  system  user  or  an
application pool user.

2.3.1.1   Example 1: ASP.NET Enterprise Manager
This tool is an abandoned and unsupported Open Source tool, but still being used by
some  hosting  companies  and  some  organizations  to  manage  Microsoft  SQL  Server
databases  via  a  web
to  be
aspnetenterprisemanager.com, is today abandoned, but the tool can be obtained from
several other web sites like SourceForge [7] or MyOpenSource [8]. This tool is being
recommended in a lot of forums as a good ASP.NET alternative to PHPMyAdmin [9],
even though the last version was published on the 3rd of January of 2003.

interface.  The  official  web  site,  which  used

The results are collected on the rogue server where the database connection sniffer

has been installed giving access to the LM Hash of the account.

Fig. 4. Hash collected in the rogue server with Cain

2.3.2   CSPP Attack 2: Port scanning
One  of  the  valid  parameters  on  a  connection  string  is  the  port  to  connect  to.  An
attacker can abuse an application vulnerable to this technique to network scan servers
by trying to connect to different ports and see the error messages obtained:

User_Value:      ; Data Source =Target_Server,
Target_Port

Password_Value:     ; Integrated Security = true

This injection attack will result in the following connection string:

Data source = SQL2005; initial catalog = db1;
integrated security=no; user id=;Data Source=Target
Server, Target Port; Password=; Integrated
Security=true;

This  connection  string  will  ignore  the  first  instance  of  the  first  "Data  Source"
parameter and will use the last one, meaning that the web application is going to try to
connect  to  "Target  Port"  port  on  the  "Target  Server"  machine.  Observing  the
differences in the returned error messages, a port scan can be performed.

2.3.2.1   Example 2: myLittleAdmin and myLittleBackup

The  tools  myLittleAdmin  [10]  and  myLittleBackup  [11]  are  commercial  tools
developed  by  myLittleTools  [12].  Both  tools  are  vulnerable  to  CSPP  attacks  up  to
versions myLittleAdmin 3.5 and myLittleBackup 1.6.

Fig. 5. A connection can be established through port 80 to www.gooogle.com

As shown in Fig. 5, when the port is listening (open) the error message obtained says
that no Microsoft SQL Server is listening on it, but a TCP connection was established.

Fig. 6. A connection cannot be established through the XX port to www.google.com

When the port is closed, a TCP connection could not be completed and the error
message is different. Using these error messages a complete TCP port scan can be run
against a server. Of course, this technique can also be used to discover internal servers
within the DMZ where the web application is hosted.

2.3.3   CSPP Attack 3: Hijacking Web credentials
This  time  the  attacker  tries  to  connect  to  the  database  by  using  the  web  application
system account instead of a user provided set of credentials:

User_Value:    ; Data Source =Target_Server

Password_Value:   ; Integrated Security = true

These injected values will result in the following connection string:

Data source = SQL2005; initial catalog = db1;
integrated security=no; user id=;Data Source=Target
Server, Target Port; Password=; Integrated
Security=true;

This  time  is  the  "integrated  security"  parameter  what  is  being  overwritten  with  a
"True" value. This means that the system will try to connect to the database with the
system account which the tool is running with. In this case this is the system account
used by the web application in the web server.

2.3.3.1   Example 3: SQL Server Web Data Administrator
This tool is a project, originally developed by Microsoft, which was made free as an
Open  Project.  Today,  it  is  still  possible  to  download  the  last  version  that  Microsoft
released on 2004 from Microsoft Servers [13] but the latest one, released on 2007, is
hosted in the Codeplex web site [14]. The version hosted in Codeplex is secure to this
type of attacks because it is using the ConnectionStringBuilder classes to dynamically
construct the connection string.

The version published on the Microsoft web site is vulnerable to CSPP attacks. The
following screenshots show  how it is possible to get access to the system  using this
type of attack.

Fig. 7. Exploiting the credentials at the WEB Data Administrator

In  Fig.  7,  the  password  value  is:  “;  integrated  Security=true”,  as  described

previously.

Fig. 8. Console access with the server account

The  attacker  can  log  into  the  web  application  to  manage  the  whole  system.  As
shown  in  Fig.  9,  this  is  because  all  users  and  network  services  have  access  to  the
server.

Fig. 9. System account access grant.

2.3.3.2   Example 4: myLittleAdmin and myLittleBackup
In mylittleAdmin and myLittlebackup tools, it is possible to check out the connection
string used to get the access. Looking at it, the parameter pollution injected in order to
obtain access to the system can be clearly seen.

Fig. 10. CSPP in myLittleAdmin.

Fig. 10 shows how the "Data Source" parameter, after the "User ID" parameter, has
been injected with the localhost value. This parameter, "Data Source", is also the first
one of the connection string. Their values are different but the one that is being used
is the last one, i.e. the injected one.

Same happens with the "Integrated Security" parameter that appears initially with
the  no  value  but  then  is  overriden  by  the  one  injected  in  the  password  value  with
value  yes,  resulting  in  a  total  access  to  the  server  with  the  system  account  the  web
application is running as.

Fig. 11. Querying the master..sysusers table.

2.3.3.3   Example 5: ASP.NET Enterprise Manager

The same attack also  works  on the latest public  version of the  ASP.NET Enterprise
manager, so, as can be seen in the following login form, an attacker can perform the
CSPP injection to get access to the web application.

Fig. 12. CSPP in ASP.NET Enterprise Manager login form.

And  as  a  result  of  it,  full  access  can  be  obtained,  just  as  can  be  seen  in  the

following screenshot.

Fig. 13. Administration console in ASP.NET Enterprise Manager.

3   Conclusions

All  these  examples  show  the  importance  of  filtering  any  user  input  in  web
applications.  Moreover,  these  examples  are  a  clear  proof  of  the  importance  of
maintaining  the  software  updated.  Microsoft  released  ConnectionStringbuilder  in

order  to  avoid  these  kinds  of  attacks,  but  not  all  projects were  updated  to  use  these
new and secure components.

These  techniques  also  apply  to  other  database  engines  such  as  Oracle  databases,
which allow administrators to set up Integrated security into the database. Besides, in
Oracle  connection  strings  it  is  possible  to  change  the  way  a  user  gets  connected  by
forcing the use of a sysdba session.

MySQL databases do not allow administrators to configure an Integrated Security
authentication  process.  However,  it  is  still  possible  to  inject  code  and  manipulate
connection  strings  to  try  to  connect  against  internal  servers  not  exposed  to  the
Internet.

In order to avoid these attacks the semicolon character must be filtered out, all the
parameters sanitized, and the firewall be hardened in order to filter not only inbound
connections  but  also  prevent  outbound  connections  from  internal  servers  that  are
sending NTLM credentials to the internet. Databases administrator should also apply
a hardening process in the database engine to restrict access by a minimum privilege
policy.

AVEVA Edge versions R2020 and prior could allow unauthenticated arbitrary commands to be executed with the security context of the StADOSvr.exe process. In most instances, this will be a standard-privileged user account under which the AVEVA Edge runtime was started. It's possible for a high-privileged service account to have been configured and assigned for running AVEVA Edge runtime.

[CVE-2021-42796](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42796) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H)).

**3.2.4 [PATH TRAVERSAL: '\\UNC\SHARE\NAME\' (WINDOWS UNC SHARE) CWE-40](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/40.html)**

AVEVA Edge versions R2020 and prior could allow an unauthenticated actor to trick the AVEVA Edge runtime into disclosing a Windows access token of the user account configured for accessing external DB resources.

[CVE-2021-42797](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-42797) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 8.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:N/A:N)).

## 4. MITIGATIONS

AVEVA recommends organizations evaluate the impact of these vulnerabilities based on operational environment, architecture, and product implementations.

* Users of AVEV Edge (formerly known as InduSoft Web Studio) up to 2020 R2 SP1 w/ HF 2020.2.00.40 should apply [AVEVA Edge 2020 R2 SP2](https://softwaresupportsp.aveva.com/#/producthub/details?id=bd805851-0c68-4343-15ee-08da9a4aa617) as soon as possible.
* Restrict access to port TCP/3997

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of this vulnerability these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from business networks.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/ics/Recommended-Practices) on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics). Several CISA products detailing cyber defense best practices are available for reading and download, including Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with [Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://us-cert.cisa.gov/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the ICS webpage at [cisa.gov/ics](https://cisa.gov/ics) in the technical information paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing suspected malicious activity should follow established internal procedures and report findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
