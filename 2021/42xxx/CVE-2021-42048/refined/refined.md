    "Impact": "An attacker with admin privileges can inject arbitrary JavaScript code, potentially leading to malicious actions such as cookie theft, session hijacking, or defacement of the website for new users.",
    "Attack vectors": "The attack vector involves an administrator with the ability to edit the MediaWiki:growthexperiments-homepage-impact-unactivated-suggested-edits-footer page.",
