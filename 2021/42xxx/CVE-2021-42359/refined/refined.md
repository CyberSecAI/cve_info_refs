- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin's AJAX action `admin-dismiss-unsubscribe`, intended for administrators to dismiss data removal requests, was accessible to unauthenticated users. The plugin also failed to validate whether the post to be deleted was actually a data removal request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - **Unauthenticated access:** The AJAX action could be triggered by any user, not just administrators.
    - **Lack of input validation:** The plugin did not verify if the post ID provided was a data removal request before attempting to delete it.
    - **Direct object reference:** The plugin used the post ID directly to perform delete operations without proper validation, allowing access to any post or page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker could delete arbitrary posts and pages on the website. A single request would move the post to trash, and subsequent requests would permanently delete it. This could lead to complete site content loss, requiring restoration from backups.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability was exploited by sending an AJAX request to the `admin-dismiss-unsubscribe` action, along with the post ID of the content to be deleted.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs no special privileges to exploit the vulnerability, and can be any site visitor.
