Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which corresponds to CVE-2021-42165:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the improper handling of special characters within the `deviceinfo show file` command of the MitraStar GPT-2541GNAC-N1 router's restricted CLI. Specifically, the command does not sanitize or validate user-supplied input for the `path` parameter, allowing for command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The `deviceinfo show file` command is vulnerable to command injection via the `path` parameter.
- Insufficient Input Validation: The router's restricted CLI fails to properly sanitize user-provided input.
- Privilege Escalation: Exploiting this command injection allows an attacker to bypass the restricted shell and execute arbitrary commands with root privileges.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege Escalation: Attackers gain full root access to the router's operating system.
- System Compromise: Attackers can modify system files, create new users, change passwords, and potentially install malicious software.
- Full Control of Router: The router is fully compromised and can be used as a point for further attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The exploit can be triggered remotely via an SSH connection to the router.
- Restricted CLI: The attacker interacts with the router through the limited shell environment provided by the device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network access to the router (e.g., local network or internet access if the SSH port is exposed).
- SSH Credentials: The attacker needs valid SSH credentials for the router. Default credentials may be used, or those printed on the router's label.
- Familiarity with Command Injection: The attacker needs to know that `deviceinfo show file` allows command injection.

**Technical Details:**
The specific exploit involves injecting a second command via the `path` parameter of the `deviceinfo show file` command. The injection string `&&/bin/bash` allows the attacker to execute the `bash` shell, which runs with root privileges.

**Exploit Example:**
```
deviceinfo show file &&/bin/bash
```

This command, when executed through the router's restricted CLI, will spawn a full bash shell with root privileges, granting full control over the device to the attacker.

The content provides more detail than the official CVE description by demonstrating:
- The exact command to inject (`&&/bin/bash`)
- The specific vulnerable command (`deviceinfo show file`)
- Impact including privilege escalation to root
- The device is vulnerable via SSH
- The fact that default credentials may apply, easing exploitation
