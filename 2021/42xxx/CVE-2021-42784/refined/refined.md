- **Root cause of vulnerability**:
    - **Exploit 1**: Lack of authentication in the `debug_post_set.cgi` script.
    - **Exploit 2**: Command injection vulnerability in the `debug_fcgi` script.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Authentication bypass.
    - Command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - **Exploit 1**: A remote attacker can perform administrative actions without authentication.
    - **Exploit 2**: A remote attacker can perform command injection.
    - Overall, the vulnerabilities enable Remote Code Execution (RCE).
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Crafted HTTP requests targeting the vulnerable `debug_post_set.cgi` and `debug_fcgi` scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    - The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the device, which implies network access to the vulnerable device. No authentication is required for the first exploit. The second exploit is an authenticated command injection issue.
