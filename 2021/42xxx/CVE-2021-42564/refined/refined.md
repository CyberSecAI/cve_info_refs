- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Insufficient input sanitization in the Cryptshare web application when handling user-provided content within confidential messages. Specifically, the application does not properly sanitize HTML input, allowing the injection of malicious HTML tags.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Open Redirect (CWE-601) through HTML injection. The application allows the insertion of meta tags within confidential messages that redirect users to a different URL.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can redirect a recipient to an arbitrary webpage, potentially for phishing or other malicious purposes.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker crafts a malicious confidential message containing HTML meta tags designed for redirection. This crafted message is sent through Cryptshare to a target recipient.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to send confidential messages through the Cryptshare web application, and has the ability to manipulate the content of the message. The attacker also needs knowledge of HTML to craft the malicious payload.
