Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42557:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a type juggling issue in the `jeedom::apiAccess` function within the Jeedom home automation software. The function uses a loose comparison (`==`) instead of a strict comparison (`===`) when verifying API keys.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Type Juggling:** The use of `==` allows for type coercion, meaning an integer `0` can be loosely equal to a string API key.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** By providing an integer `0` as the API key, an attacker can bypass the authentication check within the `jeedom::apiAccess` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized API Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to bypass authentication and gain access to the Jeedom API.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The attacker can use the API to retrieve sensitive information, including user credentials such as usernames and passwords (including http and ssh credentials).
*   **Remote Command Execution:** Through the API and the web interface, a remote attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the web server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:** The attack is performed by sending crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/core/api/proApi.php` or `/core/api/jeeApi.php` endpoints.
*   **API Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates the `apikey`, `api`, or `proapi` parameters in the POST request by setting them to the integer `0`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the Jeedom server.
*   **No Prior Credentials:** The attacker does not need a valid API key to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided content indicates that this vulnerability affects Jeedom versions 4.1.26 and below, and is fixed in version 4.1.27.
*   The vulnerability was discovered by Synacktiv.
*   The report notes that thousands of Jeedom applications are exposed on the internet according to shodan.io and fofa.so, increasing the potential attack surface.
*   The advisory recommends using the strict comparison operator (`===`) to prevent the type juggling issue.

**Summary:** This is a critical vulnerability that allows an attacker to completely bypass authentication and gain control of a Jeedom system. The combination of API access and command execution makes it a high-severity issue.
