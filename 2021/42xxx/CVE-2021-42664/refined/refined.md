Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information relevant to CVE-2021-42664:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

*   The content explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-42664 - Stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability in the Engineers online portal system".
*   It also references external links to Exploit-DB, MITRE, and NIST which confirm the vulnerability.
*   The provided information aligns with the description of a stored XSS vulnerability.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input within the Engineers online portal system.
*   Specifically, the application fails to neutralize or escape HTML metacharacters (`<`, `>`, `"` etc.) in the "quiz\_title" and "description" parameters before storing and displaying them, thus allowing for the injection of malicious scripts.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   The primary weakness is a **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability.
*  The application fails to properly handle and sanitize user-provided input, specifically the `quiz_title` and `description` fields in the `add_quiz.php` page.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker could inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the vulnerable fields.
*   This could lead to:
    *   **Cookie stealing:** An attacker could steal session cookies of users accessing the vulnerable page, potentially allowing them to impersonate legitimate users.
    *   **Defacement:** The attacker could modify the content of the web page, presenting misleading or malicious information to users.
    *  **Run javascript on the web server surfers behalf**: This allows to potentially perform a wide range of actions on behalf of the victim.
    *   Other malicious actions that can be performed via javascript (e.g., redirecting to malicious sites).

**5. Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the web interface of the "Engineers Online Portal".
*   The specific vulnerable page is `add_quiz.php` (and `edit_quiz.php` which shares the same vulnerability).
*   The attack involves injecting malicious JavaScript code into the vulnerable parameters: "quiz\_title" or "description".

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Attacker capabilities:**
    *   Basic knowledge of web security and XSS vulnerabilities.
    *   Ability to craft a malicious JavaScript payload.
    *   Ability to make HTTP requests to the web server, either directly or through a web browser.
*   **Attacker position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to access the applicationâ€™s `add_quiz.php` page.
    *   No special privileges needed other than an ability to submit data through the web interface.

**Additional Technical Details (Beyond CVE Description):**

*   The provided proof-of-concept (PoC) uses a simple JavaScript `alert()` function as an example payload: `<script>alert("This is an XSS")</script>`.
*   The content from exploit-db.com provides more details such as:
    *   The vulnerable application: "Engineers Online Portal 1.0".
    *   The vendor's homepage and download link for the vulnerable application.
    *   The full HTTP POST request, which demonstrates how to exploit the vulnerability.
    *   A reference to `edit_quiz.php` as an alternative attack vector.
*   The content from github.com provides a link to a specific repository demonstrating the vulnerability with the full path to the vulnerable files and their content (`README.md`).

In summary, the content confirms a stored XSS vulnerability (CVE-2021-42664) in the Engineers Online Portal system, stemming from inadequate input sanitization of the "quiz\_title" and "description" parameters on the `add_quiz.php` page, which could result in various malicious activities when an attacker injects malicious javascript code. It also provides details beyond the official CVE description, such as the vulnerable application, the vulnerable parameters, a PoC, and exploit steps.
