Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-42052:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to a path traversal flaw in the `lib/js/build/STEResource.res` component of IPESA e-Flow 3.3.6.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Directory Traversal:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) in the `R` query parameter to access files outside of the intended web root directory.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can read arbitrary files within the web root directory. This could expose sensitive data, including configuration files, source code, and other confidential information.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Attack:** The vulnerability is exploitable remotely via HTTP requests.
*   **Path Traversal in 'R' Query Parameter:** The attacker includes directory traversal sequences in the `R` query parameter of the request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to be able to craft HTTP requests with the malicious path traversal sequence.

**Technical Details:**

*   **Affected Component:** `/lib/js/build/STEResource.res`
*   **Affected Product:** IPESA e-Flow - v.3.3.6
*   **Proof of Concept (PoC) URLs:**
    *   `https://example.tld/STE/lib/js/build/STEResource.res?R=../../../../../web.config`
    *   `https://example.tld/lib/js/build/STEResource.res?R=../../../../../web.config`
    These PoC URLs demonstrate how an attacker can read the `web.config` file by traversing up the directory tree.
