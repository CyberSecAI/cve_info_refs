- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Emulex HBA Manager/One Command Manager has a vulnerability in the remote firmware download feature that allows a user to place or replace an arbitrary file on the remote host.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities**: Improper file handling and lack of sufficient access control during remote firmware download.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can place or replace arbitrary files on the remote host, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, data modification, or denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Network-based attacks through the remote firmware download feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs network access to the Emulex HBA Manager and needs to exploit the remote firmware download feature. In non-secure mode, the user is unauthenticated.
