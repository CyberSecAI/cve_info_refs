### @AaronO **[AaronO](/AaronO)** commented [Sep 14, 2021](#issue-995910458) • edited Loading

Which could allow arbitrary code execution when parsing YAML files with the extended schema, e.g:

## Example of misuse

```
import { parse, EXTENDED_SCHEMA } from "https://deno.land/std/encoding/yaml.ts";

const data = parse(`
fun: !!js/function >
  console.log(Deno.core);
`, {schema: EXTENDED_SCHEMA});
console.log(data);
```

Will log `Deno.core`

## Proof of fix

```
import { parse, EXTENDED_SCHEMA } from "https://raw.githubusercontent.com/denoland/deno_std/security/yaml-func-exec/encoding/yaml.ts";

const data = parse(`
fun: !!js/function >
  console.log(Deno.core);
`, {schema: EXTENDED_SCHEMA});
console.log(data);
```

Will throw with `Uncaught YAMLError: unknown tag !<tag:yaml.org,2002:js/function> at line 4, column 1:`

## Notes

* Reported by [@Ry0taK](https://github.com/Ry0taK)
* Impact: high (allows arbitrary JS execution)
* Probability: low (requires using `EXTENDED_SCHEMA` which is uncommon) and parsing untrusted YAML files

Sorry, something went wrong.
