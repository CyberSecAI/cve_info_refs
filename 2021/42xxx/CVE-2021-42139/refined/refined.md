Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42139:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `encoding/yaml` module of Deno Standard Modules. It arises because the module allows the execution of arbitrary JavaScript code when parsing YAML files with the `EXTENDED_SCHEMA`. Specifically, the `!!js/function` tag within a YAML file can be used to inject and execute JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Code Injection: The primary weakness is the ability to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code by crafting malicious YAML files using the `!!js/function` tag.
- Unsafe YAML parsing: The `EXTENDED_SCHEMA` is not properly sanitized and allows the interpretation of the `!!js/function` tag, leading to code execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary JavaScript execution: An attacker can execute any arbitrary JavaScript code on the system where the vulnerable Deno application is running. This can lead to full system compromise, data theft, or other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious YAML file: An attacker can craft a malicious YAML file containing the `!!js/function` tag with arbitrary JavaScript code and provide this file to a vulnerable Deno application for parsing, if it uses `EXTENDED_SCHEMA`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a malicious YAML file to the vulnerable Deno application.
- The vulnerable Deno application must use the `encoding/yaml` module with `EXTENDED_SCHEMA` enabled during YAML parsing.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when parsing YAML files with the `EXTENDED_SCHEMA` option enabled, specifically when encountering the `!!js/function` tag.
- The issue was fixed in version 0.107.0 by disabling the parsing of the `!!js/function` tag.
- The probability of exploitation is considered low, as it requires using `EXTENDED_SCHEMA`, which is not a default setting, and also requires the parsing of untrusted YAML files.
