The provided content relates to CVE-2021-42668.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a SQL injection flaw in the `my_classmates.php` page of the Engineers Online Portal 1.0. The `id` parameter is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in `my_classmates.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Data extraction: An attacker can extract sensitive data from the database.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): The attacker can upload malicious code by exploiting an avatar vulnerability with directory traversal, leading to arbitrary code execution on the server.
- Complete system compromise: The attacker can bypass the admin account. Additionally the attacker can execute malicious code that can destroy files on the system.

**Attack vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through a crafted HTTP GET request to the `my_classmates.php` page with a malicious payload in the `id` parameter.
- The attacker can use the avatar upload functionality to upload malicious files.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication or special privileges are required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerability.
- Some knowledge of SQL is required to craft the injection payload.
