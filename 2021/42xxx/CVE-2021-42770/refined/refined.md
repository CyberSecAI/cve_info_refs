Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-42770:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled data from an LDAP directory within the OPNSense authentication tester. Specifically, when an administrator uses the authentication tester (System -> Access -> Tester), the application displays LDAP attributes fetched from the directory. These attributes are printed directly into the HTML output without proper encoding, enabling an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the web page.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS. User-controlled data from LDAP, specifically attribute values (`$attr_value`), is not sanitized before being displayed on the `diag_authentication.php` page.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application fails to sanitize user-controlled data, in this case, LDAP attributes before displaying them.
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The XSS vulnerability allows attackers to steal the CSRF token.
- **Improper Output Handling:** The application does not properly encode or sanitize output.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful XSS attack allows the execution of malicious JavaScript within the context of the administrator's session.
- **CSRF Token Theft:** The XSS can be used to steal the CSRF token used to perform administrative actions.
- **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can leverage the stolen CSRF token to execute administrative tasks, including creating new administrator accounts, disabling firewall rules, or shutting down the OPNSense system.
- **Complete System Compromise:** By gaining administrator access, an attacker can effectively take full control of the OPNSense firewall.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
- **LDAP Manipulation:** The attacker manipulates an LDAP user's attributes to inject malicious JavaScript code into LDAP attributes.
- **Authentication Tester:** An OPNSense administrator is lured into using the authentication tester function on OPNSense (System -> Access -> Tester). When this occurs, the malicious javascript is executed.
- **Exploitation via XSS:** The injected JavaScript, when rendered in the admin's browser, executes malicious code.
- **CSRF Token Theft and Replay:** The attacker collects the CSRF token from the XSS payload and uses it to send malicious requests to perform administrative functions.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **LDAP Access:** The attacker needs the ability to modify attributes of a user in the LDAP directory.
- **OPNSense Access:** The attacker needs knowledge that an OPNSense instance is connected to the LDAP directory, and knowledge of the `diag_authentication.php` page.
- **Admin Interaction:** The attacker needs an administrator to use the authentication tester against the compromised user to trigger the XSS.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects OPNSense versions 19.7 and 21.7.
- A patch was released in version 21.7.4 to address the issue.
- The provided content includes a Proof of Concept (POC) that demonstrates the exploitation of the XSS vulnerability to create a new administrator user.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Orange CERT-CC.
- The vulnerability is classified as moderate severity.
- Workarounds are suggested such as input/output filtering, and Content-Security-Policy updates.
