Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42077:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is improper validation of user input in the PHP Event Calendar Lite edition. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or properly handle SQL statements provided by the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection (CWE-89):** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection attacks. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code into the application's database queries.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability can be exploited to bypass the login mechanism, allowing an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application with admin privileges.
*   **Database Compromise:** The SQL injection vulnerability can be leveraged to execute arbitrary SQL statements on the database. This can lead to complete compromise of the database system. This may include the ability to read, modify, or delete data, or even execute system commands on the database server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/server/ajax/user_manager.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Username:** The vulnerable parameter is the `username` field, where a malicious SQL statement can be injected.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
*   The attacker does not need prior authentication. The SQL injection vulnerability can be exploited directly to bypass the login.

**Technical Details:**

*   The provided Proof of Concept (PoC) demonstrates that the SQL payload `' OR '1' = '1' #` when used as a username allows login bypass. The response from the server includes `success#Welcome ' OR '1' = '1' #`, indicating that the application processed the injected SQL statement and authenticated the user based on the truth of '1'='1'.
*   The vulnerable application is PHP Event Calendar Lite edition.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on July 29, 2021 and publicly disclosed on November 4, 2021. A patch was released by the manufacturer on September 3, 2021.

**Additional Details:**
* The advisory provides a clear timeline of discovery, vendor notification, patching and disclosure of the vulnerability.
* It also provides contact information for the researchers that discovered the vulnerability.
