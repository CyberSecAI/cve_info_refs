Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-42663:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in the `msg` parameter of the `index.php` page of the Online Event Booking and Reservation System. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code into the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **HTML Injection:** The system does not sanitize or encode user-supplied input before displaying it in the application's web page.
- The vulnerable parameter is located in the URL, making it easily manipulable.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary HTML Execution:** An attacker can inject any HTML code into the vulnerable page.
- **Website Defacement:** An attacker can alter the visual appearance and content of the vulnerable page, causing it to display attacker-controlled content, potentially misleading or malicious.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **URL Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a URL that includes a malicious HTML payload within the `msg` parameter.
- **Social Engineering:** The attacker must persuade the victim to click the malicious link.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Basic HTTP knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to manipulate URL parameters.
- **Ability to craft HTML payload:** The attacker must be able to write the desired HTML code.
- **Social engineering skills:** The attacker must trick a user into visiting the malicious link.

**Technical Details (from provided content):**

- **Vulnerable Page:** `index.php`
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** `msg`
- **Example Payload:** `<h1>This is an HTML injection</h1>`
- The exploit relies on the lack of sanitization of the 'msg' parameter when rendering the page, and an attacker can control what is displayed on the page by injecting arbitrary HTML code into this parameter via URL.
