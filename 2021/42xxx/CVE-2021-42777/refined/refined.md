Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42777:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject and execute arbitrary C# code within a reporting library, specifically Stimulsoft Reports 2013.1.1600.0, through a templating system. The application compiles user-provided input, intended for report generation, as C# code. This allows for the injection of malicious code. The vulnerability relies on the ability to chain C# commands that ultimately return an Object.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The application directly compiles user-provided input as C# code.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize or validate user input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary code.
- **Object Chaining:** The attacker can chain together C# commands that return objects to achieve code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the local machine where the application is installed, as well as potentially on the server the application is connected to.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can read files on the system by using `System.IO.File.ReadAllText`.
- **External Server Interaction:** The attacker can make the application interact with an external server via `System.Net.WebRequest`.
- **Process Execution:** The attacker can start arbitrary processes on the machine using `System.Diagnostics.Process.Start`.
- **Complete System Compromise:**  The RCE vulnerability can lead to a complete compromise of the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- User input in the Report Editor is compiled as C# code.
- The attacker can inject malicious C# code within the templating system of the reporting functionality.
- The attacker crafts malicious code chains that return an object and execute arbitrary commands

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs access to the application's report editor or any component that processes user-provided input as C# code.
- The attacker must be able to craft valid C# code chains.
- No specific authentication requirements are mentioned, indicating a possible pre-auth vulnerability.
