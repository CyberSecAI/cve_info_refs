- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is present in the `GetDumpFile` command of the Broadcom Emulex HBA Manager/One Command Manager application. It is triggered due to insufficient access control on remote management functionality.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The application has an arbitrary file retrieval vulnerability. This vulnerability can be exploited via the remote `GetDumpFile` command. This is due to the lack of proper authentication and access control when not in "Strictly Local Management mode."
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker can retrieve any file from the host system where the Emulex HBA Manager is installed, provided that the application is not in Strictly Local Management mode.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited through the remote management interface of the Emulex HBA Manager using the `GetDumpFile` command.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have network access to the host running the vulnerable Emulex HBA Manager application. They do not need to be authenticated if the application is not configured in "Strictly Local Management mode".
