### CVE-2021-42103 Analysis:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the insecure loading of an OpenSSL configuration file. The process loads this file from a location that lacks proper security measures.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Uncontrolled search path element: The software loads a configuration file from an unsecured location allowing an attacker to manipulate the file
- Privilege Escalation: The vulnerability allows an attacker to gain elevated privileges on the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to SYSTEM level, enabling them to execute arbitrary code with the highest level of permissions on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
Local attackers can exploit this vulnerability. The attack vector requires the attacker to have the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be able to execute code on the target machine
- The attacker requires low-privilege access to the system to be able to leverage this vulnerability.
