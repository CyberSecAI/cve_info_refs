{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Heap out-of-bounds read vulnerability in ClickHouse's LZ4 compression codec.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The LZ4 decompression implementation reads a 16-bit unsigned user-supplied value ('offset') from the compressed data.",
      "This offset is used to calculate a source address for a copy operation, without checking if the address is within the bounds of the allocated memory buffer.",
      "Specifically, there's no lower bounds check to ensure that the source address is not before the beginning of the allocated buffer."
    ],
    "impact": "Denial of Service or Information Leakage.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By crafting a malicious query with a specific offset value in the compressed data, an attacker can cause the server to read from memory outside the allocated buffer."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs valid credentials to connect to the ClickHouse server. Any user with read permissions can trigger the vulnerability."
  }
