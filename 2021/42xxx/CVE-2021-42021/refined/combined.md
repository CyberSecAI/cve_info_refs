GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to affected
products with appropriate mechanisms. It is advised to follow recommended security practices in order to
run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Siveillance Video (formerly called Siveillance VMS) is a powerful IP video management software designed
for deployments ranging from small and simple to large-scale and high-security. The Siveillance Video
portfolio consists of four versions, Siveillance Video Core, Core Plus, Advanced, and Pro, addressing the
speciﬁc needs of small and medium size solutions up to large complex deployments.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.
