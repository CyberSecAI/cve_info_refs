### **Summary:**

* On Friday, January 21, 2022, PrinterLogic published a [security notification](https://www.printerlogic.com/security-bulletin/) with links to software updates that resolve several vulnerabilities the Paranoids’ Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) found in their product.
* In order to exploit the vulnerabilities in the unpatched version, attackers would need a privileged network position — such as access through a VPN or another (SSRF, perhaps) vulnerability in an appliance on the edge.
* If you haven't already, please update to the latest version of PrinterLogic, 19.1.1.13-SP10.

In Summer 2021, the Paranoids’ Vulnerability Research Team (VRT) discovered a series of weaknesses in a popular software suite that centralizes the management of printer assignment.

Soon after, the team reached out to start working with the vendor, PrinterLogic, to issue CVEs and fixes for those vulnerabilities.

It’s a reminder that as your company grows in size, it’s only natural to reach for enterprise products that simplify management of key functionality that many of your employees use (in this case, printers). A byproduct of centralized management, however, is centralized risk.

To be clear, a majority of installations of PrinterLogic are not internet-facing.

That means attackers would first need a privileged network position — such as access through a VPN or another (SSRF, perhaps) vulnerability in an appliance on the edge — to exploit the PrinterLogic Web Stack server.

Regardless, it’s important to patch because of the severity of the vulnerabilities the Paranoids VRT disclosed to the vendor last year.

Patches were issued on Friday, January 21. And all versions previous to 19.1.1.13-SP10 are vulnerable.

Additional information about these security advisories, from PrinterLogic, can be found at their security bulletins page at <https://www.printerlogic.com/security-bulletin/>.

### Introduction

Now to the nitty-gritty. Last Friday, January 21, 2022, an update was released for PrinterLogic Web Stack that fixed a collection of vulnerabilities identified by our Vulnerability Research Team, some of which allowed for remote code execution on that Web Stack server:

* CVE-2021-42631: Object Injection leading to RCE
* CVE-2021-42635: Hardcoded APP\_KEY leading to RCE
* CVE-2021-42638: Misc command injections leading to RCE
* CVE-2021-42633: SQLi may disclose audit logs
* CVE-2021-42637: Blind SSRF
* CVE-2021-42639: Misc reflected XSS
* CVE-2021-42640: Driver assignment IDOR
* CVE-2021-42641: Username/email info disclosure
* CVE-2021-42642: Printer console username/password info disclosure

If you haven’t already, please update to the latest version, 19.1.1.13-SP10***.*** These vulnerabilities were identified through a combination of reverse engineering and manual code review (aided by Semgrep).

In this post, we’ll briefly break down one of the vulnerabilities, showcase what initial exploitation looks like, and finally, show how an attacker going the extra mile can significantly increase the impact to an enterprise target. Additionally, we’ll take a look at why PrinterLogic, and other products like it, may serve as a strategic target for attackers.

### PrinterLogic Primed

[PrinterLogic](https://printerlogic.com/) is an enterprise software product that enables simplified, centralized management of a fleet of printers. Using the self-service portal, end users who have the PrinterInstallerClient application installed can quickly find and install their own printers with a single click. Companies typically run a PrinterLogic Web Stack server internally, and get the PrinterInstallerClient application installed on their endpoints.

There are a few qualities that make products like PrinterLogic stand out as valuable footholds for an attacker:

* It has an agent that is designed to run on many or all endpoints
* That agent can install components or configure the endpoint in some way with administrative level permissions
* Finally, the vendor publishes a [customer list](https://printerlogic.com/customers/), which shows exactly what the return on investment is for attackers. If an attacker finds one vulnerability, extensively compromise over 140 high-profile organizations.

For these reasons, we decided to audit the PrinterLogic Web Stack for vulnerabilities.

### Time to 0day

As part of the vulnerability research setup, we installed PrinterLogic Web Stack in a virtual machine. A client VM running macOS was also created, which ran the PrinterInstallerClient endpoint software.

Our timeline was as follows:

* April 19th - Set up a testing environment
* May 4th - Decrypted the Web Stack server code, which allowed us to begin performing source auditing
* May 6th - Identified initial pre-auth object injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-42631)
* May 19th - Began Work on developing a full exploitation toolkit around the vulnerability
* June 4th - Full exploit was completed and ready for operational use

We continued auditing code and identified additional vulnerabilities of varying types and severity. These vulnerabilities were shared with PrinterLogic as part of a coordinated disclosure process.

### Vulnerability Analysis

While we won’t disclose the exact location of the vulnerability in order to give customers some time to patch, we can still take a look at a snippet that is close to the real code:

This is a pretty classic example of PHP Object Injection. Attacker controlled input is taken from a GET parameter (param) and base64 decoded, then that input is used as the input to [unserialize](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.unserialize.php).The particular endpoint this code is based on is accessible without requiring authentication.

PrinterLogic is not alone, object injection has historically been a problem bug class in PHP applications, including even big names like [ConcreteCMS](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36766), [Magento](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2020-9664), and [Moodle.](https://haxolot.com/posts/2021/moodle_pre_auth_shibboleth_rce_part1/)

Object injection vulnerabilities allow an attacker to instantiate an object of an arbitrary class in the target, with the values of the object’s properties being attacker controlled. Some classes may implement what are called [*magic methods*](https://www.php.net/manual/en/language.oop5.magic.php), which can be triggered in specific ways during the lifecycle of that object. Some of the often abused magic methods include (but are not limited to):

* \_\_wakeup - Triggered just after instantiation
* \_\_destruct - Triggered when the object is cleaned up
* \_\_call - Triggered a method is called that is not implemented in the class
* \_\_toString - Triggered when the object is converted to a string

If a class implements a magic method such as \_\_wakeup, leveraging properties from the class (which in this case are attacker controlled), and calls into or instantiates objects from other libraries that perform unsafe operations with the input, or directly uses the input in an unsafe way (e.g. as part of a command string passed to exec), dangerous exploitation primitives can arise. These call chains that are useful for exploitation, where the attacker controls the properties, are called POP (property oriented programming) chains.  A few examples of useful primitives that can result include command execution, arbitrary file write, and arbitrary file read.

An important caveat is that the definition for the class being instantiated must be loaded by the time unserialize is called. In the case of our target, things are a little easier. Laravel supports autoloading of classes in dependencies, significantly increasing the number of classes available for object instantiation.

### Initial Compromise

In the case of this particular vulnerability, we can use off the shelf tooling to get initial code execution. [phpggc](https://github.com/ambionics/phpggc) implements gadget chains for a variety of frameworks including Laravel, CakePHP, WordPress, and others. We can use the Laravel/RCE2 chain, which is triggered through \_\_destruct:

By supplying the payload as input to the API endpoint which exposes the vulnerable unserialize call, we achieve code execution as the IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool user.

*Code execution as the IIS APPPOOL\DefaultAppPool user.*

### Taking Code Execution to the Next Level

We’ll assume that by leveraging the aforementioned vulnerability, we’ve managed to drop a webshell or other implant that grants persistent access to the Web Stack server. Now we’ll discuss how an attacker can ratchet up the impact to move laterally into arbitrary workstations by leveraging PrinterLogic’s own features.

One of PrinterLogic’s core features is single-click printer installation. Installing a printer for an endpoint properly sometimes requires supplemental software or configurations being deployed to their system for proper setup. This is solved for with driver packages, which can be associated with a printer in the inventory. When a user clicks to install a printer from the self-service portal, the PrinterLogic workstation client (PrinterInstallerClient) will pull down the associated driver package and install it. But what actually happens behind the curtain to install the driver, and how can it be abused for exploitation?

### Driver Package Installation

For MacOS and Linux, the driver package format is fairly simple. All of the contained resources are wrapped as a bzip2 compressed tarball. At the heart of the driver package is the path\_map file, which specifies the list of resources to install, and where they’ll be installed to:

In the above example, the driver package contains only one resource to install, which is the printer’s PPD (PostScript Printer Description). A more complicated driver package may contain supplementary applications or libraries that must be installed on the target. PrinterInstallerClient will decompress and unpack the tarball to a working directory, then inspect the contents of path\_map. It will copy the file or folder named by the json key(s) from the working directory to the path specified in the map. In the above example, the file named 0 from the archive will be placed at /etc/cups/ppd/Xerod.ppd). You can include any number of resources to place at arbitrary locations, so long as each has a unique number and is stored alongside the path\_map file.

On Windows, a different driver packaging format is used. Targeting Windows hosts also requires the attacker to code-sign their payload for it to be unpacked successfully on the target.

The bytes for these driver packages are stored in the MySQL database attached to the PrinterLogic Web Stack server, in the table ppp\_driver\_package\_fragments as a base64 encoded blob. Each driver will have a corresponding metadata entry in ppp\_driver\_packages, specifying all the relevant properties of the driver such as the name, version, release date, and size. To associate a driver package with the appropriate printer, an entry is set in the ppp\_printer\_os\_settings table which ties a printer ID, an OS ID, and a driver ID together.

If we can control the contents of a driver package that is delivered to an endpoint by manipulating the database, we effectively have an arbitrary filesystem write on connected endpoints. The added bonus is that PrinterInstallerClient runs as root.

### Achieving Code Execution

With an arbitrary write in hand, now we need to make the jump to executing code on the endpoint that receives the driver package. Luckily, we have a few options across each platform that aren’t particularly difficult. Let’s take a look at one.

On macOS, the [periodic service](http://www.thexlab.com/faqs/maintscripts.html) runs scheduled maintenance scripts. The /etc/periodic/ directory holds daily,  monthly, and weekly directories, under which a collection of scripts sit. If you place a script under any of these directories, the periodic service will execute it (roughly) once per respective period (daily, monthly, or weekly).

![Terminal window showing the cron job installed.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6721939c8726e5c8dc6b9f9f/6721939c8726e5c8dc6ba3f6_61e8a47833c8d8856adf1dbc_bash.png)

The periodic service can sometimes miss its execution window, at which point it reschedules to run at another time. By writing a shell script marked executable to /etc/periodic/daily/hax.sh, we could run arbitrary commands (roughly) once per day. As part of our exploit we’ll craft a driver package that, when installed, writes a shell script or other implant to the periodic service’s daily directory. When the service fires, we’ll achieve code execution on the endpoint.

### Door is Push, Not Pull

With our knowledge thus far,  we can backdoor existing driver packages in the PrinterLogic Web Stack server. When a user visits the self service portal to install a printer, the backdoored driver would be installed and grant the attacker code execution. But this has the downside of requiring the user to be enticed to install the malicious printer. This makes it difficult to perform targeted exploitation of individual users, since we can’t guarantee that they’ll download our driver.  Is it possible to switch the model around, so that we can push drivers to arbitrary endpoints, rather than waiting for users to choose to install them? It turns out there’s a feature for just that.

Printers can be deployed to endpoints running PrinterInstallerClient according to a set of scoping criteria. Some of the scoping criteria you can use to specify the installation group include:

* Active Directory User, Computer, Group, or OU
* IP address range
* Hostname
* MAC Address

![PrinterLogic targeting via the web ui.](https://cdn.prod.website-files.com/6721939c8726e5c8dc6b9f9f/6721939c8726e5c8dc6ba3f7_61e8a590e3cf2dd2de16d857_printerlogic.png)

A hostname can even be specified as a wildcard (\*), which would scope the printer to **all** endpoints that are clients of the Web Stack server. These deployment settings are stored in the ppp\_tree\_associations table, which matches up an association between a printer node (specified in the ppp\_tree table) and an endpoint (specified in the ppp\_hostnames table).

By default, PrinterInstallerClient will check in with the Web Stack server every 4 hours to request the latest printer configuration for that endpoint. If there is an updated configuration or new printers have been assigned, it will download the relevant driver packages and install them as appropriate.

With all pieces in place, we now understand that an attacker who compromises the Web Stack server itself can get remote code execution on all connected endpoints that are clients of the Web Stack server, or compromise select endpoints as they see fit, without requiring further user interaction.

### Place in the Oven, Bake at 350º

All the required capabilities for our exploit are now identified, and just need to be wrapped up nicely and baked into a clean exploit:

1. Directly compromise the PrinterLogic Web Stack server by leveraging the pre-authentication object injection vulnerability
2. Manipulate the database to insert a new driver package in the ppp\_driver\_package and ppp\_driver\_package\_fragments tables
3. Create a new printer within the ppp\_printers and ppp\_tree tables, and associate it with our malicious driver package via the ppp\_printer\_os\_settings table
4. Assign the malicious printer to arbitrary (or all) workstations in the enterprise that are running PrinterInstallerClient by creating association entries in ppp\_tree\_associations.
5. Wait patiently for shells to rain across the enterprise

In order to make some of the database operations easier to handle, we ended up reusing some of the existing PrinterLogic PHP code in our full exploit to manipulate these tables using DAO objects. Check out the video shown below to see the full exploit working. In order to keep the video length short (less than 24 hours), we manually triggered the periodic service. But, this service typically runs on its own as appropriate.

## PrinterLogic 🖨 Fixes Critical Vulnerabilities in its suite

![](https://thecyberthrone.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/images281629-1.png)
BY [PravinKarthik](https://thecyberthrone.in/author/pravinkarthik/)
January 26, 2022![](https://i0.wp.com/thecyberthrone.in/wp-content/uploads/2022/01/images281629.png?resize=200%2C200&ssl=1)

PrinterLogic has patched nine vulnerabilities in Web Stack and Virtual Appliance, the most severe ones, tracked as CVE-2021-42631, CVE-2021-42635, and CVE-2021-42638, are rated as high severity flaws (CVSS base score of 8.1).

Below is the list of vulnerabilities fixed by Paranoids:

* CVE-2021-42631: Object Injection leading to RCE
* CVE-2021-42635: Hardcoded APP\_KEY leading to RCE
* CVE-2021-42638: Misc command injections leading to RCE
* CVE-2021-42633: SQLi may disclose audit logs
* CVE-2021-42637: Blind SSRF
* CVE-2021-42639: Misc reflected XSS
* CVE-2021-42640: Driver assignment IDOR
* CVE-2021-42641: Username/email info disclosure
* CVE-2021-42642: Printer console username/password info disclosure

Advertisements

An attacker can trigger these three vulnerabilities to remotely execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.

CVE-2021-42631 is an object injection flaw, CVE-2021-42635 is a hardcoded APP\_KEY issue, while CVE-2021-42638 is miscellaneous command injections. PrinterLogic pointed out that most of the installs are not internet-facing.

To exploit the PrinterLogic Web Stack server, attackers would need a privileged network position, such as access through a VPN or another vulnerability in an appliance on the edge.

Researchers didn’t disclosed the component affected by the vulnerability in order to give customers some time to address the flaws. All are not directly accessible from open web

Advertisements

The flaws impact all PrinterLogic Web Stack version 19.1.1.13 SP9 and earlier, and Virtual Appliance version 20.0.1304 and earlier, when used with macOS or Linux endpoint client software.

PrinterLogic addressed the issue with the release of **Web Stack version 19.1.1.13-SP10**, no client software updates are required for Virtual Appliance.

## PrinterLogic has addressed nine vulnerabilities in Web Stack and Virtual Appliance, including three high severity flaws.

PrinterLogic has released security updates to address [nine vulnerabilities](https://www.printerlogic.com/security-bulletin/) in Web Stack and Virtual Appliance, the most severe ones, tracked as CVE-2021-42631, CVE-2021-42635, and CVE-2021-42638, are rated as high severity flaws (CVSS base score of 8.1).

Below is the list of vulnerabilities fixed by Paranoids:

* CVE-2021-42631: Object Injection leading to RCE
* CVE-2021-42635: Hardcoded APP\_KEY leading to RCE
* CVE-2021-42638: Misc command injections leading to RCE
* CVE-2021-42633: SQLi may disclose audit logs
* CVE-2021-42637: Blind SSRF
* CVE-2021-42639: Misc reflected XSS
* CVE-2021-42640: Driver assignment IDOR
* CVE-2021-42641: Username/email info disclosure
* CVE-2021-42642: Printer console username/password info disclosure

An attacker can trigger these three vulnerabilities to remotely execute arbitrary code on vulnerable systems.

CVE-2021-42631 is an object injection flaw, CVE-2021-42635 is a hardcoded APP\_KEY issue, while CVE-2021-42638 is miscellaneous command injections. PrinterLogic pointed out that most of the installs are not internet-facing.

In order to exploit the PrinterLogic Web Stack server, attackers would need a privileged network position, such as access through a VPN or another vulnerability (i.e. SSRF) in an appliance on the edge.

Experts did not disclose the component affected by the vulnerability in order to give customers some time to address the flaws.

The timeline for the flaws is:

* April 19th – Set up a testing environment
* May 4th – Decrypted the Web Stack server code, which allowed us to begin performing source auditing
* May 6th – Identified initial pre-auth object injection vulnerability (CVE-2021-42631)
* May 19th – Began Work on developing a full exploitation toolkit around the vulnerability
* June 4th – Full exploit was completed and ready for operational use

The Paranoids researchers noted that the majority of PrinterLogic installations are not directly accessible from the Internet.

The flaws impact all PrinterLogic Web Stack version 19.1.1.13 SP9 and earlier, and Virtual Appliance version 20.0.1304 and earlier, when used with macOS or Linux endpoint client software.

PrinterLogic addressed the issue with the release of Web Stack version 19.1.1.13-SP10, no client software updates are required for Virtual Appliance. .

High severity flaws show centralized management means centralized risk, say researchers

![PrinterLogic vendor addresses triple RCE threat against all connected endpoints](/cms/images/3b/1b/fdda-article-220125-printer-body-text.png "Image: 32 Pixels / Shutterstock / PortSwigger Ltd")

UPDATED A trio of [vulnerabilities](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/vulnerabilities) in enterprise print management software PrinterLogic offer attackers a route to remote code execution (RCE) on all connected endpoints, security researchers have revealed.

All assigned a CVSS rating of 8.1, the high severity flaws include object injection (CVE-2021-42631), hardcoded APP\_KEY (CVE-2021-42635), and [command injection](/web-security/os-command-injection) (CVE-2021-42638) issues.

Researchers from The Paranoids, Yahoo’s vulnerability research team, achieved [RCE](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/rce) on the web stack server via abuse of PrinterLogic’s single-click printer installation feature.

[Read more of the latest security research news](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/chain-of-vulnerabilities-led-to-rce-on-cisco-prime-servers)

The bugs, discovered during research conducted between April and June 2021, were addressed by PrinterLogic vendor Vasion in security update 19.1.1.13-SP10, [issued on January 21](https://www.printerlogic.com/security-bulletin). All prior versions are vulnerable.

The update also addresses a raft of medium and low severity bugs uncovered by Yahoo’s security research arm.

### Return on investment

Blaine Herro, a security researcher at Yahoo, says PrinterLogic makes for an appealing attack target, in part because it has an agent that can run on many or all endpoints, and install components on or configure endpoints with administrator-level permissions.

Moreover, “the vendor publishes a customer list, which shows exactly what the return on investment is for attackers,” continues Herro in a [technical write-up](https://www.yahooinc.com/paranoids/paranoids-vulnerability-research-printerlogic-issues-security-alert/). “If an attacker finds one vulnerability, [they can] extensively compromise over 140 high-profile organizations.”

However, the severity of the vulnerabilities at hand is lessened by attackers requiring a privileged network position via a VPN or applicable vulnerability in an appliance on the edge, except for internet-facing installations (which applies to few environments, says Herro).

### PHP object injection

Herro detailed an exploit that begins with “a pretty classic example” of unauthenticated PHP object injection – a “historically” problematic bug class in PHP applications including ConcreteCMS, [Magento](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/web-admins-urged-to-update-magento-stores-as-first-release-line-reaches-end-of-life), and [Moodle](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/finders-cheaters-rce-bug-in-moodle-e-learning-platform-could-be-abused-to-steal-data-manipulate-results).

RELATED [RCE bug in Moodle e-learning platform could be abused to steal data, manipulate results](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/finders-cheaters-rce-bug-in-moodle-e-learning-platform-could-be-abused-to-steal-data-manipulate-results)

Once the server is compromised and persistent access secured, attackers could move laterally into arbitrary workstations when users perform single-click installation, which prompts the PrinterLogic workstation client (PrinterInstallerClient) to pull down and install the relevant driver package.

Herro sets out how to control the contents of a driver package sent to an endpoint on macOS and Linux or [Windows](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/windows) by manipulating the database, thereby gaining an arbitrary filesystem write on connected endpoints.

“The added bonus is that PrinterInstallerClient runs as root,” he adds.

There are “a few options across each platform that aren’t particularly difficult” for executing code on endpoints that receive driver packages, says the researcher. He explains how to do so on macOS by injecting a script among scheduled maintenance scripts run by the periodic service.

### Abusing scoping criteria

Unsatisfied with [duping](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/social-engineering) potential marks into downloading a specific backdoored printer driver, the researchers unearthed a feature that enabled them to push drivers to arbitrary endpoints.

Specifically, printers can be deployed to endpoints running PrinterInstallerClient according to scoping criteria. This criteria includes hostnames, which can be specified as a wildcard, thereby scoping the printer to all endpoints that are clients of the web stack server.

This means attackers can achieve RCE “on all connected endpoints that are clients of the Web Stack server, or compromise select endpoints as they see fit, without requiring further user interaction,” says Herro.

He adds: “As your company grows in size, it’s only natural to reach for [enterprise](https://portswigger.net/daily-swig/enterprise) products that simplify management of key functionality that many of your employees use (in this case, printers). A byproduct of centralized management, however, is centralized risk.”

### Vasion comment

A spokesperson for Vasion said: “Vasion Security worked side by side with The Paranoids, a Verizon Media security team, to release the CVE’s mentioned in January after all vulnerabilities were resolved.

“While the initial discovery of vulnerabilities was tied to our Web Stack platform, our [remediation efforts](https://printerlogic.com/security-bulletin/) went beyond that to also include the PrinterLogic Virtual Appliance and PrinterLogic SaaS. Corrective measures have already been applied to SaaS and are now live.

“Vasion wants to thank the Paranoids Research team at Verizon Media. We appreciate customers with a strong sense of security, who are willing to help harden our product offerings.”
