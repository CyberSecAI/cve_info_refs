Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the use of hard-coded credentials within the Xylem AquaView SCADA system.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Hard-coded credentials (CWE-798) are present in the software. This allows attackers to potentially bypass authentication mechanisms.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful exploit could allow an authenticated *local* attacker to:
    - Create users.
    - Delete users.
    - Disable user groups.
    - Update the system and its security levels.
    - Reuse the credentials to further penetrate the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access is required. This means the attacker must have some level of access to the system itself (not remotely exploitable).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have authenticated local access to the affected system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.3.
- The vulnerability affects AquaView versions 1.60, 7.x, and 8.x.
- There is no evidence that the vulnerability has been exploited in the wild.
- The vendor, Xylem, has released a security advisory (XSA-2021-006) and recommends that users apply the security update.
- The CISA advisory also links to recommended practices for control system security and provides guidance on incident reporting.
