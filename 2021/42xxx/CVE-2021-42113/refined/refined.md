Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details for CVE-2021-42113:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists in the `StorageSecurityCommandDxe` driver within InsydeH2O firmware. Specifically, it's an SMM (System Management Mode) callout vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability allows a potential attacker to hijack the execution flow of code running in SMM.
- The core issue is related to improper input validation which could lead to arbitrary code execution in SMM.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to escalating privileges to SMM.
- This could result in disclosure of sensitive information, addition or modification of data, or Denial of Service (DoS).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L), meaning the attacker needs to have local access to the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs high privileges (PR:H) on the local system, and no user interaction (UI:N) is required.
- The attacker needs to be able to execute code that can trigger the vulnerable SMM callout.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is present in InsydeH2O Kernel 5.1 before 05.14.28, Kernel 5.2 before 05.24.28, and Kernel 5.3 before 05.32.25.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Binarly efiXplorer team.
- NetApp states that none of their products are affected by this vulnerability.
- Siemens indicates that multiple of their products are affected, including RUGGEDCOM APE1808 and SIMATIC IPC.
