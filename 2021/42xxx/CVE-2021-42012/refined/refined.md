Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42012:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a lack of proper validation of the length of user-supplied data before copying it to a stack-based buffer within the Trend Micro Security Server Database Service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stack-based buffer overflow: The vulnerability arises from writing data beyond the allocated buffer on the stack.
- Insufficient input validation: The software fails to validate the length of user-provided data before using it, allowing the buffer overflow to occur.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privilege escalation: Successful exploitation allows a local attacker to escalate privileges to SYSTEM level.
- Arbitrary code execution: The attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of the SYSTEM user, granting them complete control over the compromised system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker must have the ability to execute code on the target system.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Local, low-privileged code execution capability: The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the targeted system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory confirms that Trend Micro has released an update to address this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability exists within the Trend Micro Security Server Database Service.
- The CVSS score is 7.8, indicating a high severity.
