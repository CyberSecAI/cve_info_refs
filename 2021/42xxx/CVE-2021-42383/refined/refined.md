{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "A use-after-free vulnerability exists in the `awk` applet of BusyBox due to improper handling of memory during the evaluation of crafted patterns.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Use-after-free",
      "Improper memory management"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation can lead to denial of service (DoS) and potentially arbitrary code execution.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can exploit this vulnerability by supplying a specially crafted pattern to the `awk` applet.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to control the input to the `awk` applet, specifically the pattern argument."
  },
  "affected_applet": "awk",
  "affected_versions": "1.33.1",
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability occurs in the `evaluate` function, one of several use-after-free vulnerabilities found in `awk`. Exploitation may lead to remote code execution under rare conditions. The vulnerability can be triggered if the attacker can supply an arbitrary pattern to the `awk` command."
