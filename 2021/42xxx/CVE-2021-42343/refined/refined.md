  "CVE-2021-42343": {
    "Description": "An issue was discovered in Dask (aka python-dask) through 2021.09.1. Single machine Dask clusters started with dask.distributed.LocalCluster or dask.distributed.Client (which defaults to using LocalCluster) would mistakenly configure their respective Dask workers to listen on external interfaces (typically with a randomly selected high port) rather than only on localhost. A Dask cluster created using this method (when running on a machine that has an applicable port exposed) could be used by a sophisticated attacker to achieve remote code execution.",
    "Root cause": "The `host` parameter to `LocalCluster` was only forwarded to `Scheduler` instances and not `Worker`/`Nanny` instances. This resulted in workers listening on non-localhost interfaces.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect configuration of network interfaces"
    ],
    "Impact": "Remote code execution",
    "Attack vector": "Network",
    "Attacker capabilities": "A sophisticated attacker with network access to a machine running a vulnerable Dask cluster with exposed ports.",
    "Additional Information": {
      "Affected Components": "dask.distributed.LocalCluster, dask.distributed.Client",
      "Affected Versions": "All versions of `dask` up to 2021.10.0",
      "Fix": "The vulnerability was patched by ensuring that the `host` parameter is correctly forwarded to all created objects including `Worker`/`Nanny` instances.",
       "CVSS Score": "9.3"
    }
