Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-42363:

**1. Verification:**

*   The content directly mentions `CVE-2021-42363` and its association with the `Preview E-mails for WooCommerce` plugin.

**2. Root Cause of the Vulnerability:**
*   The root cause is a lack of input sanitization and output escaping for the `search_order` parameter within the `~/views/form.php` file of the `Preview E-mails for WooCommerce` plugin.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   The primary weakness is a **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerability.
*   The plugin echoes user-supplied input (the `search_order` parameter) directly into the HTML output of a page without proper sanitization or escaping.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into a page. This code could perform various malicious actions, including:
    *   Session hijacking of logged-in administrators.
    *   Injecting malicious code to gain control over the website.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Modifying plugin or theme files to add backdoors.
    *   Creating new administrative users.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector is a crafted URL containing malicious JavaScript within the `search_order` parameter.
*   An attacker would need to convince a site administrator to click on this malicious link.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs no prior access to the website to craft the URL. 
*   The attacker needs the ability to trick a site administrator into clicking on a malicious URL.

**Technical Details:**
*   The vulnerability is located in the `~/views/form.php` file.
*   The plugin uses a `<select>` element for searching orders with no input escaping:
   ```php
   <select name="search_order" id="woo_preview_search_orders" class="woo_preview_search_orders" class="regular-text" style="width: 35%;">
   <?php
     if ( ! empty( $_POST['search_order'] ) ) {
      ?>
          <option value="<?php echo $_POST['search_order']; ?>" selected="selected">#order : <?php echo $_POST['search_order']; ?></option>
        <?php
    }
  ?>
  </select>
   ```
* The fix implemented, added proper escaping to the `$_POST['search_order']` parameters:
  ```php
    <option value="<?php echo esc_attr( $_POST['search_order'] ); ?>" selected="selected">#order : <?php echo esc_attr( $_POST['search_order'] ); ?></option>
  ```

**Additional Notes:**
*   The Wordfence firewall provides protection against this vulnerability, even in the free version.
*   The plugin developer patched the vulnerability in version 2.0.0, released on November 8, 2021.
*   The vulnerability is rated as "Medium" severity, however, it can lead to a complete takeover of a site.

In summary, CVE-2021-42363 describes a Reflected XSS vulnerability in the `Preview E-mails for WooCommerce` plugin, stemming from a lack of input sanitization, that could be used to compromise a website via a crafted URL. The vulnerability has been patched, and users are urged to update to the latest version, 2.0.0 or newer.
