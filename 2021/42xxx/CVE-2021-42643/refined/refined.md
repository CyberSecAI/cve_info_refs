Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Arbitrary File Write:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `template_admin.php` file in CmsEasy 7.7.5 allows an attacker to write arbitrary content to a file on the server due to insufficient input validation and path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **Path Traversal:** The application uses regular expressions to transform user-supplied input in the 'sid' parameter but fails to adequately sanitize the input. The `.._d_` string is converted to `../`, enabling path traversal.
        *   **Insecure File Handling:** The application directly uses `file_put_contents` to write content to a file based on the manipulated path.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can write malicious PHP code to the server, which can lead to remote code execution (RCE) and complete system compromise.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   HTTP POST request to `/index.php?case=template&act=save&admin_dir=admin&site=default`
        *   `sid` parameter containing path traversal sequences such as `#data_d_.._d_.._d_.._d_1.php`.
        *   `scontent` parameter containing the content to be written.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *   The attacker must be logged in to the admin panel to exploit this vulnerability.
        *   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.

2.  **Arbitrary File Read:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `template_admin.php` file in CmsEasy 7.7.5 allows an attacker to read arbitrary files from the server due to insufficient input validation and path traversal vulnerabilities.
    *   **Weaknesses:**
        *   **Path Traversal:** Similar to the file write vulnerability, the application uses inadequate regular expressions to sanitize the `id` parameter, allowing path traversal with the `.._d_` sequence.
        *   **Insecure File Handling:** The application directly uses `file_get_contents` to read a file based on the manipulated path.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can read sensitive files on the server, such as configuration files containing database credentials, potentially leading to further compromise.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**
        *   HTTP POST request to `/index.php?case=template&act=fetch&admin_dir=admin&site=default`
        *   `id` parameter containing path traversal sequences such as `#data_d_.._d_.._d_.._d_config_d_config_database.php`.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
        *  The attacker must be logged in to the admin panel to exploit this vulnerability.
        * The attacker needs to know the vulnerable endpoint and parameters.

**Summary:**

This document describes two vulnerabilities in CmsEasy 7.7.5, both stemming from improper handling of user-supplied input and path traversal vulnerabilities within the `template_admin.php` file. One vulnerability allows for arbitrary file writing, leading to potential remote code execution, while the other allows for arbitrary file reading, which can expose sensitive information. Both vulnerabilities require the attacker to be logged into the admin panel.
