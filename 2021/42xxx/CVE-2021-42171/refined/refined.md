Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42171:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an insecure file upload functionality in Zenario CMS 9.0.54156. Specifically, the CMS allows an authenticated user with administrative privileges to:

1.  Upload a file with a non-executable extension (e.g., .docx).
2.  Modify the file extension to an executable one (e.g., .php) after uploading.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:** The CMS does not properly validate or restrict file extensions during the upload process.
*   **Lack of Extension Validation on Edit:** The CMS fails to validate or sanitize the file extension when editing document metadata, allowing modification to executable extensions.
*   **Insecure Storage:** Uploaded files are stored in a location accessible by the webserver without proper restrictions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a malicious file (e.g., a PHP web shell) and changing its extension to an executable one, an attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the web server.
*   **Server Compromise:** Successful exploitation allows the attacker to:
    *   Run system commands
    *   Browse server files
    *   Access local resources
    *   Potentially attack other servers
    *   Exploit other vulnerabilities
*   **Full System Access:**  The provided exploit can provide the attacker with shell access to the webserver under the `www-data` user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Web Interface:** The vulnerability is triggered via the web-based interface of Zenario CMS.
*   **Authenticated Users:** Attack requires a valid user account with admin rights on the Zenario CMS.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Admin Level Access:**  The attacker needs to be logged into the Zenario CMS as an administrator.
*   **Network Accessibility:** Access to the web interface of the vulnerable Zenario CMS instance.
*   **Knowledge of Zenario CMS:** Understanding the navigation and functionality of Zenario CMS's admin panel, particularly the document management and metadata editing sections.
*   **Ability to Manipulate HTTP Requests:** Using tools like Burp Suite to intercept, modify and forward requests when editing document metadata.

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability was found by Minh Quang Nguyen.
*   The vulnerability has been assigned CVE ID: CVE-2021-42171
*   The fix was released in version 9.0.55141, which now prevents uploading .html files and sanitizes uploaded SVG files. It also fixes the bug where admin users could change a file's extension.
*  The provided exploit code is available on GitHub: [https://github.com/minhnq22/CVE-2021-42171](https://github.com/minhnq22/CVE-2021-42171)
