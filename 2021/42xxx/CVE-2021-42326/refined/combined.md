Package        : redmine
Version        : 3.3.1-4+deb9u5
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-42326

of users on activity views due to an insufficient access filter.  An
attacker may infer information of users working on private projects.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
3.3.1-4+deb9u5.

We recommend that you upgrade your redmine packages.
