Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-42326:

**Summary:**

The vulnerability is an information leak in Redmine where usernames are exposed on activity index views due to insufficient access control, potentially revealing usernames associated with private projects.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

Insufficient permission checks in the display of activity data, specifically on the activities index view. This allowed the exposure of usernames in contexts where the user may not have been authorized to see them, such as when viewing activity logs related to private projects.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper permission checks on the activity index view, which resulted in exposing usernames that should have been restricted based on project access.
*   **Information Leakage:** The vulnerability resulted in sensitive information leakage (usernames).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could learn the usernames of individuals working on private projects, even if they are not members of those projects.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Information like usernames can be used in subsequent attacks such as social engineering or targeted phishing campaigns.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Browsing Activities Index View:** An attacker with access to the Redmine instance could potentially view activity feeds and identify users involved in projects they don't have access to.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to Redmine Instance:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Redmine instance, whether they are a legitimate user or an unauthorized party who has gained access.
*   **No Specific Privileges Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an attacker with relatively low privileges, as it's an issue with information display rather than privileged access.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is listed as "Moderate" severity by Redmine, as indicated in the security advisories document.
*   The fix for this vulnerability is included in Redmine versions 4.2.3 and 4.1.5, as well as a Debian security update (DLA 2787-1).
*   The vulnerability was reported as issue #35789
