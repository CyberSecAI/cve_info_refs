The provided content is related to CVE-2021-42391.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from a divide-by-zero error within the Gorilla compression codec of the ClickHouse database management system.

**Weaknesses:**
- The code attempts to perform a modulo operation where the divisor is read directly from the compressed input. This input is controlled by the user, allowing them to set the divisor to zero, leading to a divide-by-zero error.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Exploitation leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, causing the ClickHouse server to crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending a specially crafted compressed query to the ClickHouse server through its web interface or TCP server port.
- The attacker needs valid credentials to interact with the ClickHouse server. Even a low-privileged user with read-only access can trigger this vulnerability

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have access to the ClickHouse server's web interface or TCP server port.
- The attacker needs valid user credentials.
- The attacker needs the ability to construct a malicious compressed query containing a zero-value byte for the divisor.
