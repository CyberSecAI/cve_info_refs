- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "First name" field on the "/patient/insert" page of Chikitsa 2.0.2 does not properly sanitize user input, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript or HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript or HTML code that will be executed in the context of other users' browsers when they view pages where the injected data is displayed. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, defacement, or phishing attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves sending a crafted POST request to the "/patient/insert" page containing the malicious payload in the "First name" field.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be authenticated to the admin panel of Chikitsa to access the "/patient/insert" page and inject the malicious payload.
