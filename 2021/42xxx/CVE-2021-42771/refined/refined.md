{
  "cve": "CVE-2021-42771",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is due to a directory traversal flaw in Babel.Locale, which allows loading arbitrary locale .dat files from outside the intended locale-data directory.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Directory traversal",
      "Unsafe deserialization of data using pickle.load()"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary code execution. By crafting a malicious .dat file and causing Babel to load it, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the running process.",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker can specify a file path with directory traversal sequences (e.g., ../../) in the locale identifier to load a malicious .dat file from an arbitrary location on the file system.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to specify the locale identifier and have a malicious .dat file present on the file system where the vulnerable application is running."
