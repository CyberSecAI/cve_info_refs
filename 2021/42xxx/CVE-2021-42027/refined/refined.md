- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The affected software does not properly validate the server certificate when initiating a TLS connection.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper certificate validation (CWE-295).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could spoof a trusted entity by interfering in the communication path between the client and the intended server, potentially leading to unauthorized access or data manipulation. The vulnerability could lead to high confidentiality and integrity impact, while availability is not affected.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based. An attacker would need to be positioned to interfere with the network communication path between the client and the intended server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker does not need any privileges to exploit the vulnerability but needs to have a network position to conduct a man-in-the-middle attack. The attack complexity is high.
