Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-42224:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization and validation within the `IFSC Code Finder Project 1.0`. Specifically, the `searchifsccode` POST parameter in the `/search.php` script is directly incorporated into SQL queries without adequate filtering or sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The application is vulnerable to both time-based blind SQL injection and UNION query injection. This allows attackers to inject arbitrary SQL code.
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The content mentions that the `searchifsccode` parameter is also vulnerable to XSS-Dom.
*   **PHPSESSID Hijacking:** The content also mentions PHPSESSID hijacking is a possibility. This means an attacker could steal session cookies.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary code execution**: By exploiting the SQL injection vulnerability via the `load_file` function, an attacker can cause the application to interact with a controlled external domain and potentially leak sensitive server data.
*  **Data exfiltration:** Using the SQL injection, an attacker could potentially read sensitive data from the database or even modify or delete data.
*   **Session hijacking:** An attacker could steal and use valid PHPSESSID to impersonate a legitimate user.
*   **XSS**: An attacker could inject malicious scripts to steal cookies or perform other actions within a victim's browser session.

**Attack vectors:**

The attack vector is the vulnerable `searchifsccode` parameter in the `/search.php` script which can be accessed through an HTTP POST request with a crafted payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required.
*   The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL to inject SQL queries.
*  The attacker can craft a malicious payload that exploits the identified vulnerabilities.

**Additional information:**

*   The application uses PHP and a MySQL database.
*   The vulnerability can be exploited via time-based blind, or UNION query injection.
*   A proof-of-concept (PoC) exploit is available in Python (`PoC-SQL-Injection-all-CVE-2021-42224.py`)
* The application also appears to be vulnerable to XSS-Dom on the `searchifsccode` parameter and PHPSESSID hijacking.
* The vendor of the vulnerable application is PHPGurukul.
