SUMMARY

A security research [1] identiﬁed weaknesses in the IEEE 1735 recommended practice for encryption
of Design IP, which could allow a sophisticated attacker access to unencrypted Design IP data in IEEE
1735-compliant products. This advisory addresses the speciﬁc details for the affected Siemens software
products: Questa and ModelSim simulators.

Siemens is preparing updates and recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for Questa and ModelSim.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Company-internal use of encrypted design IP data: Apply technical and procedural measures to

ensure that access to the data is granted on a need-to-know basis.

• Companies that deliver encrypted design IP data to their customers: ensure that procedural and

contractual measures are in place that minimize the risk of unauthorized access to the data.

Product-speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Questa and ModelSim simulators are used worldwide to simulate, debug, and verify integrated circuit
designs, enabling design and veriﬁcation engineering team to accelerate time-to-market of high-quality,
high-complexity ASIC and FPGA designs.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-42023

The RSA white-box implementation in affected applications insufﬁciently protects the built-in private
keys that are required to decrypt electronic intellectual property (IP) data in accordance with the IEEE
1735 recommended practice.

This could allow a sophisticated attacker to discover the keys, bypassing the protection intended by
the IEEE 1735 recommended practice.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION

Siemens is addressing the issue in multiple phases. Questa Simulation and ModelSim Simulation are
being enhanced to contain improved design IP protection over several releases, including the use of new
keys, during 2022 and 2023.

Signiﬁcant changes in version 2022.4 (released October 2022):

• Support of customer-speciﬁc symmetric keys according to IEEE 1735
• Improvement of the white-box implementation
• Changed RSA private keys
