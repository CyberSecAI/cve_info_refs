- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The RSA white-box implementation within affected applications insufficiently protects the built-in private keys. These keys are necessary for decrypting electronic intellectual property (IP) data, as per the IEEE 1735 recommended practice.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient protection of private keys used for decrypting IP data, specifically within the RSA white-box implementation. This vulnerability is classified as CWE-522: Insufficiently Protected Credentials.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A sophisticated attacker can discover the private keys, bypassing the intended protection of the IEEE 1735 standard. This allows unauthorized access to and decryption of the protected IP data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local, requiring an attacker to have access to the affected software.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs local access to the affected software (Questa and ModelSim simulators) and must be sophisticated enough to discover the insufficiently protected private keys.

The advisory provides more details than the official CVE description by specifying the root cause as a weak RSA white-box implementation and identifying the affected software products. It also provides a CVSS v3.1 base score, vector, and CWE classification.
