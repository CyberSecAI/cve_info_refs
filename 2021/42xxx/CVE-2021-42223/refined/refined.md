{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input in the name, vaddress, and addinfo parameters when booking services.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code that will be executed in the context of an administrator's browser when they view booking details, potentially leading to session hijacking and stealing of admin cookies.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker crafts a malicious payload and injects it into the `name`, `vaddress`, and `addinfo` parameters of the booking form via a POST request to the `/odms/book-services.php` endpoint. The XSS payload then triggers when the admin views the booking details at `/odms/admin/view-booking-detail.php`.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker must be able to access the booking form and submit a crafted POST request. They do not need to be authenticated. The attacker must also have access to a server to host the malicious javascript payload."
