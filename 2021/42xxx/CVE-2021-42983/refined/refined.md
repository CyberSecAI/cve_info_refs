Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-42983:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of user-supplied buffers within the `wspvuhub.sys` and `wspusbfilter.sys` drivers, specifically related to the `METHOD_NEITHER` I/O control (IOCTL) method.
*   The driver uses IOCTL handlers 0x22005B and 0x22001B that fail to properly validate, probe, lock, and map user-provided buffers, which are then used in memory allocation and copy operations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The IOCTL handlers do not validate the size of user-supplied buffers before allocating memory and performing copy operations, which can lead to integer overflows.
*  **Insecure Arithmetic Operations:** The handlers perform insecure arithmetic on user-controlled data when calculating the `memmove` size parameter without proper overflow checks, leading to integer overflows.
*   **Double Fetches:** The vulnerability description indicates that the lack of validation opens possibilities to double fetches and arbitrary pointer dereferences (though not explicitly demonstrated in the provided code).
*   **Use of METHOD_NEITHER:** The use of `METHOD_NEITHER` in the IOCTL handlers, which requires the driver to manually handle buffer management, increases the risk of vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to escalate privileges and execute arbitrary code in kernel mode.
*   **Bypassing Security Products:** Successfully exploiting the vulnerability could allow bypassing security products.
*   **System Corruption:** An attacker can overwrite system components and corrupt the operating system.
* **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Due to the lack of validation and insecure arithmetic operations on user controlled data, the attacker can gain arbitrary code execution.
*   **Disable Security Products:** An attacker can disable security products by exploiting this vulnerability to gain kernel mode access.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The vulnerability can be triggered by any user on the system, even without administrative privileges. This is possible due to the lack of ACL enforcements on the device.
*   **IOCTL Request:** A specially crafted IOCTL request with specific buffer parameters is sent to the vulnerable driver.
*   **Sandboxes:** Due to the lack of ACL enforcements, the vulnerability can be exploited from sandboxes.
*   **Second stage browser attack:** The vulnerability may be exploited as a second stage browser attack, though browsers typically restrict IOCTL requests.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to send IOCTL requests:** An attacker must be able to send IOCTL requests to the vulnerable driver.
*   **Local access:** The attacker needs to be able to execute code on the target system.
*   **Knowledge of IOCTLs:** An attacker must know the specific IOCTL codes and how to craft input buffers to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

*   The vulnerability exists in both the client-side and server-side components, meaning that both local and remote systems are susceptible.
*   The article discusses other related CVEs impacting multiple vendors and their products that use the vulnerable Eltima SDK.
