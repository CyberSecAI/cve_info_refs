## Features

* Added a Debian package for Ubuntu 24.04 and 24.10 to the set of released packages. These packages are the first ones to support Wayland.

## Deprecations and Removals

* Minimum MacOS version has been increased to 10.15.
* Packages for Ubuntu 20.04 are no longer distributed.

## Description

An issue was discovered in Barrier before 2.4.0. The barriers component (aka the server-side implementation of Barrier) does not sufficiently verify the identify of connecting clients. Clients can thus exploit weaknesses in the provided protocol to cause denial-of-service or stage further attacks that could lead to information leaks or integrity corruption.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

Name : barrier
Product : Fedora 34
Version : 2.4.0

Description :
Barrier is software that mimics the functionality of a KVM switch, which
historically would allow you to use a single keyboard and mouse to control

which machine to control by moving your mouse to the edge of the screen,
or by using a key press to switch focus to a different system.

Description :
Barrier is software that mimics the functionality of a KVM switch, which
historically would allow you to use a single keyboard and mouse to control
multiple computers. Barrier does this in software, allowing you to tell it
which machine to control by moving your mouse to the edge of the screen,
or by using a key press to switch focus to a different system.

## Description

An issue was discovered in Barrier before 2.4.0. An attacker can enter an active session state with the barriers component (aka the server-side implementation of Barrier) simply by supplying a client label that identifies a valid client configuration. This label is "Unnamed" by default but could instead be guessed from hostnames or other publicly available information. In the active session state, an attacker can capture input device events from the server, and also modify the clipboard content on the server.

Subject: Barrier "software KVM switch" multiple remote security issues

Hello list,

recently the Barrier project [1] published new releases that address a couple
of security issues I reported to them. Following is the full review report I
shared with upstream on 2021-07-30. Attached to this email is a tarball
containing reproducer scripts that are mentioned in the report.

[1]: <https://github.com/debauchee/barrier>

I. Introduction
===============

Barrier is a software based approach to a "KVM" switch. It allows keyboard
and mouse physically connected to one computer to be shared with other
computers via the network. It is an open source project that has been forked
from the commercial "Synergy" [2] software.

[2]: <https://symless.com/synergy>

Barrier is implemented in the C++ programming language. The following sections
give a rough overview of the Barrier design for people that are unfamiliar
with it.

1) Barrier Components
---------------------

Barrier consists of three executables that are all executed with user
privileges in the context of a graphical user session:

- `barriers` is the server side command line executable. It is run on the
  machine that shares its physically connected mouse and keyboard.
- `barrierc` is the client side command line executable. It is used to allow a
  remote server to control the client machine with the server's input devices.
- `barrier` is a graphical user interface to both the server and the client
  aspects of Barrier. It can configure the server mode or run in client mode
  to grant session access to a remote server.

Barrier features cross platform support for Microsoft Windows, Linux and some
BSDs in conjunction with a classical X11 server or MacOS. For the purposes of
this review I only looked into the Linux port.

2) The Barrier Network Protocol
-------------------------------

Barrier uses a custom TCP stream based protocol that by default runs over TCP
port 24800. Each node attempts to read a complete message from the stream that
at the lowest level consists of a four byte header containing an unsigned
32-bit integer in network byte order denoting the number of bytes the message
payload consists of:

    #########################################################
    # 4-byte length in network byte order # message payload #
    #########################################################

The message payload typically starts with a four character message type field
(with the exception of the Hello message). The known message types are found
in source file `src/lib/barrier/protocol_types.cpp`. The message types in the
source code constants are followed by a `scanf`-like syntax denoting any
integer or string parameters that are expected to follow the message type
field.

The details of the parameter handling on the lower level can be found in the
source code functions `vreadf()` for the receiving side and `writef()` for the
sending side.

Each individual message type is parsed on the receiving end in the context of
a Proxy class instance. The server program starts out with
`ClientProxyUnknown` and later on turns control over to one of
`ClientProxy1_0` to `ClientProxy1_6` depending on the protocol version that is
indicated by a client. The client program uses the `ServerProxy` class to
handle incoming messages received from the server.

### SSL Encryption

The Barrier protocol can run unencrypted and unauthorized using plaintext TCP
connections. This approach, by design, is insecure and can only be used in
completely trusted networks.

By default the `barrier` GUI interface preconfigures SSL-based network
operation. For this purpose both the client and server components use
self-signed SSL certificates to create openSSL based connections with each
other. Details of the SSL security will be covered in the review results for
the client and server side individually in sections II. 1a) and II. 2a).

II. Review Results
==================

Since Barrier is a networking program that grants full user level access to
other machines it has been an interesting target for a security review. For
the purpose of my review I looked into both the client and server side
security of Barrier version 2.3.3 in openSUSE Linux Tumbleweed (see also
openSUSE Bugzilla entry [3]).

For practical testing I wrote prototypical Python scripts (`barrier_client.py`,
`barrier_server.py`) that implement part of Barrier's network protocol. Where
applicable I will point out reproducers based on these scripts. The scripts are
licensed under ISC and can be used or adapted by others to help with
fixing any issues found in this report or to further analyse Barrier's
security. You can find them in the attached tarball file.

[3]: <https://bugzilla.suse.com/show_bug.cgi?id=1188922>

1) Client Side Security
-----------------------

### a) SSL Verification

After an SSL based connection has been established with the server process the
first thing the client code does is comparing the server's certificate
fingerprint against a local text based fingerprint database in
`$HOME/.local/share/barrier/SSL/Fingerprints/TrustedServers.txt`. This happens
in `SecureSocket::verifyCertFingerprint()`.

SHA1 fingerprints are used for this purpose which is not consindered state of
the art any more especially for certificates that have a large degree of
freedom in its format for performing collision attacks. This should be changed
to use SHA256 based fingerprints.

When the fingerprint does not match a trusted fingerprint in the local
database, then the SSL connection is immediately terminated by the client
code, so no further attack surface should be available at this stage.

The mechanism to actually trust a server's fingerprint is found in the
`barrier` GUI application. The GUI parses the log output of the `barrierc`
client program and if the log indicates that the server's fingerprint is
untrusted then it presents a popup dialog to the user showing the server's
fingerprint and instructing it to compare it against the server's fingerprint.
When the `barrier` GUI runs in server mode then the local server's SSL
fingerprint is displayed prominently to the user so it should be fairly clear
what to do.

The log parsing logic in the GUI component is a bit peculiar (as is also noted
in the comment in `MainWindow::updateFromLogLine()`) but this should not hurt
the involved security.

While the graphical UI provided by `barrier` by default configures SSL
security, the console programs `barrierc` and `barriers` do not use SSL by
default, but only when `--enable-crypto` is passed as a command line switch.
It would be better to make SSL the default there, too. Disabling SSL in the
GUI or on the command line should be warned about clearly.

Once the client trusts the server based on the fingerprint, further security
review of later stages of the protocol are not strictly necessary, since the
client grants the server full control of its graphical session anyway. For
completeness and in the sense of a defense in depth approach I looked a bit
further anyway, as can be seen in the following sections.

### b) High Memory Usage when Server Sends a lot Keepalive Messages

When the server sends a lot of keepalive messages to the client ("CALV"
message type) then a memory leak or delayed deletion of messages in the client
causes a significant amount of memory usage over time (it happens rather slow
though).

### c) Set Options Message without Size Limit

The "DSOP" message type transmits an array of integers to the client. There is
no size limit to this array, which could allow a server to allocate an
arbitrary amount (up to 2^32 - 1 bytes) of heap memory in the client, leading
to denial of service. I did not actually test this though.

### d) Message Parsing Results are not Checked

A lot of the messages parsed in the client code (`ServerProxy` class) that are
parsed via `readf()` are not checked for the return values. This means if the
protocol is not followed correctly and parsing errors occur, then the logic in
ServerProxy will operate on potentially undefined data.

Example: in `ServerProxy::keyUp()` an error return from
`ProtocolUtil::readf()` is not checked for. If an error occurs then the stack
variables `id`, `mask` and `button` are unitialized.

2) Server Side Security
-----------------------

### a) SSL Verification (CVE-2021-42072)

Contrary to the client side, the server does not verify client connections in
any way. Since the server is taking over control of the client this may seem
enough at first glance. However it means that the SSL connection
does not add any authenticy or authentication for the server side. The server
process thus provides attack surface to any member of the attached network.

### b) Failure to Complete SSL Handshake

This is not stricly a security issue but a regular bug. Many connection
attempts fail to establish, the server seems to be stuck in an
`SSL_ERROR_WANT_READ` loop resulting from the improper use of non-blocking
sockets [4].

[4]: <https://github.com/openssl/openssl/issues/10279>

This also creates a high load on the server side so it could be seen as a kind
of denial of service attack vector, too.

This can be tested via the test script, where I added a timeout of 2.5 seconds
for the SSL operation to complete. Every now and then the connection to the
server will fail like this:

    $ barrier_client.py $REMOTE
    /usr/lib/python3.9/ssl.py:1309: _ssl.c:1128: The handshake operation timed out

### c) Missing Limitation of Message Length (CVE-2021-42076)

There is no check against overlong messages being sent by clients, so we can
send up to 2^32 - 1 bytes, causing unauthenticated remote denial of service
via excessive heap memory allocations. Multiple connections can be used to
abuse this in parallel and cause even higher memory allocation, if necessary.

The same should be true to client side message reception only that it is
authenticated via the server's SHA1 fingerprint.

#### Reproducer

Tested against a host with 3 GB of memory:

    $ barrier_client.py $REMOTE --send-infinite-message
    [...]
    Sent 1.51 gigabytes of data
    /usr/lib/python3.9/ssl.py:1173: [Errno 104] Connection reset by peer

Output on the server side:

    $ /usr/bin/barriers -f --no-tray --debug INFO --name myhost \
                        --enable-crypto -c /tmp/Barrier.OIQszt
    [...]

                   UID:1000 pgtables:4952kB oom_score_adj:0

### d) The Server does not Correctly Close Connections (CVE-2021-42075)

The daemon does not correctly close client sockets causing permanent file
descriptor exhaustion and thus remote denial of service within a couple of
seconds by just opening and closing connections.

After 1023 file descriptors are open the server will still react to connection
requests, but will fail to open its own local certificate and thus close
the connection prematurely. This issue could be used as an additional attack
vector during other stages of the protocol to trigger file/socket open
failures with potentially security related effects.

#### Reproducer

### e) SIGSEGV on quick Connection Open/Close Sequence while Sending Hello Message (CVE-2021-42074)

When quickly opening and closing socket connections while sending a Hello
message for each session then this will lead to a segmentation fault (probably
use after free). This allows for a simple way to DoS the barrier server for
an unauthenticated remote client. Further research of the supposed use after
free might show more severe implications in the direction of executing code on
the server.

#### Reproducer

Client side:

    $ barrier_client.py $REMOTE --run-hello-loop
    Running connection loop with Hello exchange

### f) Knowing a Valid Client Name Allows Information Leaks and Server Manipulation (CVE-2021-42073)

Any client can connect to the server process without any end user visible sign
on the server side. The client can choose an arbitrary protocol version which
results in the corresponding `ClientProxy1_X` class being instantiated, for
X in the range of 0..6. This allows for many different attack angles for each
of the minor protocol versions that are difficult to keep track of given the
overloading of individual protocol handling functions by the different proxy
classes that inherit from the next lower proxy class, respectively.

In the initial Hello message the client specifies its name as a free form
string. This name must match one of the configured client names on the server
(processing of this starts in `ClientProxyUnknown::handleData()`). If the
client is unknown to the server then the session will be terminated with an
"EUNK" error reply. If the client of the given name is already connected, then
an "EBSY" error reply is sent.

By default, newly added clients in the `barrier` GUI application on the server
side get assigned the name "Unnamed". When an attacker knows a valid client
name then it can specify this name in its Hello message and will be able to
enter a fully active session state. In this state the client can receive input
device events from the server, claim the clipboard or even inject arbitrary
new clipboard content on the server.

Relying on a piece of simple string label information for limiting access to
the server is not enough security-wise. Client names might be left unchanged
by users ("Unnamed") or they might be derived from network hostnames that are
visible in cleartext when listening in on the network (e.g. DNS requests, DHCP
requests etc).

#### Reproducer

Supposing the default client name "Unnamed" is configured on the server a
valid reproducer looks like this one the client:

    $ ./barrier_client.py vm-tw --client-name Unnamed \
        --send-clipboard "test content" --minor-version 6

This should result in a valid session being established and the string "test
content" being written to the server's clipboard.

### g) Mismatched free / delete / delete[]

According to some tests using `valgrind` the memory management in the context
of the EventQueue during connect/disconnect cycles is sometimes inconsistent.

    ==5773== Mismatched free() / delete / delete []
    ==5773==    at 0x484117B: free (in /usr/libexec/valgrind/vgpreload_memcheck-amd64-linux.so)

    ==5773==    by 0x128CDD: main (barriers.cpp:56)

More thorough tests of Barrier using valgrind and other memory checking
utilities (e.g. `-fsanitize=address`) should be performed to find invisible
errors in the network processing code.

The EventQueue mechanism seems especially hard to follow in my opinion, and
makes reading the code difficult, because the code flow is goto-like by the
use of weakly typed events that follow a custom scheme as opposed to e.g. the
Qt library event mechanism.

### h) Statically Allocated Objects in Session Handling

In some places statically allocated objects are reused possibly between
different sessions. For example in `FileChunk::assemble()` and
`ClientProxy1_6::recvClipboard()`.

Session specific data should always be kept in session related contextual
data, not in global data structures.

### i) DFTR File Transfer Message

DFTR for sending files once more allows to allocate a large amount of heap
memory. The Server class only processes the data when `--enable-drag-drop`
is passed on the command line, but for Linux it is hard-disabled, because it
is unsupported. Otherwise the data would be stored somewhere on the server
probably (could play into item 2f) on supported platforms).

### j) DCLP Processing in IClipboard::unmarshall() is Unsafe

The processing of DCLP messages in `IClipboard::unmarshall()` is not safe
against crafted / corrupted data. The function will read past the end of the
receive buffer (`numFormats` is not sanitized), resulting in a segfault, maybe
also in an information leak, if the unauthorized client can retrieve the
clipboard "content" back (this could weaken e.g. ASLR, stack canary protection
etc.).

3) Summary
----------

It is clear that the security emphasis in Barrier lies on the verification of
the server towards the client. This is natural given that the client hands
over graphical session control to the server. Since the server also offers a
rich API towards clients it is necessary to perform some form of proper mutual
authentication, however. Fingerprints should be upgraded to SHA256 to avoid
the now weak SHA1 digest algorithm.

Defense in depth needs to be improved by diligently parsing incoming messages
and avoiding races. The event queue mechanism seems overly complex and old
school to me, which could be one of the reasons for some of the issues on
the server side, because the call structure, number of threads and
multithreading guarantees etc. are not very clear from reading the code.

Given the current state of the software I would consider it a major security
risk running the Barrier server in any network that is not completely trusted.

4) Action Items / Recommendations / Upstream Fixes
--------------------------------------------------

- `barriers` needs to verify the authenticity of connecting clients (items 2a,
  2f). This got addressed via upstream PR#1346 [5].
- For checking SSL certificate fingerprints SHA256 should be used (item 1a).
  This got addressed via upstream PR#1343 [6].
- Maximum message size limits should be enforced (items 1c, 2c, 2i). This got
  addressed via upstream PR#1347 [7].
- Maximum receive buffer / message backlog should be enforced (item 1b)
- Cleanly close socket file descriptors on the server side (item 2d). This got
  addressed via upstream PR#1350 [8].
- Fix race condition (?) to avoid invalid memory access (item 2e). This got
  addressed via upstream PR#1351 [9].
- Parsing errors should be diligently checked for (item 1d)
- Out of bound memory access needs to be prevented (item 2j)
- Non-blocking operation of SSL sockets needs to be fixed (item 2b)
- Apply quality assurance by using tools like Valgrind, Address Sanitizer
  (item 2g). In the long term maybe refactor / improve the EventQueue
  mechanism.
- Remove hacky static variables (item 2h)

Upstream told me that the remaining recommendations will be worked on during
the next months. Upstream release v2.4.0 [10] contains all mentioned fixes
including incompatible ones (using SHA-256 fingerprints, authenticating
clients). Upstream release v2.3.4 [11] contains only the backward compatible
fixes and thus still no client authentication. Updating to version v2.4.0 is
thus strongly recommended.

- 2021-07-30: report shared with upstream, I offered an embargo of maximum 90
  days according to the openSUSE security policy.
- 2021-08-02, 2021-08-03: initial discussions about the project structure and
  who of the maintainers can take care of the issues.
- 2021-08-16: one of the upstream developers confirmed his willingness to
  address the issues, no clear publication date could be established.
- 2021-10-08: in coordination with upstream I obtained CVEs from Mitre for the
  most serious findings and communicated them to upstream. It has become
  apparent by now that the full 90 days embargo period will be required.
- 2021-10-27: With the maximum embargo period ending we agreed on publication
  in the following days. Upstream providing new releases with the most
  pressing fixes.

Barrier upstream obviously suffers from a lack of developer resources. I want
to thank upstream developer Povilas Kanapickas for investing the effort to at
least fix the more serious findings and for providing releases before the end
of the maximum 90 days embargo period.

Cheers

Matthias

Product : Fedora 35
Version : 2.4.0

Summary : Use a single keyboard and mouse to control multiple computers
Description :
Barrier is software that mimics the functionality of a KVM switch, which
historically would allow you to use a single keyboard and mouse to control
multiple computers. Barrier does this in software, allowing you to tell it
which machine to control by moving your mouse to the edge of the screen,
or by using a key press to switch focus to a different system.

# WARNING

**Barrier is no longer maintained and no longer receives improvements and security fixes. The primary developers have moved to the [InputLeap project](https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap). The newest release of InputLeap is [3.0.2](https://github.com/input-leap/input-leap/releases/tag/v3.0.2)**

## Security fixes

* Barrier now supports client identity verification (fixes [CVE-2021-42072](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-wvmp-5fvm-29ff "CVE-2021-42072"), [CVE-2021-42073](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-fm32-wgpg-7rc9 "CVE-2021-42073")).

  Previously a malicious client could connect to Barrier server without any authentication and send application-level messages. This made the attack surface of Barrier significantly larger. Additionally, in case the malicious client got possession of a valid screen name by brute forcing or other means it could modify the clipboard contents of the server.

  To support seamless upgrades from older versions of Barrier this is currently disabled by default. The feature can be enabled in the settings dialog. If enabled, older clients of Barrier will be rejected.
* Barrier now uses SHA256 fingerprints for establishing security of encrypted SSL connections. After upgrading client to new version the existing server fingerprint will need to be approved again. Client and server will show both SHA1 and SHA256 server fingerprints to allow interoperability with older versions of Barrier.

All of the above security issues have been reported by Matthias Gerstner who was really helpful for resolving them.

## Bug fixes

* Fixed build failure on mips\*el and riscv64 architecture.
* Fixed reading of configuration on Windows when the paths contain non-ASCII characters ([#976](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/976), [#974](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/974), [#444](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/444)).
* Barrier no longer uses openssl CLI tool for any operations and hooks into the openssl library directly.
* More X11 clipboard MIME types have been mapped to corresponding converters ([#344](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/344)).
* Fixed setup of multiple actions associated with a hotkey.
* Fixed setup of hotkeys with special characters such as comma and semicolon ([#778](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/778)).
* Fixed transfer of non-ASCII characters coming from a Windows server in certain cases ([#527](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/527)).
* Barrier will now regenerate server certificate if it's invalid instead of failing to launch ([#802](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/802))
* Added support for additional keys on Sun Microsystems USB keyboards ([#784](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/784)).
* Updated Chinese translation.
* Updated Slovak translation.
* Theme icons are now preferred to icons distributed together with Barrier ([#471](https://github.com/debauchee/barrier/issues/471)).
* Fixed incorrect setup of Barrier service path on Windows.

## Features

* Added `--drop-target` option that improves drag and drop support on Windows when Barrier is being run as a portable app.
* The `--enable-crypto` command line option has been made the default to reduce chances of accidental security mishaps when configuring Barrier from command line. A new `--disable-crypto` command line option has been added to explicitly disable encryption.
* Added support for randomart images for easier comparison of SSL certificate fingerprints. The algorithm is identical to what OpenSSH uses.
* Implemented a configuration option for Server GUI auto-start.
* Made it possible to use keyboard instead of mouse to modify screen layout.
* Added support for keyboard backlight media keys
* Added support for Eisu\_toggle and Muhenkan keys
* Added `--profile-dir` option that allows to select custom profile directory.

v2.4.0 includes all bug fixes and features that were part of v2.3.4.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also¬† adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot¬† throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization‚Äôs codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer‚Äôs knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses ‚Äì rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. ‚Äì you should continue these policies with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot‚Äôs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You‚Äôre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot‚Äôs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section.

Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot‚Äôs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You‚Äôre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot‚Äôs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.
