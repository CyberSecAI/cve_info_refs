Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Zammad application fetches data from a REST API to display information about various models (Tickets, Users, Groups, etc.). The API responses may contain data that should not be visible to the requester.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Information Leak:** The vulnerability is an information leak, where internal data is exposed through the REST API.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker could gain access to sensitive information that they should not normally be able to see. This could include potentially confidential details within tickets, user information, or group details.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the REST API.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to send requests to the Zammad REST API.
- It's implied that the attacker would need to be an authenticated user since the API is used to display data related to the logged-in user context, but the advisory doesn't mention whether the attack is possible by unauthenticated attackers.

**Affected Versions:**
- Zammad versions 1.0.x up to 4.1.0

**Fixed Versions:**
- Zammad 4.1.1 and 5.0.0
