  "CVE-2021-42046": {
    "related": true,
    "summary": "The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the GlobalWatchlist extension for MediaWiki.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The `watchlistUtils.makeUserLinks` function in the GlobalWatchlist extension uses `mw.msg` to construct HTML links. The function does not escape the output of `mw.msg` which returns raw HTML. This allows for injection of malicious script by manipulating messages like `rev-deleted-user` or `ntimes`.",
      "vulnerabilities": [
        "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser, leading to potential session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.",
      "attack_vectors": "The attack vector is through manipulation of MediaWiki messages (specifically `rev-deleted-user` or `ntimes`) which are used by `watchlistUtils.makeUserLinks`. An attacker could modify these messages to include malicious JavaScript.",
       "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need the ability to modify the MediaWiki messages, which typically requires elevated privileges (e.g. admin or interface editor) on a targeted wiki."
