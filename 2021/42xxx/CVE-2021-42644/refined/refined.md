The provided content describes two vulnerabilities in CmsEasy version 7.7.5_20211012: an arbitrary file write vulnerability and an arbitrary file read vulnerability.

**Arbitrary File Write Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `lib/admin/template_admin.php` file. The `sid` parameter, when crafted with path traversal sequences (`.._d_` which translates to `../`), bypasses sanitization and allows writing to arbitrary locations using `file_put_contents`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient sanitization of the `sid` parameter, allowing path traversal. The use of `file_put_contents` without proper validation of the target path and file content.
*  **Impact:** Arbitrary code execution by writing a malicious PHP file (e.g., webshell) to the web server's document root, leading to complete compromise of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/index.php?case=template&act=save&admin_dir=admin&site=default` with the `sid` parameter containing path traversal sequences and the `scontent` parameter containing the PHP code to be written.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin user.
    *   The attacker needs to know the target web server address.

**Arbitrary File Read Vulnerability:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is located in the same `lib/admin/template_admin.php` file. The `id` parameter, when crafted with path traversal sequences, allows reading arbitrary files using `file_get_contents`.
*   **Weaknesses:** Insufficient sanitization of the `id` parameter, allowing path traversal. The use of `file_get_contents` without proper validation of the target file path.
*   **Impact:** Information disclosure by reading sensitive files, such as configuration files containing database credentials, which could lead to further compromise of the system.
*   **Attack Vectors:** Sending a crafted POST request to `/index.php?case=template&act=fetch&admin_dir=admin&site=default` with the `id` parameter containing path traversal sequences to the desired file.
*    **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated as an admin user.
    *   The attacker needs to know the target web server address.
