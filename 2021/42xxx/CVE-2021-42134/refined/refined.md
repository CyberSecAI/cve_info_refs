{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Inadequate handling of user-provided data in the `django-unicorn` library, specifically when rendering component variables and kwargs, allowing for potential XSS attacks.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Cross-site Scripting (XSS)"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation of the XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or defacement of the website.",
  "Attack vectors": "An attacker could inject malicious HTML or JavaScript code via component variables or kwargs. This code would then be rendered by the application, leading to the execution of the injected script in the user's browser.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to control or influence the data used within the django-unicorn components' variables or kwargs. This could be achieved by manipulating user input fields that are directly or indirectly used by the component."
