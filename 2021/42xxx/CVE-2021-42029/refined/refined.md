- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Incorrect handling of the webserver's user management configuration during downloading, leading to improper access control.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper Access Control (CWE-284). Specifically, the web server user permissions are not correctly set when using affected versions of TIA Portal.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could achieve privilege escalation on the web server of affected devices. This would allow the attacker to potentially access and modify data or settings via the web interface.
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs direct access to the impacted web server.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker requires direct access to the web server and the ability to interact with it. This also requires the use of specific TIA Portal versions to configure the webserver.  The CVSS vector indicates that the attack requires high privileges, is complex, requires user interaction, and has an impact on confidentiality, integrity and availability, with an exploit code proof of concept.
