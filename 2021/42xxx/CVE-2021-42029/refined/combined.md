Improper Access Control Vulnerability in TIA Portal
SSA-350757:
Affecting S7-1200 and S7-1500 CPUs Web Server (Incl. Related
ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants)

SUMMARY

An attacker could achieve privilege escalation on the web server of certain devices conﬁgured by SIMATIC
STEP 7 (TIA Portal) due to incorrect handling of the webserver’s user management conﬁguration during
downloading. This only affects the S7-1200 and S7-1500 CPUs’ (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS
variants) web server, when activated.

Siemens has released updates for several affected products and recommends to update to the latest
versions. Siemens recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet
available.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Whenever changes of the web server’s user conﬁguration are performed with one of the affected
versions for S7-1200 or S7-1500 CPUs (incl. related ET200 CPUs and SIPLUS variants), validate
web server permissions for unauthenticated users by directly accessing the web server in an
In case unauthenticated access is unintentionally possible, the web
unauthenticated manner.
server’s user conﬁguration needs to be removed and reconﬁgured again using a TIA-Portal V16
Update 5 or V17 Update 2 or later

• In case a new TIA-Portal version is not available, updating the web server’s user conﬁguration is not

effective in this situation. Instead

– the PLC must be deleted and reconﬁgured with a new project. Warning: The PLC-program

should be copied before deleting the PLC. Or

- the original project (one that was not uploaded by a PLC) should be used to update the web
server’s user management and to download the changed conﬁguration

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SIMATIC STEP 7 (TIA Portal) is an engineering software to conﬁgure and program SIMATIC controllers.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-42029

An attacker could achieve privilege escalation on the web server of certain devices due to improper
access control vulnerability in the engineering system software. The attacker needs to have direct
access to the impacted web server.
