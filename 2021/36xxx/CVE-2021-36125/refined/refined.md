  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-36125",
    "description": "The Special:GlobalRenameRequest page in MediaWiki extensions can cause a denial of service. The page suggests a new username by appending three random digits to the user's current username. However, the system does not check the username length against the maximum allowable length, resulting in an infinite loop and denial of service if a user has a long username.",
    "technical_details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability is caused by an infinite loop when generating a suggested username during a global rename request. The system attempts to append three random digits to the current username without verifying if the new username will exceed the maximum allowed length.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of input validation for username length when generating suggested usernames.",
         "Infinite loop vulnerability leading to denial-of-service."
      ],
      "impact": "A user with a long username (83 characters or more) can cause a denial-of-service condition. This happens when the system gets stuck in an infinite loop while trying to generate a valid suggested username.",
        "attack_vectors": [
           "An attacker with an account with a long username can trigger the infinite loop by initiating the global rename request.",
           "A user with a long username (>= 83 chars) can initiate a rename request, causing a denial of service"
          ],
        "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs a user account with a long username (83 characters or more)."
    },
      "remediation": "The suggested username feature was modified to avoid the infinite loop. This was done by adding a counter and stopping after a set number of tries to generate the username. Patches were deployed to versions 1.35, 1.36 and master branch of MediaWiki extensions. CentralAuth."
