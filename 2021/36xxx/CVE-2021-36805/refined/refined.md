Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-36805:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The Akaunting application allows HTML in the footer of a sales invoice.
- The application's built-in "firewall" for preventing malicious code is bypassed.
- Specifically, a specially crafted HTML payload with a `>` character in the `class` attribute bypasses the regex filter.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  Malicious HTML/JavaScript code can be injected into the invoice footer. The injected code is stored and executed when other users view the invoice, leading to a persistent XSS vulnerability.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization/Validation:** The application's input validation mechanism is inadequate, allowing a specially crafted payload to bypass the filtering.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browsers of users who view the compromised invoice.
- **Account Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially steal cookies or other session data, leading to account compromise.
- **Malicious actions:**  The attacker can perform malicious actions on behalf of the victim, such as redirecting users to phishing sites, or modifying data within the application.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Web Interface:** The attacker uses the web interface of the application to modify invoice footers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the Akaunting platform.
- **Privileges:** The attacker needs to have permissions to add or modify sales invoices within the platform.
