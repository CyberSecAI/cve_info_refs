Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36584:

**Root Cause:**
- A heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `gp_rtp_builder_do_tx3g` function within the `ietf/rtp_pck_3gpp.c` file of the GPAC library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-based buffer overflow:** The code attempts to read data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap, specifically a 1-byte read out of bounds. This is triggered when processing TX3G data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The heap-buffer-overflow leads to a crash of the application, effectively resulting in a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing a specially crafted media file using MP4Box, a tool within the GPAC library. Specifically, this occurs when the `-hint` option is used and processing TX3G data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to provide a specially crafted media file that will be processed by GPAC's MP4Box tool. The attacker needs to have the ability to execute MP4Box with the malicious input, possibly through a user interaction that causes the application to process the file.

**Code Snippet (from the provided content):**

```c
396	pay_start = 2;
397	if (txt_size>2) {
398		/*seems 3GP only accepts BE UTF-16 (no LE, no UTF32)*/
399		if (((u8) data[2]==(u8) 0xFE) && ((u8) data[3]==(u8) 0xFF)) {
400			is_utf_16 = GF_TRUE;
401			pay_start = 4;
402			txt_size -= 2;
403		}
404	}
405	samp_size = data_size - pay_start;
```

The overflow occurs at line 399. It's trying to read data[2] and data[3], which will be out of bounds if data_size is less than 4, and txt_size > 2.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was reported by a user named `dhbbb` on GitHub and assigned CVE-2021-36584.
*   The issue was fixed in commit `13442ec1c401a4181ba6d7f79c27df6054c817c7`.
