Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-36983:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from the insecure implementation of the `replay-sorcery-kms` systemd service in ReplaySorcery v0.6.0. Specifically, the service uses a predictable path `/tmp/replay-sorcery/device.sock` for its UNIX domain socket and uses `chmod(path, 0777)` on the directory and socket file, which opens up several attack vectors.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

1.  **Predictable Socket Path:** The service creates a UNIX domain socket at `/tmp/replay-sorcery/device.sock`. Since `/tmp` is world-writable, an attacker can create the `/tmp/replay-sorcery` directory and control its contents, including the socket file, before the service starts.
2.  **Insecure `chmod()` Usage:** The `kmsChmod()` function, which uses `chmod(path, 0777)`, is called on both `/tmp/replay-sorcery` and `/tmp/replay-sorcery/device.sock`. This makes it possible for a local attacker to use symlink attacks. Although the kernel's symlink protection thwarts symlink attacks on the directory itself, the lack of a sticky bit on `/tmp/replay-sorcery` allows for a race condition attack on the socket file. The attacker can create a symlink at `/tmp/replay-sorcery/device.sock` to a file under their control and then wait for the service to start and perform the `chmod` and `chown`.
3.  **Missing Client Authorization:** The service doesn't verify if a client is authorized to access the local display. Any local process can potentially connect to the socket and access display content of logged-in users.
4.  **Unbounded Memory Allocation:** The service doesn't limit the `deviceLength` parameter in the `RSServiceDeviceInfo` data structure received from clients which allows for denial of service attacks via excessive memory allocation

**Impact of Exploitation:**

1.  **Local Root Exploit:** By exploiting the race condition described in (2), an attacker can gain root privileges.
2.  **Arbitrary Socket Communication:** By pre-creating `/tmp/replay-sorcery/device.sock` before the service starts, an attacker can intercept and control the communication between clients and the service.
3.  **Information Disclosure:** By connecting to the service, unprivileged local processes could access the display content of other users, potentially leaking sensitive information.
4.  **Denial of Service:** Malicious clients can cause excessive memory allocation by sending large values for `deviceLength`, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** All attacks require local access to the system.
*   **Race Condition:** The root exploit relies on winning a race condition when the service starts up, between the service binding the socket and performing the chown() operations.
*   **Socket Manipulation:** The attacker creates and controls the directory and socket file within `/tmp`.
*   **Network socket connection**: Local processes connect to the service's UNIX domain socket.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local User Account:** An attacker needs a regular user account on the target system.
*   **Ability to create files and directories** The attacker has to be able to create files and directories on `/tmp`.
