{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The PIN authentication mechanism in the Samourai Wallet application is weak due to a lack of proper rate limiting and a relatively simple key derivation process. The PIN, which is the sole requirement to unlock the wallet, can be bypassed by restarting the application, resetting the failure counter. Furthermore, the key used to decrypt the wallet is derived by concatenating a static GUID (stored in plaintext) with the user's PIN, followed by a PBKDF2-HMAC-SHA256 key derivation with only 15,000 iterations. This makes it feasible to brute-force the PIN.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Lack of proper rate limiting on PIN attempts.",
    "Use of a static GUID concatenated with the PIN for key derivation.",
    "Insufficient PBKDF2 iterations (15,000) for key derivation.",
    "Weak PIN complexity requirements (5 to 8 digits).",
    "PIN failure counter is stateless and can be reset by restarting the application.",
    "GUID stored in plaintext in shared preferences."
   ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker who gains access to the device storage can brute-force the PIN and decrypt the wallet, leading to complete control over the user's Bitcoin funds.",
  "Attack vectors": [
    "Physical access to the device.",
    "Malware installation on the device.",
    "Seizure of the device by law enforcement."
  ],
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to have access to the device's internal storage to retrieve the 'samourai.dat' file and the GUID from the shared preferences file. They also need the ability to run a brute-force attack."
