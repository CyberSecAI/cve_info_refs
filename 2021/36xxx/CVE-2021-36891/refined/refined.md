Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-36891:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Photo Gallery by Supsystic plugin for WordPress, in versions 1.15.5 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CSRF vulnerability allows attackers to induce authenticated users to perform unwanted actions on their behalf.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute actions that they did not intend, potentially leading to unauthorized modifications of the plugin settings, content, or other sensitive operations. The specific impact would vary depending on the actions that can be triggered via the plugin's CSRF vulnerable functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves crafting a malicious request that targets a vulnerable function in the plugin, then tricking an authenticated user into executing this request. This could be achieved by social engineering methods like phishing, embedding the request within a malicious website, or another form of injecting content where an authenticated user would trigger it, for example in a post or comment.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability, as the goal is to make an authenticated user execute a malicious action. The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious request, and deliver it to a logged-in user.
- The attacker needs to be able to lure the target into triggering the crafted request (e.g. visiting a malicious website, clicking a malicious link etc)

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is considered to have a "low severity impact" and is "unlikely to be exploited".
- The vulnerability has been fixed in version 1.15.6 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is categorized under OWASP Top 10 A5: Broken Access Control.
