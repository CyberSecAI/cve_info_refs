How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

* **[Pagination Feature](https://supsystic.com/example/pagination-gallery-example?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=pagination&utm_campaign=gallery "Pagination")** lets you to display images on multiple pages, thus speed up your load time as well and make it easy to browse your gallery for users.
* **[Lazy load Feature](https://supsystic.com/documentation/lazy-load?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=lazyload&utm_campaign=gallery "Lazy load")** is a great way to lower the loading time and display all content at once. Using this option for image and video galleries, we decrease initial page load time and weight, and system resource usage in general, that have positive effect on performance.

### Do I need to have coding skills to use Photo Gallery?

Absolutely not. You can create and customize beautiful image and video galleries without any coding knowledge. We made it super easy.

### Will this Gallery plugin work with my theme?

Yes, Photo Gallery is a popular and well-established WordPress gallery plugin, and has been for a long time. It will work well with most other WordPress themes and plugins.

### Are the galleries mobile friendly?

Yes, we’ve put a lot of work into this. Photo Galleries are responsive and look good on diverse screen sizes.

[Responsive mode](https://supsystic.com/documentation/gallery-responsive-mode?utm_source=wordpress&utm_medium=responsive&utm_campaign=gallery "Responsive mode") in Photo Gallery plugin is enable by default.

### How to add a watermark to the my photos?

It was a great gallery plugin. But breaking it just for charging users without advise is not fair.I understand developping a plugin is time consuming and everybodies offering a service need a retribution related to it. But can’t you make it progressively without taking people in hostage ?2024 11 26

This used to be a great plugin and I used it extensively on my website. However, in late 2023, they arbitrarily decided to remove a key feature from the free version and start charging for it. The feature was the ability to have a link in gallery images that would take you to a larger version of the image, or another page with more information about the image. Those links no longer work. They claim that they notified users and offered a discount before doing that, but I received no such notification and even if I had, I consider it unacceptable. Now my website is completely broken. I no longer trust them and neither should you. This is essentially a bait-and-switch to force you to buy their pro version after investing hundreds of hours in creating a website with their free version.
