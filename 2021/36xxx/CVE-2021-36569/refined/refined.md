Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The FUEL CMS version 1.4.13 is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF:** The application does not properly validate the origin of requests, allowing an attacker to forge requests on behalf of a logged-in user.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Account Deletion:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to delete a user account by crafting a malicious request to `/users/delete/2` (or other user IDs).

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to entice a logged-in user to click a malicious link or visit a malicious website. The malicious website would then send the forged request to the vulnerable FUEL CMS application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a valid request for deleting a user account.
- The attacker must trick a logged-in user into interacting with the malicious request. This could be achieved via phishing, malicious websites, etc.
- The attacker does not need direct access to the server or the application code.
