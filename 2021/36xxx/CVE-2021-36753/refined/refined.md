Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-36753:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `bat` utility, on Windows, was using `Command::new` in a way that would execute programs from the current working directory (CWD) in addition to the system's PATH.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **CWE-427: Uncontrolled Search Path Element:** The application was not strictly controlling the search path when looking for executables, resulting in the CWD being implicitly included as a location to search for executables. This allowed an attacker to place a malicious executable with the same name as a program `bat` would execute (e.g., `less.exe`) into the CWD, and `bat` would execute that malicious file instead of the intended legitimate program.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary program execution:** An attacker could gain arbitrary code execution on the user's system by placing a malicious executable in a directory where a user was running `bat`.
- An attacker could potentially gain full control over a user's machine if the malicious program had admin privileges or could leverage existing privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to place a malicious executable in the current working directory of the user running `bat`.
- The malicious executable would need to have the same name as an executable that `bat` calls such as `less` or `less.exe`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs write access to a directory where a user will execute `bat`
-  An attacker must be able to create/place a malicious program named the same as a program that `bat` will attempt to execute (e.g. less.exe).
- The user must run the bat program from that compromised directory.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was specific to Windows due to the way `Command::new` works.
- The fix implemented for this vulnerability involved using `grep_cli::resolve_binary` to ensure that executables were only resolved from the system's PATH or the explicit path given, not from the CWD.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `bat v0.18.2`.
- The fix was contributed from the `ripgrep` project via a reusable function within the `grep-cli` crate.
- Rust std lib is expected to have the fix in the future ([rust-lang/rust#87704](https://github.com/rust-lang/rust/pull/87704)) but may not be a complete fix because of compatibility reasons, suggesting third party resolvers may be preferred by applications.
