| I would like to report a vulnerability in `bat` but couldn't find proper contact information. I've checked the GitHub profile of [@sharkdp](https://github.com/sharkdp), [@eth-p](https://github.com/eth-p), and [@keith-hall](https://github.com/keith-hall), but nobody makes email public. Where can I report the vulnerability in `bat`? |

```
This fixes a bug on Windows where `Command::new` would also run
executables from the current working directory, possibly resulting in
accidental runs of programs called `less`.

This fixes a bug on Windows where `Command::new` would also run

executables from the current working directory, possibly resulting in

accidental runs of programs called `less`.

| I would however note that the std has to be cautious about (potentially) breaking compatibility with prior versions of Rust. This means that even if that PR gets merged, it will still do more than just search `PATH`. I would love to further simplify it in the future but in the meantime it may still be worth it for applications to use a third party resolver (such as `grep_cli`). |

[`589df67`](/sharkdp/bat/commit/589df6792fe406f91b00db5e24d35393c6527e6b)

## Features

* Ignore known backup/template filename suffixes when selecting the syntax, see [#1687](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1687) ([@scop](https://github.com/scop))

## Bugfixes

* Fix for a security vulnerability on Windows ([CVE-2021-36753](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36753)). Prior to this release, `bat` would execute programs called `less`/`less.exe` from the current working directory (instead of the one from `PATH`) with priority. An attacker might be able to use this by placing a malicious program in a shared directory where the user would execute `bat`. `bat` users on Windows are advised to upgrade to this version. See [#1724](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1724) and [#1472](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1472) ([@Ry0taK](https://github.com/Ry0taK)).

## Other

* Add bash completion, see [#1678](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1678) ([@scop](https://github.com/scop))
* Fix Clippy lints, see [#1661](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1661) ([@mohamed-abdelnour](https://github.com/mohamed-abdelnour))
* Add syntax highlighting test files, see [#1213](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1213) and [#1668](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1668) ([@mohamed-abdelnour](https://github.com/mohamed-abdelnour))

## Syntaxes

* Upgraded Julia syntax to fix a highlighting bug, see [#1692](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1692)
* Added support for `dash` syntax, see [#1654](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1654) ([@mohamed-abdelnour](https://github.com/mohamed-abdelnour))
* Added support for `XAML` syntax, see [#1590](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/issues/1590) and [#1655](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1655) ([@mohamed-abdelnour](https://github.com/mohamed-abdelnour))
* Apply `DotENV` syntax also for `.env.default` and `.env.defaults` files, see [#1669](https://github.com/sharkdp/bat/pull/1669)
