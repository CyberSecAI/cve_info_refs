The provided content describes two instances of a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the YMFE/yapi project. Both issues were reported on GitHub and provide similar descriptions for the vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization of user-provided input in the "remarks" field of the interface edit page. This allows malicious JavaScript code to be stored in the database. When the page is viewed, this stored malicious code is executed in the user's browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability: The application stores malicious user input without sanitization.
- Lack of input validation: The application does not validate or sanitize the "remarks" field, allowing any content, including malicious code, to be saved.
- Insecure handling of Markdown and HTML: The application renders the markdown with insufficient sanitization allowing HTML and Javascript injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser when they view the interface page, which could be used for:
  - Session hijacking: Stealing cookies to impersonate the user.
  - Data theft: Accessing sensitive information within the application.
  - Defacement: Modifying the content or behavior of the web page.
  - Phishing: Displaying fake login forms or other content to steal user credentials.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker inserts malicious JavaScript code into the "remarks" field of an interface.
- The code is saved into the database.
- When another user views the interface page containing the compromised remarks, the malicious code is executed in their browser.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a user with the ability to create or edit interfaces within the Yapi application.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the interface edit page and insert malicious payloads into the remarks field.
- The victim user would need to be added to the same project or group to be impacted by the stored XSS.
