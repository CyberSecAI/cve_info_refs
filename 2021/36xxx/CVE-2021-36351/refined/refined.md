Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is a SQL Injection vulnerability present in the Care2x Hospital Information Management System.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The specific vulnerability is a SQL injection in the `pday`, `pmonth`, and `pyear` parameters.
- These parameters are used in a GET request to the `nursing-station.php` page.
- The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for malicious SQL code to be injected.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access all tables and data within the database.
- This includes potentially sensitive patient information, administrative details, and other private data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `nursing-station.php` page.
- The attacker injects malicious SQL payloads into the vulnerable `pday`, `pmonth`, and `pyear` parameters within the query string.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Care2x server.
- No authentication is mentioned as a requirement.
- The attacker would need knowledge of SQL injection techniques and the database structure to fully exploit the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
- The application is outdated (last update in 2018) and no longer receiving updates, meaning the vulnerability will likely remain unfixed.
- The provided exploit examples show how the vulnerability can be leveraged using SQL injection payloads.
- The exploit-db entry confirms that the vulnerability is in version 2.7 and below.
