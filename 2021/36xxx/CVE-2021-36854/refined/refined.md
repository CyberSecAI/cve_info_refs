Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-36854

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Booking Ultra Pro Appointments Booking Calendar Plugin for WordPress, in versions <= 1.1.8, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF).

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **CSRF (Cross-Site Request Forgery):** The plugin lacks proper protection against CSRF attacks. This vulnerability allows an attacker to trick a logged-in user into performing unintended actions on the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force a higher privileged user (e.g., administrator) to execute unwanted actions under their current authentication, potentially leading to:
    - Unauthorized modifications to plugin settings
    - Creation or deletion of appointments or users
    - Other administrative actions that could compromise the website or its data.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would need to craft a malicious request that, when triggered by an authenticated user, would perform actions on the Booking Ultra Pro plugin.
- This could involve tricking a user into clicking a link or loading a webpage containing the malicious request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated on the targeted website to initiate the attack.
- The attacker requires the ability to lure a logged-in user to trigger the malicious request. This could be achieved through social engineering, malicious links, or by injecting the malicious code in a different application or website visited by the targeted user.

**Additional Details:**

-   The vulnerability is considered to have a low severity impact with a CVSS score of 5.4
-   The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.1.9 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is related to OWASP Top 10 A5: Broken Access Control.
