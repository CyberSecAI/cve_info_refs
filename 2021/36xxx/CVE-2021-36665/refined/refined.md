Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-36665:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** The `inSyncUpgrade` component uses `pickle.loads()` on untrusted data received from a user-controlled server. This allows an attacker to inject malicious code within the serialized data which will be executed upon deserialization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Deserialization:** As mentioned above, the use of `pickle.loads()` without proper sanitization.
*   **Command Injection:** The `inSyncUpgradeDaemon` executes a shell script, and this script is vulnerable to command injection via the filename of the installer package.
*   **URL Injection:** The Electron app is vulnerable to URL injection, which can be exploited to force a visit to an arbitrary URL.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:**  The local HTTP server does not sanitize input leading to command injection via the filename parameter.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An attacker with user-level privileges can gain root privileges by exploiting the insecure deserialization and command injection vulnerabilities.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** The insecure deserialization allows arbitrary code execution as root. The command injection also allows for code execution.
*   **Unauthorized Modification of Data:** Successful exploitation allows for data modification due to the privilege escalation.
*   **Arbitrary NodeJS code execution** via the URL injection vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker must have user-level access to the target machine.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle:**  An attacker can use a malicious server to deliver the exploit package.
*   **Malicious package:** The attacker serves a malicious package to the `inSyncUpgradeDaemon`.
*   **Malicious DYLIB**: The attacker injects a malicious dynamic library.
*   **Malicious URL**: The attacker injects a malicious URL.
*   **Malicious command**: The attacker uses a malicious filename.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User-Level Access:** The attacker needs to have local user-level access to the target macOS system.
*   **Ability to intercept or control network traffic:** Specifically, they must be able to redirect or provide a modified response to the `inSyncUpgrade`'s request for the package information
*  **Ability to write to the `inSync.cfg` file:** This allows the attacker to change the package download URL.
*   **Knowledge of the inSync system:** The attacker needs to understand how the `inSync` components interact and how the upgrade process works.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was present in Druva inSync versions prior to 7.0.0 (and 7.0.1 for some components).
*   The `inSyncUpgradeDaemon` runs as root, which makes it a prime target for privilege escalation.
*   The communication between the user-level binaries and the root daemons is authenticated using keys from the keychain. However, the user-level binary can be tricked into giving out the secret.
*   The `inSync` application is packaged using PyInstaller, making it necessary to decompile the binaries to analyze the code.
*   The Electron app uses an outdated version of Electron and lacks security mitigations like Context Isolation.
*   The `DYLD_INSERT_LIBRARIES` environment variable can be used to inject malicious libraries into the app due to the lack of hardened runtime protections on libraries.
*   The identified vulnerabilities were fixed in `inSync Client v7.0.1`.

This vulnerability is related to the insecure deserialization of data, which leads to code execution on the target system.
