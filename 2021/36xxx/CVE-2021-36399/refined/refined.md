Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of user ID numbers displayed in the quiz override screens.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the quiz override screens, which would then be executed when other users view those pages. This can lead to a variety of attacks, including stealing session cookies, redirecting users to malicious websites, or performing actions on behalf of the victim.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the user ID field in the quiz override screen, where a malicious user can inject JavaScript.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to be a user with the ability to input data that is displayed in the quiz override screens. This could include a user who has permission to set quiz overrides, or potentially even an ordinary user if the application allowed them to specify their own user ID.
