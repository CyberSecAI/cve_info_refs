- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The CODESYS web server allows specific requests to read files within the "visu" subfolder, which can contain private files with user IDs and password hashes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-552: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties. The vulnerability stems from insufficient access control on the web server, which allows for reading arbitrary files within a specific directory.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  An attacker could gain access to user IDs and password hashes, potentially leading to unauthorized access or further compromise of the system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via specific web server requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the affected CODESYS web server. No special access or authentication is required according to the advisory, just basic network connectivity to the web server.
