Actually I am new with pricing tables.I had tested a few others. This plugin made my experience hassle free and enjoyable. This plugin works perfectly, and it is easy to setup and use. Thanks

I installed it but did not know how to work with it. Got rid of it right away. Can´t spend much time figuring out what to do, it is not intuative.

DO NOT BUY IT! i bought my pro package 4 days ago, i paid $16. i had problem to log in. i sent them many emails , they never response. they ripped me off. i’m going to contact wordpress and report this shame to them as well.
the platform is useless and the support is awful. DO NOT EVEN DOWNLOAD IT! I tried other plugin from WEPEDEN.COM , They all have same issue, no support no contact information.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
