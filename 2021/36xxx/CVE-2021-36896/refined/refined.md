Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36896:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding within the "Pricing Table" WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the website.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to XSS attacks. This allows a malicious actor to inject client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Execution:** Attackers can inject malicious scripts (e.g., JavaScript, HTML) into the website.
- **Website Compromise:** This can lead to various impacts, including:
    - **Redirects to Malicious Sites:** Users could be redirected to phishing or malware-laden websites.
    - **Advertisement Injection:** Attackers might inject unauthorized ads.
    - **Data Theft:** Malicious scripts could steal cookies or sensitive information.
    - **Website Defacement:** Attackers can change the appearance of the website.
    - **Account Hijacking:** Attackers could potentially capture user credentials through injected forms or scripts.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Input Injection:** The primary attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through user-supplied input that is not sanitized or escaped by the plugin. While specific vulnerable entry points are not detailed, any plugin functionality that processes and outputs user-supplied data could be an attack surface.
- **Browser-Side Exploitation:** When a user visits a page containing the injected malicious script, the browser will execute the script, enabling the attacker's payload to function.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to inject their malicious script into the plugin's output. This likely involves exploiting a vulnerability in how the plugin handles user data or configuration settings. The specific method will depend on the precise nature of the vulnerable code within the plugin, which is not clear from this information.
- The attacker doesn't need to be a logged-in user or have admin access. The vulnerability can be triggered by visiting the affected page on the website, affecting all visitors.
- An attacker needs knowledge of XSS and have to craft a malicious script.

**Additional Notes:**
- The plugin was closed due to a security issue, which confirms the vulnerability's significance.
- The vulnerability has a "Low" severity rating, suggesting the impact may not be catastrophic. However, the potential impact depends on the nature of the injected script, which can be very dangerous.
- No fix for the vulnerability is available at this time, making it essential to remove the plugin.
- The affected versions are <= 1.5.2
- The CVE was assigned on April 5, 2022 and published by Patchstack on April 7, 2022
