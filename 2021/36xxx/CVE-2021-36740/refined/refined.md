{
  "CVE-2021-36740": {
    "description": "Varnish is vulnerable to request smuggling attacks if the HTTP/2 protocol is enabled. The smuggled requests do not go through normal VCL processing, and any authorization steps implemented in VCL would be bypassed.",
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from improper handling of content length when processing HTTP/2 data frames.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Request smuggling",
      "Improper input validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can bypass authorization implemented in VCL, potentially leading to information disclosure and cache poisoning. The responses to the smuggled requests can, under certain circumstances, be obtained by the attacker. The attacker might also be able to insert the response to a smuggled request as cached content.",
    "attack_vectors": "By sending crafted HTTP/2 requests, an attacker can smuggle requests that bypass Varnish's VCL processing.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP/2 requests to a vulnerable Varnish server with HTTP/2 enabled."
