- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `set_sys_init` function in `login.cgi`, responsible for setting the admin password during initial setup, remains accessible to unauthenticated users after the setup is complete.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Unauthenticated password reset vulnerability. The `set_sys_init` function uses the value of the `newpass` parameter to update the admin password.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can change the administrator password, gaining full control of the router's configuration.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is accessible via HTTP POST request to `login.cgi` with the `page` parameter set to `sysinit` and a `newpass` parameter containing the new password. No authentication is required to make this request.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker can be unauthenticated and needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the router's web interface.
