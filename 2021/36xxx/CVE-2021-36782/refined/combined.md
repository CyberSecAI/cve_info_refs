# Plaintext storage and exposure of credentials in Rancher API and cluster.management.cattle.io object

Critical

[rmweir](/rmweir)
published
GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f
Aug 19, 2022

## Package

gomod

rancher/rancher
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

From 2.5.0 and 2.6.0 up to and including 2.5.15 and 2.6.6

## Patched versions

2.5.16, 2.6.7 and later releases

## Description

### Impact

An issue was discovered in Rancher versions up to and including 2.5.15 and 2.6.6 where sensitive fields, like passwords, API keys and Rancher's service account token (used to provision clusters), were stored in plaintext directly on Kubernetes objects like `Clusters`, for example `cluster.management.cattle.io`. Anyone with read access to those objects in the Kubernetes API could retrieve the plaintext version of those sensitive data.

The exposed credentials are visible in Rancher to authenticated `Cluster Owners`, `Cluster Members`, `Project Owners`, `Project Members` and `User Base` on the endpoints:

* `/v1/management.cattle.io.catalogs`
* `/v1/management.cattle.io.cluster`
* `/v1/management.cattle.io.clustertemplates`
* `/v1/management.cattle.io.notifiers`
* `/v1/project.cattle.io.sourcecodeproviderconfig`
* `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/catalogs`
* `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/clusters`
* `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/clustertemplates`
* `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/notifiers`
* `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/project.cattle.io/v3/sourcecodeproviderconfigs`

Sensitive fields are now stripped from `Clusters` and other objects and moved to a `Secret` before the object is stored. The `Secret` is retrieved when the credential is needed. For objects that existed before this security fix, a one-time migration happens on startup.

**Important:**

* The exposure of Rancher's `serviceAccountToken` allows any standard user to escalate its privileges to cluster administrator in Rancher.
* For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher, the final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions that the leaked credentials have on their own services.

The fields that have been addressed by this security fix are:

* `Notifier.SMTPConfig.Password`
* `Notifier.WechatConfig.Secret`
* `Notifier.DingtalkConfig.Secret`
* `Catalog.Spec.Password`
* `SourceCodeProviderConfig.GithubPipelineConfig.ClientSecret`
* `SourceCodeProviderConfig.GitlabPipelineConfig.ClientSecret`
* `SourceCodeProviderConfig.BitbucketCloudPipelineConfig.ClientSecret`
* `SourceCodeProviderConfig.BitbucketServerPipelineConfig.PrivateKey`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.BackupConfig.S3BackupConfig.SecretKey`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries.Password`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.WeaveNetworkProvider.Password`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.Global.Password`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.VirtualCenter.Password`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.OpenstackCloudProvider.Global.Password`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientSecret`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientCertPassword`
* `Cluster.Status.ServiceAccountToken`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries.Password`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.WeaveNetworkProvider.Password`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.Global.Password`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.VirtualCenter.Password`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.OpenstackCloudProvider.Global.Password`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientSecret`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientCertPassword`

### Patches

Patched versions include releases 2.5.16, 2.6.7 and later versions.

After upgrading to a patched version, it is important to check for the `SecretsMigrated` condition on `Clusters`, `ClusterTemplates`, and `Catalogs` to confirm when secrets have been fully migrated off of those objects and the objects scoped within them (`Notifiers` and `SourceCodeProviderConfigs`).

### Workarounds

Limit access in Rancher to trusted users. There is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions.

**Important:**

* It is highly advised to rotate Rancher's `serviceAccountToken`. This rotation is not done by the version upgrade. Please see the helper script below.
* The local and downstream clusters should be checked for potential unrecognized services (pods), users and API keys.
* It is recommended to review for potential leaked credentials in this scenario, that are not directly related to Rancher, and to change them if deemed necessary.

The script available in [rancherlabs/support-tools/rotate-tokens](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/blob/master/rotate-tokens) repository can be used as a helper to rotate the service account token (used to provision clusters). The script requires a valid Rancher API token, `kubectl` access to the `local` cluster and the `jq` command.

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

## Package

gomod

github.com/rancher/rancher
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 2.5.0, < 2.5.16
>= 2.6.0, < 2.6.7

## Patched versions

2.5.16
2.6.7

## Description

### Impact

An issue was discovered in Rancher versions up to and including 2.5.15 and 2.6.6 where sensitive fields, like passwords, API keys and Rancher's service account token (used to provision clusters), were stored in plaintext directly on Kubernetes objects like `Clusters`, for example `cluster.management.cattle.io`. Anyone with read access to those objects in the Kubernetes API could retrieve the plaintext version of those sensitive data.

The exposed credentials are visible in Rancher to authenticated `Cluster Owners`, `Cluster Members`, `Project Owners`, `Project Members` and `User Base` on the endpoints:

* `/v1/management.cattle.io.catalogs`
* `/v1/management.cattle.io.cluster`
* `/v1/management.cattle.io.clustertemplates`
* `/v1/management.cattle.io.notifiers`
* `/v1/project.cattle.io.sourcecodeproviderconfig`
* `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/catalogs`
* `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/clusters`
* `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/clustertemplates`
* `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/notifiers`
* `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/project.cattle.io/v3/sourcecodeproviderconfigs`

Sensitive fields are now stripped from `Clusters` and other objects and moved to a `Secret` before the object is stored. The `Secret` is retrieved when the credential is needed. For objects that existed before this security fix, a one-time migration happens on startup.

**Important:**

* The exposure of Rancher's `serviceAccountToken` allows any standard user to escalate its privileges to cluster administrator in Rancher.
* For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher, the final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions that the leaked credentials have on their own services.

The fields that have been addressed by this security fix are:

* `Notifier.SMTPConfig.Password`
* `Notifier.WechatConfig.Secret`
* `Notifier.DingtalkConfig.Secret`
* `Catalog.Spec.Password`
* `SourceCodeProviderConfig.GithubPipelineConfig.ClientSecret`
* `SourceCodeProviderConfig.GitlabPipelineConfig.ClientSecret`
* `SourceCodeProviderConfig.BitbucketCloudPipelineConfig.ClientSecret`
* `SourceCodeProviderConfig.BitbucketServerPipelineConfig.PrivateKey`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.BackupConfig.S3BackupConfig.SecretKey`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries.Password`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.WeaveNetworkProvider.Password`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.Global.Password`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.VirtualCenter.Password`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.OpenstackCloudProvider.Global.Password`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientSecret`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientCertPassword`
* `Cluster.Status.ServiceAccountToken`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries.Password`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.WeaveNetworkProvider.Password`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.Global.Password`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.VsphereCloudProvider.VirtualCenter.Password`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.OpenstackCloudProvider.Global.Password`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientSecret`
* `ClusterTemplate.Spec.ClusterConfig.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.CloudProvider.AzureCloudProvider.AADClientCertPassword`

### Patches

Patched versions include releases 2.5.16, 2.6.7 and later versions.

After upgrading to a patched version, it is important to check for the `SecretsMigrated` condition on `Clusters`, `ClusterTemplates`, and `Catalogs` to confirm when secrets have been fully migrated off of those objects and the objects scoped within them (`Notifiers` and `SourceCodeProviderConfigs`).

### Workarounds

Limit access in Rancher to trusted users. There is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions.

**Important:**

* It is highly advised to rotate Rancher's `serviceAccountToken`. This rotation is not done by the version upgrade. Please see the helper script below.
* The local and downstream clusters should be checked for potential unrecognized services (pods), users and API keys.
* It is recommended to review for potential leaked credentials in this scenario, that are not directly related to Rancher, and to change them if deemed necessary.

The script available in [rancherlabs/support-tools/rotate-tokens](https://github.com/rancherlabs/support-tools/blob/master/rotate-tokens) repository can be used as a helper to rotate the service account token (used to provision clusters). The script requires a valid Rancher API token, `kubectl` access to the `local` cluster and the `jq` command.

([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

>= 2.5.0, < 2.5.17
>= 2.6.0, < 2.6.10
>= 2.7.0, < 2.7.1

## Patched versions

2.5.17

## Description

### Impact

This issue affects Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.16, from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.9 and 2.7.0. It was discovered that the security advisory [CVE-2021-36782](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f "CVE-2021-36782") ([GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f "GHSA-g7j7-h4q8-8w2f")), previously released by Rancher, missed addressing some sensitive fields, secret tokens, encryption keys, and SSH keys that were still being stored in plaintext directly on Kubernetes objects like `Clusters`.

The exposed credentials are visible in Rancher to authenticated `Cluster Owners`, `Cluster Members`, `Project Owners` and `Project Members` of that cluster on the endpoints:

* `/v1/management.cattle.io.cluster`
* `/v1/management.cattle.io.clustertemplaterevisions`

The remaining sensitive fields are now stripped from `Clusters` and other objects and moved to a `Secret` before the object is stored. The `Secret` is retrieved when the credential is needed. For objects that existed before this security fix, a one-time migration happens on startup.

The fields that have been addressed by this security fix are:

* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].AESGCM.Keys[].Secret`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].AESCBC.Keys[].Secret`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.KubeAPI.SecretsEncryptionConfig.CustomConfig.Providers[].SecretboxConfiguration.Keys[].Secret`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Services.Kubelet.ExtraEnv` when containing the `AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY` environment variable
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.BastionHost.SSHKey`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSecretAccessKey`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.PrivateRegistries[].ECRCredentialPlugin.AwsSessionToken`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.ApicUserKey`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.KafkaClientKey`
* `Cluster.Spec.RancherKubernetesEngineConfig.Network.AciNetworkProvider.Token`

**Important:**

* For the exposure of credentials not related to Rancher, the final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions the leaked credentials have on their services.
* It is recommended to review for potentially leaked credentials in this scenario and to change them if deemed necessary.

### Workarounds

There is no direct mitigation besides updating Rancher to a patched version.

### Patches

Patched versions include releases 2.5.17, 2.6.10, 2.7.1 and later versions.

After upgrading to a patched version, it is important to check for the `ACISecretsMigrated` and `RKESecretsMigrated` conditions on `Clusters` and `ClusterTemplateRevisions` to confirm when secrets have been fully migrated off of those objects, and the objects scoped within them.
