The provided content is related to CVE-2021-36756.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the *Federated Reporting* feature of CFEngine Enterprise, where the TLS certificates of *feeder* hubs are not properly checked when connecting to the *superhub*.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper TLS certificate validation in the *superhub*-*feeder* connection process.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can perform IP or DNS spoofing to redirect traffic from the *superhub* to their machine instead of the legitimate *feeder* hub.
- This allows the attacker to connect a malicious *feeder* to the *superhub*.
- The attacker can then send fake or harmful data to the *superhub*, potentially damaging the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network-based attacks such as IP spoofing or DNS spoofing.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network access to the *superhub*.
- Ability to perform IP spoofing, DNS spoofing, or similar techniques to intercept and redirect network traffic.

**Additional Information**
- *Feeder* hubs and their data are not affected by this vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is mitigated in CFEngine Enterprise versions *3.15.4-2* and *3.18.0-2*.
- Mitigation requires re-installation of all *superhubs* and re-connection of all *feeder* hubs after upgrading.
- The new releases ensure that the TLS certificates of feeder hubs are verified, either automatically or manually by the administrator.
