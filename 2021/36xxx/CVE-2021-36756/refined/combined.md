The CFEngine engineering team has recently discovered two security issues in the *CFEngine Enterprise* product:

* CVE-2021-38379 - Publicly available exported reports
* CVE-2021-36756 - Certificate not checked in Federated Reporting

While the latter one (`CVE-2021-36756`) only affects *CFEngine Enterprise* deployments using the *Federated Reporting* functionality, the former one (`CVE-2021-38379`) affects all deployments running all supported versions of *CFEngine Enterprise* (and many unsupported versions, 3.5 or newer, to be more precise).
Both issues were discovered internally during development and testing and we have no indications of these vulnerabilities being exploited or known of outside of the development team.

## CVE-2021-38379 - Publicly available exported reports

### Description

*CFEngine Enterprise* uses the `tmp` directory in the HTML document root (for example <https://hub.example.com/tmp/>) for temporary files that need to be accessed by users of *Mission Portal*, the *CFEngine Enterprise* web user interface.
This directory needs to be publicly accessible because it includes files that are needed for the basic functionality.
Unfortunately, this directory has also been used for files with exported reports, for example <https://hub.example.com/tmp/CFEngine_Enterprise_advancedreports-09-15-2021-abcdef.pdf>.
An attacker can try making requests to the hub machine with the URLs in the above easily predictable format and get access to reports generated by users using *Mission Portal*.

### Detection

All deployments running *CFEngine Enterprise* version 3.5 and newer are affected.

### Impact

An attacker with network access to the hub machine (port `443`) can obtain reports generated by users in *Mission Portal* with potentially sensitive data.

### Mitigation

Because the mechanisms for making the exported reports available for users are part of the *CFEngine Enterprise* binaries, the only possible mitigation for this CVE is to upgrade the hub installations to one of the newest supported releases of *CFEngine Enterprise* - version *3.15.4-2* or *3.18.0-2*.
**Client machines are not affected by this CVE as they don't run the *Mission Portal* web user interface.**

The newest supported releases of *CFEngine Enterprise* use a separate directory for exported reports which is not publicly accessible and the names of the files with the exported reports are practically impossible to predict so even logged in users cannot get access to other users' exported reports.

This issue has been registered as *CVE-2021-38379* in [the official public CVE registry](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38379).

## CVE-2021-36756 - Certificate not checked in Federated Reporting

### Description

*CFEngine Enterprise* deployments using the *Federated Reporting* feature to collect reports from multiple hubs (called *feeders*) to one aggregating hub (called *superhub*) don't properly check the TLS certificates of *feeder* hubs when connecting them to the *superhub*.
An attacker can use IP spoofing, DNS spoofing or other common techniques to direct the traffic from the *superhub* to their own machine instead of the real *feeder* hub and get it connected to the *superhub*.
The *superhub*-*feeder* connection process exchanges secrets that are then used to ensure integrity and authenticity of the data sent by the *feeder*.
So the attacker can feed the *superhub* fake data or, even worse, harmful data that can damage the *superhub* database.
**Feeder hubs and their data are not affected by this vulnerability.**

### Detection

All *CFEngine Enterprise* deployments using the *Federated Reporting* feature are affected by this vulnerability.

### Mitigation

The only possible mitigation of this vulnerability is re-installation of all *superhubs* and re-connection of all the *feeder* hubs.
The newest supported releases of *CFEngine Enterprise* - version *3.15.4-2* and *3.18.0-2* - ensure that the TLS certificates of *feeder* hubs are verified, either automatically if they are using standard certificates with certificate chains signed by trusted certification authorities, or manually by the admin user if they use self-signed certificates.
Fortunately, the *superhubs* usually don't serve policy (except to themselves) and the only exclusive data they have is their own reporting data and its history.
The configuration, saved queries, dashboards etc.
can be preserved using the [Import & Export API](https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/3.18/reference-enterprise-api-ref-export-import-api.html).

To re-install all *superhubs* and re-connect all *feeder* hubs, please follow the [instructions for a superhub upgrade](https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/3.18/enterprise-cfengine-guide-federated-reporting.html#superhub-upgrade) provided as part of the [online *CFEngine Enterprise* documentation](https://docs.cfengine.com/docs/3.18/enterprise-cfengine-guide.html).
Please notice that all the *feeder* hubs need to be disabled (reverted to normal hubs) before they can be re-connected to *superhubs*.

This issue has been registered as *CVE-2021-36756* in [the official public CVE registry](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36756).

## Packages for the newest releases of CFEngine Enterprise

The previously released 3.18.0 and 3.15.4 hub packages are affected by these vulnerabilities and have been replaced by new packages.
Only the vulnerabilities were fixed in these re-releases.
The new packages have a `-2` in the filename and new checksums.
They are now available in the [Downloads section of the website](/downloads/cfengine-enterprise/), [cf-remote](https://pypi.org/project/cf-remote/), etc.
For completeness, the links to the new packages and their checksums are provided below:
