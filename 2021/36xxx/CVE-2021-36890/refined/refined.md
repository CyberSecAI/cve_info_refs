Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36890:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the WordPress Social Share Buttons by Supsystic plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **CSRF Vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF). This means that a malicious actor can potentially force an authenticated user to perform unintended actions on the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher privileged users to execute unwanted actions, which could include modifying plugin settings or other administrative functions.
- The specific impact of the vulnerability will vary depending on the actions that can be triggered using a CSRF attack.

**Attack Vectors:**
- A malicious actor could craft a link or HTML content that, when clicked by an authenticated user, would send a forged request to the vulnerable plugin.
- The user would need to be logged into WordPress while they click the malicious content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker doesn't need to be authenticated to the WordPress site.
- The attacker needs the ability to get an authenticated user to click on the crafted malicious link/content, e.g., through a social engineering attack such as sending a malicious link to the victim through email.
- The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerable plugin's functionality and how to construct a malicious request.
