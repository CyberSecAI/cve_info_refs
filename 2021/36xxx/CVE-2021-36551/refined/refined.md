The provided content describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the "Calendar" feature of TikiWiki version 21.4.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input when adding a calendar event description. Specifically, the application allows the use of the `javascript:` protocol within the `href` attribute of an `<a>` tag in the event description.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored XSS vulnerability: Malicious JavaScript code can be injected into the event description and stored in the application's database, leading to persistent execution each time the event is viewed.
- Improper input sanitization: The application fails to neutralize or sanitize user input that could contain malicious code, particularly in the event description field.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser when the calendar event is viewed.
- This allows the attacker to potentially steal cookies and session information, redirect the user to malicious websites, or perform actions on the user's behalf within the web application.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the "Description" field when adding or editing a calendar event.
- An attacker can inject malicious code, specifically a javascript payload within an <a> tag's href attribute when creating a new event.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account on the vulnerable TikiWiki instance.
- The attacker requires the ability to add or edit calendar events.
