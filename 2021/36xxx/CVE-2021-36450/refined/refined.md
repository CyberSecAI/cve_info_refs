Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36450:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input in the `NEWUINAV` parameter of the `my_notifications` page, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability
- Lack of input sanitization

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the victim's browser.
- This can lead to various malicious actions such as stealing session cookies, redirecting users to phishing sites, performing actions on behalf of the user, etc.
- The provided example demonstrates the retrieval of `document.cookie`, which could be used to steal session information.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the malicious JavaScript code within the `NEWUINAV` parameter.
- The attacker can trick a user into clicking the link, for example, by sending it via email or chat, or hosting the link on a website.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to create a crafted URL with the malicious payload in the `NEWUINAV` parameter.
- The attacker does not need prior access to the application; they can exploit this vulnerability by sending the crafted URL to unsuspecting users.
- The user must be logged into the vulnerable application or must log in after being redirected.
