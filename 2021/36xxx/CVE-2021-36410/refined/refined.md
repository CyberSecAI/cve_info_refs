Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-36410:

**Root Cause:**

- A stack buffer overflow occurs within the `put_epel_hv_fallback` function in `fallback-motion.cc`. This function is used during the decoding process of the H.265 video codec.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The primary weakness is a stack-based buffer overflow. This happens when writing data beyond the allocated space on the stack.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability leads to a program crash due to the stack buffer overflow. This effectively causes a denial of service.
- **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** While not explicitly stated, stack buffer overflows can potentially be exploited to achieve arbitrary code execution. This is a common risk associated with such vulnerabilities, where an attacker might overwrite parts of the stack to control program flow.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Crafted HEVC/H.265 File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted HEVC/H.265 video file. The crafted file triggers the vulnerable code path during decoding.
- **`dec265` Application:** The vulnerability is triggered when the `dec265` application (a decoder program for H.265) attempts to decode the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Ability to Provide a Malicious File:** An attacker needs to be able to provide the vulnerable application with a crafted HEVC/H.265 file. This could be done by tricking a user into opening the file, or by providing the file through some other channel.
- **No Specific Position Required:** The vulnerability can be exploited by any attacker who can provide a malicious input to the vulnerable decoder.

**Technical Details:**

- The overflow occurs within the `put_epel_hv_fallback` function, which is used for motion compensation.
- The specific overflow is a `READ` operation with size 2 at a specific memory address on the stack that overruns a buffer named 'padbuf'.
- The provided AddressSanitizer output shows the exact function call stack leading to the vulnerability.

**Additional Notes**

- The issue was reported by a user named "dhbbb" who provided a Proof of Concept (PoC) file which is included in the provided data.
- The fix was committed by "farindk" and referenced the issue directly.
