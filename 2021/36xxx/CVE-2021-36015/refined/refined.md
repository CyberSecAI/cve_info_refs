- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software accesses a memory location after the end of a buffer, leading to potential memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: Local attack, where an attacker would need to have local access to the system. User interaction is required for exploitation.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to get the user to open a specially crafted file, thus requiring user interaction.
