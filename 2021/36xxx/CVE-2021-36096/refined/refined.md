The provided content is related to CVE-2021-36096.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises because the generated Support Bundles in OTRS include private S/MIME and PGP keys if the containing folder is not hidden. Also, secrets and PINs for these keys are not properly masked.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Inclusion of private keys (S/MIME and PGP) in support bundles.
- Exposure of secrets and PINs associated with the keys due to improper masking.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive private keys, allowing them to:
- Decrypt encrypted communications.
- Impersonate users or services by using exposed PGP keys for signing.
- Gain unauthorized access to systems or data protected by the compromised keys.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker who gains access to a generated support bundle.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to obtain a support bundle generated by an affected OTRS system. This could potentially be done through social engineering, network access or by compromising the system where the support bundle is stored.
- The user generating the support bundle must have access to the S/MIME or PGP keys and they must not be stored in a hidden folder.

**Affected product versions:**
- OTRS 8.0.x versions 8.0.15 and prior
- OTRS 7.0.x versions 7.0.28 and prior
- ((OTRS)) Community Edition 6.0.x version 6.0.1 and later versions.

**Fixed in:**
- OTRS 8.0.16
- OTRS 7.0.29
