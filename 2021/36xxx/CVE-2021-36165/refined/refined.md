- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The RICON Industrial Cellular Router sends username and password credentials using base64 encoding instead of proper encryption.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cleartext transmission of credentials due to the use of base64 encoding, which is easily reversible.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can easily obtain user credentials, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the router's management interface and network.
- **Attack vectors:** Network traffic interception (e.g., via man-in-the-middle attack) where the attacker can capture and decode the base64-encoded credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic between the user and the router.
