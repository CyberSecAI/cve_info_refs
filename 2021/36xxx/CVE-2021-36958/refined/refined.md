  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the fact that while Windows enforces digital signatures on printer driver packages, it does not enforce similar signature requirements for queue-specific files that can be specified by printer drivers. These queue-specific files can include arbitrary libraries that will be loaded by the privileged Windows Print Spooler service. This allows an attacker to overwrite legitimate files with malicious ones and achieve local privilege escalation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Lack of signature enforcement for queue-specific files.",
      "Ability to overwrite driver files through queue-specific files.",
      "Loading of arbitrary libraries by the privileged Windows Print Spooler service."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code with SYSTEM privileges on a vulnerable system, leading to Local Privilege Escalation (LPE).",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Connecting to a malicious printer.",
      "Exploiting the Point and Print functionality."
    ],
    "required_capabilities": [
      "Ability to host a malicious shared printer.",
       "Ability to make a user connect to the malicious printer using Point and Print functionality."
    ],
     "additional_details": "The vulnerability can be exploited by configuring a malicious printer to specify arbitrary files using the `CopyFiles` directive, which are then copied to the victim system without signature verification. These files can be used to overwrite signed files and execute code within the context of the Print Spooler service. A publicly available exploit exists for this vulnerability."
