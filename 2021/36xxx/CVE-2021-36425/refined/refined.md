  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The `unlink` method in `include/inc_act/act_ftptakeover.php` at line 334 does not filter the `$file` variable, allowing directory traversal using `../` to delete arbitrary files.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper Input Validation",
      "Path Traversal"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file deletion on the server.",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the file parameter in the POST request when taking over selected files via the web interface.",
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be logged into the backend with editor privileges and be able to upload files. They need to capture the POST request using a proxy, modify the file path and base64 encode it."
