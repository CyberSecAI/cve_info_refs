- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by the unlimited size of images to be parsed, leading to low memory errors.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Low memory error due to improper handling of image sizes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can cause the Gallery or Files app to exit unexpectedly.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation involves parsing images with excessive size.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to provide the overly large image. The user must then open the image via the vulnerable app (Gallery or Files).
