- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The MIK.starlight server exposes a function `AdminGetFirstFileContentByFilePath` through a WCF endpoint that allows reading arbitrary files from the file system.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
  - **CWE-552**: Files or Directories Accessible to External Parties.
  - The function `AdminGetFirstFileContentByFilePath` does not properly restrict access to files.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can read arbitrary files from the file system of the server. This could lead to information disclosure, potentially exposing sensitive data such as configuration files, credentials, or user data.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the web server's WCF endpoint.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
  - The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server.
  - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user due to another vulnerability (SYSS-2021-036, not described here but referenced), which allows any authenticated user to call the vulnerable function.

The provided content offers more detail than the basic CVE description by including a proof of concept, showing how to trigger the vulnerability using a crafted SOAP request, and providing the expected server response. It also clarifies that the vulnerability is accessible to any authenticated user because of a separate vulnerability.
