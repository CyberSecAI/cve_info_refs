- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A local privilege escalation vulnerability exists in the end-of-life Sophos SSL VPN client for Windows. It allows a local attacker to overwrite arbitrary files using VPN client logs with administrator privileges.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Local privilege escalation leading to arbitrary file overwrite.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  A successful attack can result in a denial of service and data loss.
- **Attack vectors:** Local attacker with the ability to execute code on the target system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have local access to the machine with the Sophos SSL VPN client installed.
