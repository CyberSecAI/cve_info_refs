Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-36100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A specially crafted string within the OTRS system configuration can allow the execution of arbitrary system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper input validation: The system does not properly sanitize or validate strings used in system configurations, allowing for the injection of system commands.
- Remote Code Execution: The vulnerability allows the attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting OTRS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Complete system compromise: An attacker can gain full control of the system by executing arbitrary commands, potentially leading to data breaches, malware installation, or denial of service.
- Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability: The vulnerability has a high impact on all three of these security principles.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the network, as it involves injecting a malicious string into the system configuration.
- Configuration Injection: The attack vector is focused on injecting malicious code through the system configuration parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authenticated access: The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log into the OTRS system to modify system configurations.
- High privileges:  The attacker needs to have permissions to modify OTRS system configuration parameters.

**Additional Details (from the Debian LTS advisory):**

- The fix involves:
    - Removing configurable system commands from generic agents.
    - Removing the `MIME-Viewer###...` settings. The system command in `SysConfig` option `MIME-Viewer` is now only configurable via `Kernel/Config.pm`.
    - Removing dashboard widget support for executing system commands.
    - Deactivating support for execution of configurable system commands from Sendmail and PostMaster pre-filter configurations.

- This vulnerability is also known as `OSA-2022-03` or `ZSA-2022-02`.
