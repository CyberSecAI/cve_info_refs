The provided content contains information about a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the `engineercms` project, specifically related to the "Nickname" field on the user list page. This aligns with the general nature of CVE-2021-36605 which is a placeholder for CVE descriptions.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not properly sanitize user input in the "nickname" field before storing it in the database. Specifically, it lacks proper HTML escaping before rendering it to the user.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
*   **Impact of exploitation**: When a user views the user list page, the malicious JavaScript code embedded in the nickname field is executed in the user's browser. This could lead to various impacts such as:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Stealing of cookies
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Other client-side attacks
*   **Attack vectors**:
    *   The attacker exploits the user input field "Nickname" when updating user profiles by injecting malicious Javascript payload.
    *   The payload is then stored in the database.
    *   When a user visits the user list page, the stored payload gets executed in their browser.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position**:
    *   The attacker must have an account with the ability to modify the "Nickname" field on their profile page.
    *   They must have knowledge of the vulnerable input field to inject the payload.
