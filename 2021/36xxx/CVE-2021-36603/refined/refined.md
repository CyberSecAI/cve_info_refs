Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization in the "Friendly Name 1" field within the Tasmota web interface. User-provided input is not sanitized before being rendered on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability. By injecting malicious JavaScript code into the "Friendly Name 1" field, an attacker can execute arbitrary code within the context of the user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious actions including:
    - Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    - Redirecting the user to malicious websites.
    - Modifying the content of the web page.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
- **Device Compromise:** While the direct impact is on the user's browser, it can indirectly lead to device compromise if an attacker is able to manipulate device settings through the interface or by redirecting to malicious pages with other exploits.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack vector is the Tasmota web interface itself, specifically the "Configure Other" section where the "Friendly Name 1" setting can be modified.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Tasmota Web Interface:** The attacker needs to be able to access the Tasmota web interface, either through local network access or, in a less secure scenario, through public internet exposure.
- **Basic Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of XSS to inject malicious javascript into the field.

**Additional Notes:**
- The developers initially marked this as "as designed" and "won't fix" due to the limitations of the ESP8266 platform and the simplicity of the webserver code, but it was later fixed in version 13.3.0.1.
- The discussion highlights that ESP8266 devices are inherently insecure if exposed to unauthorized networks and users. It is advised not to use Tasmota devices in unsecured environments.
- The initial report used  `"/><script>alert(1)</script>` as an example but `/><script>alert(1)</script>` without the initial `"` also triggers the vulnerability.
