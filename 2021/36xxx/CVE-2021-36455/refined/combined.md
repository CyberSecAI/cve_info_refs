The **Navigate CMS** team has just released a software update which includes a collection of security fixes, bugs resolved and library upgrades.

\* themes: ignore window.postmessage event when the sent message is empty
\* nvweb properties: properly load product properties by template
+ nvlist\_conditional by="product" stock="true|false|{number}|{min-max}"
+ nvweb conditional by="product" stock="true|false|{number}|{min-max}"
\* use query parameters when making a quick search in lists (prevents SQL injection attacks)
\* layout.class: purify url request parameter "fid"
\* purify "navigate-quicksearch" url request parameter to prevent reflected XSS attacks
- session: remove deprecated code supporting PHP versions before 7.3
\* always use https url in application, if available
+ database.class: added function "first\_value"
\* media browser: improve search interface
\* minor changes to improve code readability
+ files, properties: allow giving direct URL for videos (supporting MP4 and WEBM)
+ website cron: allow specifing frequency for a recurring task

\* naviforms.class: slightly modify tinymce load configuration and workaround for internal CSS file urls
\* webusers: show email column in list
\* items: additional checks to prevent Flot errors
+ nvweb list: categories attribute now allows passing the name of a property
+ nvweb list: requesting webuser "fullname" allows looking for the username
+ nvweb list: allow special list sources from themes and extensions
+ comments.class: added function "author\_fullname" which looks for the full name of the user if he's the author of the comment
+ nvweb: nv conditionals can now be delayed like nv lists
- remove pixlr integration
+ nvweb list conditional: added "not" attribute to help negate any conditional
\* interface: improve control in navigate cms actions menu
\* orders: mute PHP errors when generating a PDF
\* REF r(): custom script version for navigate cms

### **[hydrasky-team](/hydrasky-team)** commented [Jun 26, 2021](#issue-930656566)

| **EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR** An authenticated malicious user can take advantage of a SQL injection UNION attack vulnerability with quicksearch parameter in URL.  **IMPACT** A successful SQL injection attack may result in the unauthorized viewing of user lists, the deletion of entire tables and, in certain cases, the attacker gaining administrative rights to a database, all of which are highly detrimental to a business.  **VULNERABILITY CODE** I found quicksearch parameter is not handled in SQL query with WHERE clause in **\lib\packages\comments\comments.php**  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64893387/123508620-b41c6700-d69a-11eb-9381-16fadd89ed5e.png)  And the **protect** function in **\lib\core\core.php** is not use ESCAPE to filter special characters  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64893387/123508644-d0200880-d69a-11eb-855c-74f54b81f451.png)  Then it is use to query in: **\lib\core\database.class.php**  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64893387/123508657-e3cb6f00-d69a-11eb-8aa0-3d46838b9a68.png)  **STEPS TO REPRODUCE**   1. We change the request in URL   `GET /navigate/navigate/navigate.php?fid=comments&act=json&_search=true&quicksearch=%25")+UNION+ALL+SELECT+DATABASE(),null,null,null,null,null,null,VERSION()%3b--&_search=false&nd=1623493056682&rows=30&page=1&sidx=date_created&sord=desc&filters=`   2. And then we could exploit all the data.   [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64893387/123508687-14aba400-d69b-11eb-942a-c21e74713404.png) |
