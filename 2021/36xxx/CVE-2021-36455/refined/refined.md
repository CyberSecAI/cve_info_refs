Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `quicksearch` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized before being used in an SQL query.
- The `protect` function used for filtering special characters does not use `ESCAPE` which would prevent SQL injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability exists due to the lack of proper sanitization of the `quicksearch` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Unauthorized viewing of user lists.
- Deletion of entire database tables.
- Potential to gain administrative rights to the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious user can craft a URL with a specially crafted `quicksearch` parameter containing SQL injection payloads.
- The specific example uses a `UNION ALL SELECT` statement to extract database information.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated.
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests with the crafted `quicksearch` parameter.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was located in the `comments.php` file.
- The vulnerable code was in `\lib\packages\comments\comments.php`, and the `protect` function in `\lib\core\core.php`, and then used in `\lib\core\database.class.php`
- The issue was reported by security researcher **Duong Xuan Hiep - VNCERT/CC - Hydrasky** and fixed by the Navigate CMS team.
- The fix was implemented with commit `b2937f5`
- The provided example demonstrates how an attacker could use this vulnerability to extract database information by injecting a `UNION ALL SELECT` SQL statement through the `quicksearch` parameter.
- The vulnerability was identified in Navigate CMS version 2.9
