Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36582:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient file upload restrictions in Kooboo CMS 2.1.1.0, which allows an attacker to upload arbitrary files including executable server-side scripts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload: The system does not properly validate the type of uploaded files, allowing malicious files such as ASPX web shells to be uploaded.
- Lack of proper input sanitization: The system does not prevent the upload of executable files.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By uploading and executing a malicious web shell, an attacker can gain full control over the vulnerable server. This includes executing arbitrary code, accessing sensitive data, modifying system configurations, and potentially pivoting to other systems within the network.
- Full system compromise: Complete control of the server could lead to complete compromise of the website and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
- File Upload: The attacker uses the file upload functionality of the CMS to upload a malicious file.
- HTTP Request: After the malicious file is uploaded, it can be accessed via a web browser, triggering the execution of the payload.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the target server to upload the malicious file and then to make the HTTP request to the shell.
- Access to the CMS: The attacker needs to be able to utilize the file upload functionality of the CMS (either through a public facing function or after exploiting an authentication bypass).

**Additional Information:**
The provided information from the github repository confirms the vulnerability by stating:
"It is possible to upload a remote shell (e.g. aspx) to the server and then call upon it to receive a reverse shell from the victim server."
It also details the location where the uploaded file is placed "/Content/Template/root/reverse-shell.aspx" and how it can be triggered.
