Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-36916:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability stems from the plugin's method of retrieving and utilizing user IP addresses within SQL queries. Specifically, the `hmwp_get_user_ip` function fetches IP addresses from various HTTP headers, including `X-Forwarded-For`, which can be manipulated by an attacker. This user-supplied data is then directly inserted into a SQL query without proper sanitization or parameterization, leading to SQL injection.
*   **Unprotected Reset Token Exposure:** The second vulnerability arises from how the plugin handles the display of a reset token. The `die_message` function, triggered by the `die_message` GET parameter and when `is_admin()` evaluates to true, directly outputs the reset token (`hmwp_reset_token`) onto the page. This token can be used to deactivate the plugin, and is accessible to unauthenticated users, as it does not perform capability checks before outputting the token.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** Improper sanitization of user-supplied IP addresses leads to the ability to inject arbitrary SQL commands, potentially allowing data breaches, modification, or deletion.
*   **Insecure Direct Object Reference/Information Disclosure:** The lack of access control on the `die_message` function allows unauthenticated users to access sensitive information (the reset token), which is intended for administrative purposes.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Data Breach:** An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the WordPress database.
    *   **Data Manipulation:** Attackers could modify or delete data within the database.
    *   **Privilege Escalation:** In some scenarios, SQL injection can be leveraged to gain administrative access to the system.
*   **Unprotected Reset Token Exposure:**
    *   **Denial of Service:** An attacker can retrieve the reset token and use it to deactivate the plugin, disrupting its functionality and potentially causing a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **SQL Injection:** By sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious payload in one of the IP address headers (e.g., `X-Forwarded-For`).
*   **Unprotected Reset Token Exposure:** Accessing a specific URL with the `die_message` parameter set to `new_admin`, such as `/wp-admin/admin-ajax.php?die_message=new_admin&action=heartbeat`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.
*  **Unprotected Reset Token Exposure:**
    *   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
    *   The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerabilities were discovered by Patchstack.
*   The vulnerabilities were present in versions 6.2.3 and below of the "Hide My WP" plugin.
*   The issues were fixed in version 6.2.4.
*   Patchstack provided a virtual patch for its users before the official fix was released.
* The SQL injection was mitigated by sanitizing the IP address using PHP's `filter_var` and using `$wpdb->prepare`.
* The reset token exposure was fixed by adding a capability check using `current_user_can` to ensure that only users with the `manage_options` capability could access the vulnerable code block.
