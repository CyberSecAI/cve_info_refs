- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Email notifications of messages could have the link back to the original message hidden by HTML.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper handling of HTML content in email notifications leading to potential phishing.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The link back to the original message could be hidden, potentially leading to phishing attacks if attackers embed malicious links within the HTML content.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could craft a malicious message that includes HTML, which, when sent as a notification, would hide the legitimate link and could substitute a malicious one.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send messages that trigger email notifications, and control the content of those messages to include HTML.
