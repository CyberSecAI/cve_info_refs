How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

# Backup Migration

## Description

**Try it out on your free dummy site: Click here => [https://tastewp.com/plugins/backup-backup](https://demo.tastewp.com/bmi).**

(this trick works for all plugins in the WP repo – just replace “wordpress” with “tastewp” in the URL)

Creating a backup of your site has never been easier!

Simply install the plugin, click on “Create backup now” – done.

You can also schedule backups, e.g. define that a backup should be taken automatically every week (or every day/month).

Use a wide choice of configuration options:

* Define exactly which files / databases should be in the backup, and which not
* Define where the backup will be stored (as of now, only a local option is available, but we’ll expand this soon)
* Define what name your backup should have, in which instances you should receive a notification email, and much more

This plugin is all in one solution if you need to migrate your site to another host or just restore the local backup.

Note: This (free) version is limited to backups of 2GB in size. For unlimited sizes, please have a look at the [Premium Plugin](https://backupbliss.com). The code of this free plugin is licensed under [GPLv3](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html), however, we claim rights to other content. Please read the full [Terms of Use](https://backupbliss.com/terms) that touch other points as well and apply in entirety.

If any questions come up, please ask us in the [Support Forum](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/backup-backup) – we’re always happy to help!

## FAQ

### How do I create my first backup?

Click on “Create backup now” on the settings page of the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin.

BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging will by default create a backup that contains everything from your site, except the BackupBliss plugin’s own backups and WordPress installation – if you want to include the WordPress installation as well, tick the checkbox in the section “What will be backed up?”.

You can download backup or migrate your backup (use the plugin as a WordPress duplicator) immediately after the backup has been created.

### How do I restore a backup?

* If your backup is **located on your site**: Go to the BackupBliss Backup Migration Staging plugin screen, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab where you have your backups list, click on the Restore button next to the backup you would like to restore.
* If your backup is **located on another site**: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen on site #1, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab where you have the backups list, click on the “Copy Link”-button in the “Actions”-column. Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen on site #2, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab, click on “Super-quick migration”, paste the copied link, and hit the “Restore now!” button. This process will first import the backup and then restore it, i.e. Backup Migrate also serves as backup importer.
* If your backup is *located on another device*: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab, and click on the “Upload backup files” button. After the upload, click on the Restore button next to the backup you would like to restore.
* If your backup is *located on Google Drive*: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen, then to the plugin section “Where shall the backup(s) be stored?”, turn ON the Google Drive option, and connect to your account. After that, the plugin will sync the available backup files in the plugin section “Manage & Restore Backups” from where you will be able to run Restore.

### How do I migrate or clone my site?

Migrate (or clone) a WordPress site by creating a full backup on the site that you want to migrate (clone) – site #1.

* To transfer website **directly from site #1 to site #2**: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen on site #1, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab where you have the backups list, click on the Copy Link button in the Actions column. Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen on site #2, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab, click on “Super-quick migration”, paste the copied link, and hit the “Restore now!” button. Make sure that the backup file on site #1 is accessible by setting “Accessible via direct link?” to “Yes” in the plugin section “Where shall the backup(s) be stored?”
* To migrate the website **indirectly**: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen, then to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) tab, and click on the “Upload backup files” button. After the upload, click on the Restore button next to the backup you would like to restore.
* To migrate the website with *Google Drive*: Go to the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin screen, then to the plugin section “Where shall the backup(s) be stored?”, turn ON the Google Drive option, and connect to your account. After that, the plugin will sync the available backup files in the plugin section “Manage & Restore Backups” from where you will be able to run Restore.

### Where can I find my backups?

BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging allows you to download backups, migrate backups, or delete backups directly from the plugin screen Manage & Restore Backup(s). By default, the migrator plugin will store a backup to /wordpress/wp-content/backup-migration but you can change the backup location to anywhere you please.

### How to run automatic backups?

Enabling automatic backups is done on the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin’s home screen, just next to the “Create backup now!” button. Auto backup can run on a monthly, weekly, or daily basis. You can set the exact time (and day) and how many automatic backups would you like to keep in the same BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin section. We recommend that you optimize the number of backups that will be kept according to available space.

### How big are backup files?

Backup file size depends on the criteria you select in the “What will be backed up?” section of the BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin. There you can see file/folder size calculations as you Save your settings. Usually, WordPress’ Uploads folder is the heaviest, while Databases are the lightest. If you are looking to save up space, you might want to deselect Plugins and WordPress installation folders, as you can usually download those anytime from WP sources.

### Is the backup creation and site migration free?

Yes. You can create full site backups, and automatic backups, and migrate your site (duplicate site) free of charge. [BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging Pro](https://sellcodes.com/oZxnXtc2) provides more sophisticated filters and selections of files that will be included/excluded from backups (affecting backup size), faster backup creation times, number of external backup storage locations, backup encryption, backup file compression methods, advanced backup triggers, additional backup notifications by email, priority support, and more.

### ⭐️ NEW! How to create staging sites?

You can easily set up a staging environment for your website with the BackupBliss plugin. You can choose to create a staging site either on your server / machine or on [TasteWP](https://tastewp.com/). Both options are free!

1. To create a staging site on your server, navigate to the plugin section “Create a staging site”, select “Your server & domain”, define a custom path if you wish, and click on the button “Create staging site!”.
2. To create a stage site on a free WordPress sandbox platform – [TasteWP](https://tastewp.com/), select the option “TasteWP (external server)”, then select a backup file that will be used, and click on the button “Create staging site!”.

### Is cloud backup available?

Backup to Google Drive is now available in the [BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging Pro](https://sellcodes.com/oZxnXtc2)

Upcoming storage options will include: FTP, Amazon S3, Rackspace, DreamObjects, OpenStack, Google Cloud, SFTP/SCP, Microsoft Azure, OneDrive, Backblaze, and more.

### ⭐️ NEW! How do I back up to Google Drive?

In order to automatically upload your site backups to Google Drive, you will need a [Pro version](https://sellcodes.com/oZxnXtc2) of the plugin. Once installed and activated, navigate to the plugin section “Where shall the backup(s) be stored?”, and turn ON the Google Drive feature. Click on the button Connect, and select a Google account you want to connect to. Once it is connected, your backup files from the website will start to sync to your Google Drive. You can monitor the process in the plugin section “Manage & Restore Backups”

### How are you better than other backup/migration plugins?

Besides having the most intuitive interface and smoothest user experience, BackupBliss – Backup Migration Staging plugin will always strive to give you more than any competitor:

– Updraftplus: They charge for migration, with our plugin it’s free;

– All-in-One WP Migration: In the free version, compared to our plugin – they don’t have selective/partial backups; they lack advanced options and each external storage is on a separate extension plugin; they have no automatic backups;

– Duplicator: In the free version, compared to our plugin – they have no selective backups, exclusion rules, no automatic backups and no migration;

– WPvivid: In the free version, compared to our plugin – they don’t have selective/partial backups, exclusion rules, or automatic backups;

– BackWPup: In the free version, compared to our plugin – they lack restore options, backups are slower, automatic backups are dependant on wp cron;

– Backup Guard: In the free version, compared to our plugin – they have no selective backups, exclusion rules; no direct migration;

– XCloner: Automatic backups are dependant on wp cron; full restore not available on a local server;

– Total Upkeep: They lack the advanced selective backups and exclusion rules, lacks a monthly backup schedule

### How to upload my backup file?

Uploading a backup can be simply done by navigating to the Manage & Restore Backup(s) section of the BM plugin (tab on the right side). There you have the “Upload backup file” button, after clicking on it, you need to select a proper backup that is made by this plugin only. You cannot use backups from other plugins (to restore those, go back to those plugins and restore them this way). If you use “Super-quick migration” (section b), your backup will be automatically uploaded. If you are having trouble uploading the backup file, go bac and ensure that the folder designated for backups is writable. You can find the backup destination in the plugin section “Where shall the backup(s) be stored?

I’m sorry but the plugin doesn’t work, a larger backup will collapse. Migration doesn’t work. Deleted.
