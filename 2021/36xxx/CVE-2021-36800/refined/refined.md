Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-36800:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The Akaunting application allows for the execution of arbitrary PHP code provided by the user. This is due to a lack of input sanitization in the `Money.php` middleware component. Specifically, the application checks if a given value is callable and, if so, executes it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Code Injection:** The application executes unsanitized user-controlled PHP code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to a shell on the host operating system. This can be used to gain control of the server, install malware, or pivot to other systems within the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is triggered by sending a crafted POST request to `/{company_id}/sales/invoices/{invoice_id}` with a malicious payload in the `items[0][price]` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker must be authenticated as a user with permissions to add or modify sales invoices.
