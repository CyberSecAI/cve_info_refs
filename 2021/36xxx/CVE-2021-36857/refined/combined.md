This review, is NOT about the plugin itself, just the annoying nag screen.
Naturally, I understand the need and desire to receive feedback. However, it is super annoying that you ask this while I am not working with or in your application. It clutters my screen and is very disruptive. Hence this less pleasant reaction.
p.s. Unfortunately, I haven’t had time to work with this plugin yet. (bug hunting elsewhere)

It’s a good idea to have all quotes on one page. This seemed to be a good choice. We choose Layout 1 with carousel and it worked fine until we switched to layout 2, updated and everything vanished.

Free version is lovely, I upgraded to pro and the plugin wouldn’t function. Contacted support which was unhelpful and ignored me once I requested a refund, after going to paypal they waited until the last day to reply to me to file a ticket (which I had already done) and ignored my reply after that. Don’t waste your money here.

Very simple plugin to use, thankyou. I’m just using the free version which is a bit limited in formatting, but am considering upgrading to Pro

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
