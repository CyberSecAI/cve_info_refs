Based on the provided content, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-36801:

**CVE-2021-36801: Akaunting Authentication Bypass in Company Selection**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization checks when a user attempts to modify their associated company. The application allows a user to change the company their account is associated with by modifying the `companies[0]` parameter during profile update requests.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Authentication Bypass:** A user can bypass authorization controls and gain access to another company's data by manipulating the request parameters.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can view and modify information from another company by changing their associated company in their profile settings. This could lead to unauthorized access, data breaches, and manipulation of sensitive information, depending on the permissions of the compromised account within the new company.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack is performed by intercepting a legitimate request to update a user's profile and modifying the `companies[0]` parameter in the request to the ID of a different company.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker must be authenticated as a user within the Akaunting application.
    *   The attacker needs to know or guess the ID of the target company.
    *   The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests.

This vulnerability was fixed in Akaunting version 2.1.13.
