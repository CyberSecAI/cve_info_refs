- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation in Dell BIOS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation leading to arbitrary code execution.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A local, authenticated attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution within System Management RAM (SMRAM).
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation via a System Management Interrupt (SMI).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs local access to the system and must be an authenticated user with administrative privileges.
