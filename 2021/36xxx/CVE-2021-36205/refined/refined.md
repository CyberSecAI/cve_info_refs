Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36205:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The content from CISA directly references CVE-2021-36205 and provides specific details about its impact on Johnson Controls' Metasys product. Therefore, this content is relevant to the specified CVE.

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from an **Incomplete Cleanup** of session tokens. Specifically, under certain circumstances, the session token is not cleared upon logout.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   The primary weakness is the failure to invalidate session tokens upon user logout in Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS servers.
    *   This is categorized as CWE-459 (Incomplete Cleanup).
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   A remote attacker could potentially reuse a session token that was not cleared after a user logged out.
    *   This could lead to unauthorized access to the system, potentially gaining control, viewing sensitive information or modifying building configurations.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The attack vector is remote network exploitation (AV:N).
    *   An attacker would need to obtain a valid session token, which may be possible through network eavesdropping.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker requires network access to the Metasys server.
    *   The attacker would need to somehow obtain a valid session token. This is made difficult by the fact that the attack complexity is high (AC:H).
    *   The attacker does *not* need to have any specific privileges (PR:N). User interaction is not required (UI:N).

**3. Affected Products:**

*   Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS servers versions 10 and 11.

**4. Mitigations:**

*   Johnson Controls recommends upgrading to specific patches:
    *   Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers: Version 10 with patch 10.1.5
    *   Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS Servers: Version 11 with patch 11.0.2
*   CISA and Johnson Controls both recommend minimizing network exposure of control system devices. This includes:
    *   Isolating control system networks from the business network with firewalls.
    *   Using secure remote access methods like VPNs (with the caveat that VPNs themselves need to be secured).

**5. Additional Notes**

*   The CISA advisory notes that there are no known public exploits specifically targeting this vulnerability.
*   The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 8.1, indicating a high severity.

**Summary of findings:**

This vulnerability allows an attacker to potentially hijack a session by reusing an improperly cleared session token. The root cause is incomplete cleanup of session tokens on the Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS server, and the main risk is unauthorized access to the system. Patches are available, and standard security practices like network segmentation and use of VPNs is recommended.
