**Root Cause:** The WP Subscribe plugin, in versions <= 1.2.12, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This implies that user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being rendered on the page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core vulnerability is XSS, which allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful XSS attack allows a malicious actor to inject scripts (like redirects, ads, HTML) into the website, which are executed when a user visits the compromised page. This can lead to:
  - Website defacement
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Stealing of user cookies or session information
  - Display of unwanted content (advertisements)

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific input vector that leads to the XSS vulnerability is not explicitly stated in this content. However, XSS vulnerabilities typically arise from user-controlled inputs, such as form fields, URL parameters, or any other data that is not properly sanitized.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need the ability to inject malicious script into the website through vulnerable input parameters or fields within the plugin.
- It is mentioned the attacker needs administrator privilege, this may indicate that the vulnerability is located within the admin panel, however it is not very clear.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is classified as having a "low" severity and "low" priority.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 1.2.13 and later.
- The software is considered "abandoned" as it has not been updated in over a year.
- The OWASP Top 10 category is A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
