Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36706:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `set_sys_cmd` function in the `adm.cgi` binary directly passes the value of the `command` parameter from a HTTP POST request to the `system` function without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:**  The primary weakness is a command injection vulnerability. By manipulating the `command` parameter, an attacker can execute arbitrary shell commands on the underlying operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary shell commands with the privileges of the `root` user.
*   **Full System Compromise:** This can lead to complete control over the affected router, allowing the attacker to perform various malicious activities, including data theft, malware installation, and botnet inclusion.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `adm.cgi` endpoint.
*   **`page` Parameter:** The request must include a `page` parameter with the value set to `sysCMD`.
*  **`command` Parameter:**  The malicious command is injected through the `command` parameter in the POST data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the admin console before exploiting this command injection vulnerability.

**Additional Notes:**
*  The provided write-up also identifies two other command injection vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-36707, CVE-2021-36705) and one unauthenticated password reset vulnerability (CVE-2021-36708) in the same router.
* The vulnerable code snippet shows that the `command` parameter is directly passed to `sprintf` with a format string that inserts the `command` value. This format string is then used in a call to the `system` function. This is a very insecure way to handle user input.
* The write-up includes a proof-of-concept that uses `msfvenom` to generate a reverse shell payload, `curl` to download it to the router, and then execute it.
