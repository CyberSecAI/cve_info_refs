How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## FAQ

### How do I get started with QSM â A free quiz maker in WordPress?

The quickest way to build a quiz is using the **QSM â Block Editor** in WordPress. Simply navigate to a New Page or Post, select the QSM Block, and add a new quiz. Enter the quizâs name, set advanced options if required, and click **Create Quiz**. From there, start adding questions and options, choosing question types from the right-side panel, and Save your draft. Once ready, click Publish to post the quiz on the WordPress website.

Alternatively, you can create a quiz or survey using the default method, which offers more features and settings. If you have started a quiz in the block editor, simply save the draft and go to QSM > Quizzes/Surveys to edit your existing quiz or add a new one to continue building it with full customization options.

### Can this plugin be translated?

Yes, itâs completely possible! With integration to the WPML plugin, this **online quiz tool** enables you to translate your quizzes and surveys into multiple languages. For more information, refer to the documentation on [translating the QSM WordPress plugin](https://quizandsurveymaster.com/docs/advanced-topics/qsm-wpml/#Translating_QSM_Defaults).

### How can I get access to all advanced features?

To access advanced features, integrations, and themes, you can upgrade to the [QSM All Access plan](https://quizandsurveymaster.com/pricing/). The pro license gives you access to our 40 add-ons such as advanced assessment, flashcards, email integrations, advanced analytics, and 8 premium themes

### Can I create paid quizzes and surveys?

Yes, this is achievable by our [Payment Integration add-on](https://quizandsurveymaster.com/downloads/paypal-and-stripe-payment-integration/). Using **PayPal** and **Stripe**, you can easily add payments to your online quizzes and surveys, allowing you to monetize your content easily.

### Can I display different content based on user responses?

Absolutely! With QSM, you can create conditional logic-based **quizzes** and surveys, where specific questions or content are displayed based on the userâs previous responses. This feature is particularly useful for creating personalized experiences, such as personality quizzes or branching surveys.

### Can I collect and analyze user data from my quizzes and surveys?

Yes, QSM allows you to collect and analyze user data from your quizzes and surveys. You can view detailed reports and results in the admin area, including user responses, scores, and completion rates. Additionally, you can integrate with popular email marketing platforms like Mailchimp and ActiveCampaign for lead generation and follow-up campaigns.

### Is QSM compatible with other plugins and themes?

As a WordPress quiz maker, QSM is designed to be compatible with most other plugins and themes. However, in case of any conflicts or issues, our team provides comprehensive documentation, including common conflict solutions and guidelines for theme compatibility.

We extensively tested almost all the popular Quiz plugins out there and picked QSM as the best one. QSM is full of features and functionality. With all the beautiful themes, we can create Quiz for any of our niches.
Suman was very cordial and helpful, solved our every query and issues patiently. Appreciated all the support.

The plugin is precisely what I needed to create lead magnet quizzes for my sites. I found a small bug and it was quickly solved by the team, even though I only use the free version.

Support was prompt. However there are lot of small UX issues that grow into big ones. Make sure you click save and are deliberate with all actions you make, otherwise quizzes wonât show up the way youâre looking for them to. That said, it gives you a lot more flexibility than other quiz platforms (admittedly I havenât gotten far with many others). Good luck and have fun! -d
