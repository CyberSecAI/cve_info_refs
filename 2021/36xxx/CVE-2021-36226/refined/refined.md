Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from a combination of factors:
    - A default, unauthenticated user account ("nobody") with a blank password can be used to access authenticated API endpoints.
    - The firmware update API (`Update.php`) allows firmware uploads via HTTP POST requests with only user-level authentication which is bypassable with the nobody account, and lacks cryptographic verification.
    - The system uses a shell script (`updateFirmwareFromFile.sh`) to process the uploaded firmware, which then calls an `upload_firmware` binary. There are no proper checks on the firmware content which allow uploading a malicious payload.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** The "nobody" user with a blank password allows bypassing authentication checks on the firmware update API.
- **Insecure Firmware Update API:** The firmware update API allows unauthenticated or weakly authenticated firmware uploads via HTTP POST.
- **Missing cryptographic verification of uploaded firmware:** Lack of cryptographic checks on firmware allows attackers to upload malicious firmware if the format is known.
- **Insufficient Access Control:** User-level authentication is insufficient for a critical operation such as firmware update and allows the "nobody" user to access the endpoint.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can upload and install a malicious firmware image, leading to complete control over the affected device.
- **Persistent Backdoor:** The attacker can establish a persistent backdoor by modifying system files during the malicious firmware flashing process.
- **Device Compromise:** Complete compromise of the Western Digital NAS device, including data and settings.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The attack is performed over the network through the HTTP/HTTPS interface of the NAS device.
- **HTTP POST request:** Exploitation involves sending a crafted HTTP POST request containing the malicious firmware to a vulnerable API endpoint.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable NAS device, ideally from the local network but potentially from the Internet if remote management is enabled.
- **Knowledge of API endpoints and required parameters:** The attacker must know the URL of the vulnerable firmware update API and the required parameters, including using the "nobody" username and an empty password for authentication bypass.
- **Knowledge of firmware format:** The attacker needs to know the format required for the firmware image upload (this was obtainable from WD GPL package)
- **Ability to create a malicious firmware:** The attacker needs the ability to create or modify a firmware image to include malicious payload/backdoor

**Additional Details:**
- The researchers discovered the vulnerability in the MyCloud OS 3 firmware.
- Western Digital released MyCloud OS 5, which is a complete rewrite of the operating system, and as a result, this specific vulnerability no longer exists in the latest OS.
- The researchers were planning to demonstrate the exploit at Pwn2Own Tokyo 2020, but Western Digital released OS 5 shortly before the event, rendering their exploit useless for the competition, as exploits must work against the latest supported firmware version.
- Western Digital did not officially patch this vulnerability for OS 3, and instead suggested that users upgrade to OS 5 (if their devices are supported), or disable remote access.
- The researchers released a patch to address the authentication bypass, but it requires being applied after each reboot.
- The researchers found a way to downgrade from OS5 to OS3, using a web interface exposed in rescue mode using UART.
