Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper file type validation and sanitization in the "Phone Shop Sales Managements System 1.0". The application allows users to upload arbitrary files through multiple endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Arbitrary File Upload:** The system fails to restrict the type of files that can be uploaded, allowing attackers to upload malicious PHP files.
*   **Lack of Input Validation:** The application does not validate the uploaded file's content, allowing for the injection of executable code.
*   **Insecure File Storage:** Uploaded files are stored in publicly accessible directories within the web serverâ€™s document root, allowing direct access to uploaded files.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file containing malicious code, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the server.
*   **Full System Compromise:** Through RCE, an attacker could potentially gain complete control of the server, leading to data theft, data manipulation, and further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST Requests:** The attack is carried out using specially crafted HTTP POST requests to the `/osms/Execute/ExAddProduct.php` and `/osms/Execute/ExChangePicture.php` endpoints.
*   **Multipart Form Data:** The attacker includes a malicious PHP file within the `ProductImage` and `Image` fields of the multipart form data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
*   **Basic HTTP Knowledge:** The attacker needs to understand how to create a multipart form POST request.
*   **Knowledge of Target Application:** The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable endpoints (ExAddProduct.php and ExChangePicture.php) and their associated request parameters.

**Technical Details:**

*   **PoC 1:** The attacker uploads a PHP file (rev.php) with the content `<?php echo "result: ";system($_GET['rev']); ?>` through `/osms/Execute/ExAddProduct.php`, naming it as the `ProductImage`. This allows the attacker to execute system commands by making GET requests to the uploaded file located at `/osms/assets/img/Product_Uploaded/rev.php?rev=<command>`.
*   **PoC 2:** The attacker uploads a PHP file (rev.php) with the content `<?php echo "output: ";system($_GET['rev']); ?>` through `/osms/Execute/ExChangePicture.php`, naming it as the `Image`. This allows the attacker to execute system commands by making GET requests to the uploaded file located at `/osms/assets/img/Profile_Uploaded/rev.php?rev=<command>`.
