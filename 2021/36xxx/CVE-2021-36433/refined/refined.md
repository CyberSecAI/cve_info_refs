The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities within the jocms project.

**Root Cause:** The root cause is the lack of proper input sanitization and the direct embedding of user-controlled data into SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection in multiple locations:
    *   `jocms/apps/mask/inc/mask.php`:  The `id` parameter from the JSON payload is directly embedded into a SQL query in the `jo_get_masks()` function.
    *   `jocms/apps/mask/inc/getmask.php`: Similar to the above, the `content` parameter from the JSON payload is directly embedded into a SQL query.
    *   `jocms/apps/mask/mask.php`: The `id`, `name`, and `code` POST parameters are directly used in SQL queries in the `jo_set_mask()` function. The code parameter is first processed with HTML functions, then embedded.
    *    `jocms/apps/mask/mask.php`: The `id` parameter from the GET request is directly used in the `jo_delete_mask()` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Data Breach:** An attacker could extract sensitive information from the database.
*   **Data Manipulation:** An attacker could modify or delete data in the database.
*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:**  By using techniques like `ATTACH DATABASE` an attacker could potentially write malicious code to the server and execute it.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerabilities in `mask.php` and `getmask.php` can be exploited by sending crafted JSON data in the request body.
*   **HTTP POST Request:** The vulnerability in `mask.php` related to updating or inserting masks can be exploited by sending crafted POST data in the request body.
*   **HTTP GET Request:** The vulnerability in `mask.php` related to deleting a mask can be exploited by sending a crafted GET request.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
*   No authentication is explicitly mentioned as being required for the exploitation of these vulnerabilities in the provided text, but it's implied that access to the application is needed.

**Additional Details:**
* The provided content contains proof of concept payloads for each vulnerability, including a payload that writes a PHP backdoor to the server.
* The issue was fixed by implementing SQL prepared statements, as mentioned in the issue comments.
