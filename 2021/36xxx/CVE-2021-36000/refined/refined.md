- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Access of memory location after end of buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write, leading to arbitrary code execution. Specifically, accessing a memory location beyond the allocated buffer boundaries.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user. Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute malicious code on the victim's machine.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based (AV:N) and requires user interaction (UI:R). An attacker could potentially craft a malicious file that, when opened by the victim, would trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker does not need any specific privileges to exploit this vulnerability (PR:N), but they require the user to open a malicious file.
