There are several reviews plugins available.
This one beats them all.I would like to see the developers pay a little more attention to it since they could improve on it and even charge a nominal price.

Very bad plugin.
Google doesn’t show the snippets.
When I ask this to the support, they said that I need to wait more. But I’ve already waited more than 1 year! And still no Google snippets. Go with much more a better plugin.

After a week and no respons i deactivated the plugin. I, and support of Starfish, was not able to activate the license. I need to go on. I have a waiting customer.

### [Duplicate reviews, errors in the code, bad localization](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/duplicate-reviews-errors-in-the-code-bad-localization/)

[deeprus](https://profiles.wordpress.org/deeprus/ "Posts by deeprus")

The plugin code contains a bunch of errors. For example, you will never see a warning if you have not rated a review, even if the rating field in the settings is required.
Very bad localization. Many text strings in the plugin are not translated at all, as they are hardcoded.
Finally, reviews are sent multiple times. Several duplicate records appear in the database and the same number of notifications are sent to e-mail.
So, I does NOT recommend this plugin at all!

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
