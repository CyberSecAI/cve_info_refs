I was looking for a testimonials plugin that kept them as a post type in the WordPress backend, since I was migrating from a theme that had this capability built-in. I tried the free version, liked it and went for the pro version as well. Support was great and quickly implemented some requests and fixes. Very recommended!

None of the samples in documentation are available in free version. In fact, the documentation refers to paid version so if you are using the demo or documentation to assess, what you see is not what you get. Still, free version does show testimonials – albeit one at a time. I’m going to keep looking.

I tried out the free version of Super Testimonials and then instantly went for buying the Pro version. Had some issues with the plugin, but the support team was prompt and fast enough to resolve my issues efficiently. In love with the plugin! Definitely recommended.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
