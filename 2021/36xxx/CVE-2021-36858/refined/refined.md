Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-36858

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue, specifically within the "Super Testimonials" WordPress plugin. The root cause seems to stem from insufficient input sanitization, allowing malicious scripts to be injected.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The plugin failed to properly sanitize user-supplied input, making it vulnerable to XSS attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful XSS attack can allow a malicious actor to inject client-side scripts into a website. These scripts can be used to:
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Display unwanted advertisements.
    - Steal user session data.
    - Modify the appearance or content of the website.
    - Perform other malicious actions within the user's browser context.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts through input fields, or any other areas where user input is processed without sufficient sanitization within the plugin.
- This could potentially be exploited through the plugin's settings or the testimonial submission form.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious input through areas that do not have proper sanitization and are processed by the plugin. In this case, the attacker needs administrator privileges.
-   The attacker does not need to be directly on the target system, but rather manipulate input that the plugin uses when displaying information to the users.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability is classified as a low priority issue.
- The vulnerable versions are <= 2.6.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 2.7.
- The vulnerability was reported by thiennv.
- The plugin did not have a VDP (Vulnerability Disclosure Program) at the time of the report.

**Summary**
The "Super Testimonials" WordPress plugin had a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to inadequate sanitization of user-provided input. This could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the website, impacting users through redirects, data theft, or other malicious actions. The vulnerability was resolved in version 2.7.
