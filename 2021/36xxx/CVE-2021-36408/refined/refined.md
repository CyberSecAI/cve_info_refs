Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36408:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- A heap-use-after-free vulnerability occurs in the `intra_border_computer<unsigned char>::fill_from_image()` function within the `intrapred.h` file of the libde265 library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Heap-use-after-free:** The vulnerability arises from accessing a memory region that has already been freed. Specifically, the code attempts to read data at address `0x625000007e04` after the memory it belongs to has been deallocated.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Crash:** The immediate impact of this vulnerability is a crash of the application (`dec265`) due to the use-after-free error, as observed with AddressSanitizer. This can lead to a denial of service (DoS) scenario. The Debian LTS advisory states "which may result in denial of or have unspecified other impact.".

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious HEVC file:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted HEVC (H.265) video file with the `dec265` decoder.
- **File Input**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious HEVC file as input to the vulnerable program.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide a specially crafted HEVC file to a vulnerable application that uses `libde265`.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges on the system, only the capability to invoke `dec265` with a crafted input file.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided Github issue details the steps required to reproduce the vulnerability, including the specific compiler flags to use with AddressSanitizer.
- The fix for this issue involves addressing how the library handles situations where the Sequence Parameter Set (SPS) image size changes without refreshing the Picture Parameter Set (PPS), as noted in the commit message `[fix streams where SPS image size changes without refreshing PPS]`.
- The Debian Security Advisory (DSA) and LTS Advisory (DLA) confirm this vulnerability along with others within the libde265 package. The fix version is identified as 1.0.11-0+deb11u1 for the stable distribution (bullseye) and 1.0.3-1+deb10u1 for Debian 10 buster.
- The issue was assigned CVE-2021-36408.
- The vulnerability occurs during intra-prediction decoding.
