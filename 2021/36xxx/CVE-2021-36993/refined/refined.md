- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Memory leaks
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unspecified memory management issues leading to memory leaks.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation may affect service availability.
- **Attack vectors**: Not specified, but likely involves triggering a specific operation or sequence of operations that lead to a memory leak.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Likely requires the ability to execute or trigger operations that lead to the memory leak, which may be accessible through normal app usage or specific system calls.
