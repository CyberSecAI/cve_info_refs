Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described by CVE-2021-36221:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a race condition within the `net/http/httputil` package in Go. Specifically, the issue occurs in the `ReverseProxy` when its handler aborts with `ErrAbortHandler`, often triggered by an error during copying of a proxied response body.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Race Condition:** The primary weakness is a race condition. The `ReverseProxy` does not properly close the request body after the handler panics due to `ErrAbortHandler`. This leaves the connection's `bufio.Reader` and `bufio.Writer` potentially accessible to other goroutines that might still be reading from it.
*   **Improper Resource Management:** There's a lack of proper resource management, specifically the request body is not closed upon handler panic, leading to potential race conditions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker could potentially force the conditions leading to the race condition, causing a panic in the `ReverseProxy`, resulting in a denial of service. The panic occurs due to a racy read of the `persistConn` after the handler panics.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based:** The vulnerability can be triggered by sending specially crafted HTTP requests to a service using `httputil.ReverseProxy`. This could happen if the upstream server is sending a response that causes the `ReverseProxy` to panic (e.g., a large or malformed response).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a server using the vulnerable Go code.
*   **Trigger Handler Panic:** The attacker needs to be able to cause an `ErrAbortHandler` panic, typically by sending a request that causes an upstream server to return an error during body copying or causing an invalid response, thereby triggering a panic in `ReverseProxy`.

**Technical Details:**

*   The core issue lies in how Go handles request bodies in combination with the `httputil.ReverseProxy`'s behavior with `ErrAbortHandler`. The `*conn`'s reader and writer are returned to `sync.Pool` but the request body maintains an indirect reference to that reader and isn't closed, resulting in a race with other goroutines that may try to use it after it has been returned to the pool
*   The fix involves ensuring the request body is always closed when a handler panics with `ErrAbortHandler`
*   Several sources mention that this issue was resolved in Go versions 1.16.7 and 1.15.15.
*   The vulnerability is described in various contexts including Fedora updates, Debian LTS advisories, and Oracle security advisories.
