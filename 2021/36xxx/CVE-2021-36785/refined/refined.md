The provided content is related to CVE-2021-36785.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The "Miniorange Saml" extension fails to properly encode user input when outputting it in an HTML context.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability due to improper input encoding.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious scripts into web pages, potentially leading to:
    -   Session hijacking
    -   Defacement
    -   Redirecting users to malicious sites.
    -   Stealing user credentials
    -  Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious code via user-controlled input that is not properly sanitized before rendering in the HTML context.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs the ability to supply malicious input, potentially via forms or other user input vectors, which then renders on a page. The attacker requires a user to trigger this input by accessing the vulnerable page and/or by using a user with appropriate access to modify the data that would be rendered.
