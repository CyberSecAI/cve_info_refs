Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-36913

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a missing authorization, authentication, or nonce token check in a function within the "Redirection for Contact Form 7" plugin. This allows an unprivileged user to execute actions that require higher privileges.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Broken Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is a broken access control issue, meaning that the plugin doesn't properly verify if a user has the necessary permissions to perform certain actions.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An unauthenticated attacker could exploit this vulnerability to perform actions that are meant to be restricted to higher-privileged users. The specific impact would vary case by case, but could potentially lead to unauthorized modifications, data access or even complete takeover of the website.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves exploiting the plugin's functions that lack proper access control checks. Since it affects unauthenticated users, this is likely done through direct requests or through crafted requests from a malicious website

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit the vulnerability. An attacker without any user account can directly trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability is considered high priority with a CVSS score of 7.5.
- The vulnerable versions of the plugin are <= 2.4.0.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.6.0.
- Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate the issue.
