The provided content is related to CVE-2021-36212.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the sharing groups view. The application was not properly sanitizing the `SharingGroup.name` field when displaying it.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a stored XSS, where user-provided data, specifically `SharingGroup.name`, is not properly sanitized before being rendered in the view.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code within the `SharingGroup.name` field. When other users view the sharing group, this injected script would execute in their browsers, potentially allowing the attacker to steal session cookies, perform actions on behalf of the user, or redirect them to malicious websites.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker with the ability to modify the `SharingGroup.name` field, likely via a vulnerable form or API endpoint, can inject malicious code. The code will be stored and triggered when a user views the sharing group page.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with sufficient permissions to modify the name of a sharing group.

**Additional Details:**
The fix implemented in the commit `01521d614cb578de75a406394b4f0426f6036ba7` modifies the `app/View/SharingGroups/view.ctp` file by using `h()` to sanitize the `SharingGroup.name` when displaying it. This prevents the browser from executing the injected malicious scripts.
