The provided content is related to CVE-2021-36548.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the ability to insert arbitrary executable PHP code via the theme blog functionality in Monstra CMS version 3.0.4. Specifically, by editing the blog template, an attacker can inject malicious PHP code into the template. This code is then executed by the server when the page is loaded.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Unrestricted file upload/modification leading to arbitrary code execution
- Lack of input sanitization/validation when modifying templates
- Insecure theme editing functionality

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server. This can lead to:
- Full system compromise
- Data breach
- Malware installation
- Defacement of the website

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker needs to be logged into the administrative panel of the Monstra CMS.
- They then navigate to the theme editing section for the blog template.
- The attacker inserts malicious PHP code (a web shell) into the template via the edit functionality of the theme.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have administrative access to the Monstra CMS panel.
