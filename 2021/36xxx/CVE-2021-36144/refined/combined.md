dm: Reset virtio device before release

```
With virtio polling mode enabled, a timer is running in the virtio
backend service. And the timer will also be triggered if its frondend
driver didn't do the device reset in shutdown. A freed virtio device
will be accessed in the polling timer handler.

Do the virtio reset() callback specifically to clear the polling timer
before the free.
