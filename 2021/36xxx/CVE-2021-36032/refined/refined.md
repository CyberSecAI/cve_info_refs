Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36032:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper input validation (CWE-20)

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The software fails to properly validate input, leading to a privilege escalation.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to escalate their privileges.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is exploitable over a network (AV:N) with a low attack complexity (AC:L). User interaction is not required (UI:N).

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** A low privileged user (PR:L) can exploit the vulnerability to escalate privileges. Pre-authentication is required, meaning an attacker does not need to have administrative access initially to trigger the vulnerability.
