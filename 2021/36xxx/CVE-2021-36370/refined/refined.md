Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36370:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability lies in the fact that, when the SFTP VFS (Virtual File System) was initially implemented in Midnight Commander, the fingerprints of remote hosts were computed but **not verified**. This means that the system would connect to a remote host, obtain its fingerprint, but would not check if that fingerprint matched a previously known or trusted fingerprint. This lack of verification opens the door to man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Missing Host Key Verification:** The primary weakness is the absence of proper verification of host keys/fingerprints during SFTP connections. The system computed the fingerprint but did not perform a check against trusted keys.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Vulnerability:**  The vulnerability exposes users to potential man-in-the-middle attacks because a malicious actor can intercept the connection and present a fake server with a forged host key. The client, not verifying the key, would connect to the malicious server believing it is the legitimate server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Data Interception:** A successful MitM attack could allow an attacker to intercept all data transferred between the user and the remote server, including sensitive information like passwords and other credentials.
- **Data Manipulation:** The attacker could also manipulate data being transferred, potentially injecting malicious files or modifying existing files.
- **Loss of Confidentiality and Integrity:** Overall, a successful exploit would compromise both the confidentiality and integrity of the data exchanged over the SFTP connection.
- **Compromised User Accounts:** Stolen credentials can be used to access user accounts on the remote server.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** The attack vector is a man-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. An attacker positions themselves between the user's machine and the legitimate SFTP server.
- **Network Interception:** This could be done by intercepting the network traffic using various techniques.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to have network access that allows them to intercept the communication between the Midnight Commander client and the SFTP server.
- **Ability to Impersonate the Server:** The attacker needs to be able to set up a fake server that presents a host key to the client.

**Additional Notes from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability was discovered during an audit of open-source software by Manfred KAISER from AUT-milCERT.
- The fix for this vulnerability was included in Midnight Commander version 4.8.27, which now implements the host key verification.
- The provided code snippets showcase the implementation of the fix in `connection.c` which includes:
  - Reading the `known_hosts` file.
  - Comparing the received host key against the ones stored in `known_hosts`.
  - Prompting the user to accept or reject a new or modified host key.
  - Updating the `known_hosts` file when needed.
