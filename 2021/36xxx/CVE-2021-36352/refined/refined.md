Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36352:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization in the Care2x Hospital Information Management System. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize user-supplied data in several parameters of the POST request to `/modules/registration_admission/patient_register.php`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application is vulnerable to stored XSS because it stores unsanitized input in the database, which is later rendered on the web page, enabling malicious JavaScript execution within a user's browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's session.
- This can lead to session hijacking, account takeover, data theft, defacement, or other malicious activities. The provided text specifically notes that an attacker could "takeover any account".

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker sends a POST request to `/modules/registration_admission/patient_register.php`
- The malicious payload is included within the following parameters:
    -  `name_middle`
    -  `addr_str`
    -  `station`
    -  `name_maiden`
    -  `name_2`
    -  `name_3`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to access the application's login panel and have the privileges to access the `/modules/registration_admission/patient_register.php` page.
- The attacker needs to craft a malicious payload, typically consisting of JavaScript code, that will be executed within the victim's browser when the data is displayed.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable software is Care2x Hospital Information Management System, version <= 2.7 Alpha.
- The vulnerability was discovered by the Security For Everyone Team.
- The vendor was contacted but no updates or patches are available.
- The provided exploit example uses the payload `<script>alert(document.cookie)</script>` as a proof of concept.
