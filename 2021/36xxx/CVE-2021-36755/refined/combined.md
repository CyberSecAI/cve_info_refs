prevent XSS via admin-notifies system

```
The admin-notifies system takes user input from the X-Forwarded-For by header,
and injects it into html rendered by the browser in the admin-notification
system.  This patch appropriately escapes all such content injected into the
notification drawers.  This patch should prevent XSS attacks designed to
exploit user credentials or other access.  Thanks to Deja Vu Security -
Accenture, and Damien Sudol for reporting.
