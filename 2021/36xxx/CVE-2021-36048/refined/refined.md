Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36048:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is caused by **Improper Input Validation**. This means that the software does not adequately check or sanitize the input it receives, which can lead to unexpected behavior or security issues.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-20: Improper Input Validation:** The core weakness is the lack of proper validation of input data, making the software susceptible to exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system with the privileges of the current user. This means the attacker could potentially take full control of the affected application and system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be triggered by a specially crafted input.
*   The attack vector is described as local and requires user interaction.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to provide the specially crafted input to the application.
*   The attacker would need to be able to convince the user to process the malicious input.
*   The attacker does not need special privileges on the system, but does need to be able to interact with the software.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Critical" with a CVSS base score of 7.8.
*   This vulnerability affects Adobe XMP Toolkit SDK version 2020.1 and earlier.
*   The fix is included in the 2021.07 version of the SDK.
*   Multiple other vulnerabilities were found in the same software.

The Debian security advisory confirms that this CVE exists in `exempi`, which is an implementation of XMP and indicates that it can lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
