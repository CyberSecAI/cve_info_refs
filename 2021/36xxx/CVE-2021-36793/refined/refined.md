Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-36793:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The TYPO3 extension "Extbase Yaml Routes" (routes) uses the `CsrfTokenViewHelper` which discloses the user's session identifier directly to HTML output without proper cryptographic hashing.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: The user's session identifier is exposed in the HTML output.
- Inadequate Output Encoding: Lack of cryptographic hashing on the session identifier before output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The vulnerability itself cannot be exploited directly, but it can be chained with another attack, like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) to gain access to sensitive user information.
- By extracting the user's session identifier an attacker could potentially impersonate the user.

**Attack vectors:**
-  Requires a chained attack like Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) in the frontend output. The session identifier is exposed but an attacker would need a separate vector to inject malicious code that extracts this identifier

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
-  The attacker needs to be able to perform Cross-Site Scripting attack on the frontend of the application.
-  Low privileged access is sufficient for the initial XSS injection point.

**Additional Information:**
- The affected versions are 2.1.0 and below.
- The vulnerability severity is rated as medium.
- The fixed version is 2.1.1.
- The vulnerability is located in a third-party extension not part of the default TYPO3 installation.
