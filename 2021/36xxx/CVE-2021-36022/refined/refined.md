- **Root cause of vulnerability**: OS Command Injection
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to OS command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is exploitable over a network (AV:N) and requires low attack complexity (AC:L). Exploitation requires an attacker with administrative privileges (PR:H), and there is no user interaction required (UI:N). The scope of impact is changed (S:C), which could allow an attacker to impact resources beyond the affected component.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have administrative privileges to exploit this vulnerability. The attack can be performed remotely over the network.
