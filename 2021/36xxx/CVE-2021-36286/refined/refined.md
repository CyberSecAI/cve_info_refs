Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36286:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in how Dell SupportAssist handles file cleaning, specifically its inability to distinguish between NTFS junction points and physical folders.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary File Deletion:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to delete arbitrary files on the system.
- **NTFS Symbolic Link Exploitation:** The vulnerability is exploitable by using Windows NTFS symbolic links combined with NTFS junction points.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The SupportAssist clean files functionality doesn't validate the target of junction points, treating them as physical folders.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **High Integrity Impact:** Successful exploitation can allow a non-privileged user to delete files on the system that are normally only accessible by an administrator, potentially causing data loss or system instability.
- **High Availability Impact**:  Deletion of critical system files can cause the system to be unstable or unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack is carried out locally on the system.
- **Symbolic Link Manipulation:** An attacker creates a symbolic link in a user-accessible directory pointing to a junction point. The junction point then points to a target directory, whose content can only be modified by the admin user. When SupportAssist attempts to clean files in the symbolic link directory, the functionality follows the symbolic link and then the junction point, deleting files in the target location.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privilege:** The attacker needs to be a non-privileged user on the system.
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs local access to the target system.
- **Knowledge of NTFS:**  The attacker needs knowledge of how to create symbolic links and junction points in the Windows NTFS file system.

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided information mentions that the vulnerability exists in Dell SupportAssist Client Consumer versions 3.9.13.0 and any versions before that.
- Dell SupportAssist for Home PCs versions 3.9 and earlier and Dell SupportAssist for Business PCs versions 2.4.1 and earlier are affected.
- Updated versions are available: 3.10 for Home PCs and 3.0.0 for Business PCs.
- The CVSS score is 7.1 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:H/A:H
- The vulnerability is different from CVE-2021-36297, which involves a DLL hijacking vulnerability.
