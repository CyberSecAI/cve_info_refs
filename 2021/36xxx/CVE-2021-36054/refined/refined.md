Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36054:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a **heap-based buffer overflow**. This occurs when a program writes data beyond the allocated buffer on the heap memory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-122 (Heap-based Buffer Overflow):** The program does not properly validate the size of the input when writing to a heap-allocated buffer, leading to a buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Application denial-of-service:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to a local denial-of-service. The overflow corrupts memory, which causes the application to crash or become unstable and unusable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The attack vector is **local**, as indicated by the CVSS vector `AV:L`. This means the attacker must have local access to the system to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction is Required** as indicated by the CVSS vector `UI:R`. This means the attacker needs the victim to perform an action to trigger the vulnerability, such as opening a malformed file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs **local access** to the system.
*   The attacker needs to convince the user to perform an action to trigger the vulnerability.

**Summary**
CVE-2021-36054 is a heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability in Adobe XMP Toolkit SDK. A local attacker who convinces a user to open a malformed file can cause a denial of service.

The provided information also mentions that the vulnerability is fixed in version 2021.07 of Adobe XMP Toolkit SDK.
