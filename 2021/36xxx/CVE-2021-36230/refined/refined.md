Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36230:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stemmed from a lack of proper authorization checks in Terraform Enterprise when handling API requests made using run tokens. Specifically, a subset of API requests were not correctly validated.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary weakness was the failure to enforce proper authorization on API requests that were using run tokens. Run tokens, which should have limited scope, were improperly authorized to perform actions outside their intended permissions.
*  **Privilege Escalation**: The specific vulnerability allowed run tokens to invite new users to the organization, which is an administrative task.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** A user with plan access to a workspace could exploit this vulnerability to escalate their privileges by inviting new users to the organization.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **API Manipulation:** An attacker with plan access to a workspace can leverage the run token and make a subset of API calls to invite new users to the organization.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have plan access to a workspace within Terraform Enterprise.
*   They need to be able to make API requests to the Terraform Enterprise.

**Summary:**
CVE-2021-36230 is a privilege escalation vulnerability in Terraform Enterprise. It allows users with limited access to escalate their privileges by exploiting improperly authorized API requests made using run tokens.
