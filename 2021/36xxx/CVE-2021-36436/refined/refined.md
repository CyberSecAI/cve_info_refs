{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The Mobicint API for credit unions discloses sensitive information unnecessarily through the forgot password functionality.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Information Disclosure, potential for RCE (Remote Code Execution)",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can enumerate partial email addresses and user-entered data (potentially sensitive information) by manipulating the memberID parameter in the forgot password form. This can be combined with a member ID to potentially compromise the account. Additionally, a stack trace was generated with malformed input, suggesting a possibility of remote code execution.",
  "Attack vectors": "Manipulating the memberID field in the forgot password page by submitting different member ID values.",
   "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to access the forgot password form and have the ability to enumerate member ID values."
