Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36563:

**Root Cause:** The Checkmk management web console (versions 1.5.0 to 2.0.0p9) does not properly sanitize user input in various parameters of the WATO module. This lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious HTML and JavaScript code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Stored XSS:** Malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the application's database, causing the scripts to be executed when a user views the affected content. Specific areas include:
    *   Description fields in the customize menu (views, topics, etc.)
    *   Text to match of EC rules
    *   LDAP server and failover server settings
    *   Notification rules (title and topic of aux tags and tags).
*   **Reflected XSS:** While the primary focus is stored XSS, the description also mentions reflected XSS as a possibility.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Arbitrary Script Execution:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the victim's browser.
*   **Backdoor Creation:**  An attacker can potentially create a backdoor on the device.
*   **SecretAutomation Theft:** A user with monitor role could potentially steal the secretAutomation (API key for administrator functions) using stored XSS which could lead to creating a new administrator user and gaining full control over the system.
*   **Content Modification:** Persistent XSS allows modification of displayed content or changing victim's information.
*   **Hijacked Session:** Successful exploitation can occur with a valid session or a hijacked one.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Web Interface:** The attack is carried out through the web management interface of Checkmk.
*   **Malicious Input:** Attackers inject malicious scripts into vulnerable input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Access to Web Interface:** The attacker needs access to the Checkmk web management interface.
*   **User Permissions:** In some cases, the attacker needs permissions to edit items in the customize menu, rule settings, LDAP configuration, or notification rules. However, other areas might be exploitable by lower-privileged users (e.g., monitor role).
*   **Valid or Hijacked Session:**  The attacker needs to be logged in or have a hijacked session.

**Additional Notes**
*   The vulnerability affects versions 1.5.0 to 2.0.0p9 of Checkmk.
*   Patches were released in versions 2.0.0p4 and 2.0.0p11.
*   The content provides a detailed timeline of discovery, vendor communication, and patch release, plus links to the vendor's security advisories.
*   Proof of concept videos are included, demonstrating the exploit on versions 1.5.0p19 and 2.0.0p1.
