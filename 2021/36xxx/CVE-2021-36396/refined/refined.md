```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Insufficient redirect handling",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Blind SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) due to bypassing cURL blocked hosts/allowed ports restrictions.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can potentially make requests to internal or blocked resources from the server, although the response is not available to the attacker.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered by insufficient redirect handling when making requests using cURL.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to be able to initiate a request that could potentially trigger a redirect. No specific user privileges are mentioned, suggesting this could be possible with standard user access."
