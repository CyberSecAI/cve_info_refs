Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36630:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an improper handling of an error condition in the eAut module of RUCKUS SmartZone Controller.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper error handling leading to an amplified UDP response.
- Unauthenticated remote attacker can trigger the vulnerability.
- The vulnerable module sends a large UDP packet (5288 bytes).

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can perform a Denial-of-Service (DoS) attack against another network device.
- This is achieved through a reflective amplification attack where the vulnerable Ruckus device acts as the amplifier, sending a large UDP packet to the target.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a crafted request sent to the vulnerable eAut module of the RUCKUS SmartZone Controller.
- The attacker sends the request to port 9001 on the vulnerable device, which triggers the error condition and subsequent large UDP response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable RUCKUS SmartZone device.
- The attacker does not need authentication to exploit this vulnerability.
- The attacker needs the ability to send crafted UDP packets to the vulnerable device.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability affects RUCKUS SmartZone (both physical and virtual).
- Specifically affects versions 3.6.2 and earlier.
- The amplification factor is mentioned in the freebuf.com article, in the context of a similar Plex vulnerability, is approximately 3.77x if you consider the full packet, but can be considered as 12.9x if only looking at payload, the Ruckus advisory mentions 5288 bytes which seems much higher.
- A workaround is provided of blocking port 9001 on the firewall.
- The vulnerability was discovered and reported by Li-Xiang, a Baidu security researcher, and Borja Marcos from Sarenet.
