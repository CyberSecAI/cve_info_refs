# Critical Security Vulnerability Fixed In WP Reset PRO

[Security advisories](https://patchstack.com/category/security-advisories/)
[Vulnerability in WP Reset PRO](https://patchstack.com/tag/vulnerability-in-wp-reset-pro/)
Published 10 November 2021Updated 23 November 2023![](https://secure.gravatar.com/avatar/7f009046884a335084f86ff1a1acadce?s=200&d=mm&r=g)[Dave Jong](https://patchstack.com/author/davetheawesome/)CTO at PatchstackTable of Contents

*There was a critical security vulnerability in the WP Reset PRO plugin which allowed any authenticated user to wipe the database.*

**Do you want to be the first to be alerted about such vulnerabilities? [Sign up](http://patchstack.com/pricing/) for Patchstack Community (Free) plan and monitor up to 10 websites for free.**

**For plugin developers, we have [security audit services](https://patchstack.com/auditing/) and [Threat Intelligence Feed API](https://patchstack.com/threat-intel-feed/) for hosting companies.**

The PRO version of the [WP Reset plugin](https://wpreset.com/) (versions 5.98 and below) suffers from a vulnerability that allows any authenticated user, regardless of their authorization, to wipe the entire database.

Because it wipes all tables in the database, it will restart the WordPress installation process which could allow an attacker to launch this installation process and then create an administrator account at the end of this process as by default an administrator account has to be created once the WordPress site has been installed.

After this, they could further exploit the site by uploading a malicious plugin or uploading a backdoor.

![WP Reset PRO](https://ps.w.org/wp-reset/assets/banner-772x250.png?rev=2163880)

The plugin is described as a plugin that helps you to quickly reset the site’s database to the default installation values without modifying any files. It deletes all customizations and content or just chosen parts like theme settings.

The described issue was fixed in version 5.99 after a rapid response (within 24 hours!) by the developer team of the plugin in question.

### The security vulnerability in WP Reset PRO plugin

The issue in this plugin is caused due to a lack of authorization and nonce token check. The plugin registers a few actions in the *admin\_action\_\** scope. In the case of this vulnerability, it’s *admin\_action\_wpr\_delete\_snapshot\_tables*.

Unfortunately, the *admin\_action\_\** scope does not perform a check to determine if the user is authorized to perform said action, nor does it validate or check a nonce token to prevent CSRF attacks.

This action is registered as follows:

```
add_action('admin_action_wpr_delete_snapshot_tables', array($this, 'delete_snapshot_tables'));
```

The function delete\_snapshot\_tables looks like the following:

```
function delete_snapshot_tables($uid = '')
{
    global $wpdb;

    if (empty($uid)) {
        $uid = $_GET['uid'];
    }

    if (strlen($uid) != 4 && strlen($uid) != 6) {
        return new WP_Error(1, 'Invalid UID format.');
    }

    $tables = $wpdb->get_col($y = $wpdb->prepare('SHOW TABLES LIKE %s', array($uid . '\_%')));
    foreach ($tables as $table) {
        $wpdb->query('DROP TABLE IF EXISTS `' . $table . '`');
        if ($wpdb->last_error !== '') {
            $this->log('error', 'Failed to delete table ' . $table . ': ' . $wpdb->last_error);
        } else {
            $this->log('info', 'Deleted table ' . $table);
        }
    }

    if (!empty($_GET['redirect'])) {
        wp_safe_redirect($_GET['redirect']);
    }

    return true;
}
```

It can be seen that the *uid* query parameter is grabbed from the URL, which is directly used as a prefix of the tables that should be deleted. Since the LIKE operator is used, we can pass a query parameter such as *%%wp* to delete all tables with the prefix wp.

Once this is done, someone could simply visit the homepage of the site to start the WordPress installation process.

### The patch in WP Reset PRO

Since this is a premium plugin, the patch cannot be seen at the WordPress.org SVN repository.

Based on our own research and communication with the development team of the WP Reset PRO plugin, we can confirm that an authentication and authorization check has been added using the [current\_user\_can](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/current_user_can/) function, along with a check to determine if a valid nonce token is present in the request using the [check\_admin\_referer](https://developer.wordpress.org/reference/functions/check_admin_referer/) function.

In addition to this, the *uid* query parameter is also checked and made sure that it’s a string only containing letters using the [ctype\_alpha](https://www.php.net/manual/en/function.ctype-alpha.php) function.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
