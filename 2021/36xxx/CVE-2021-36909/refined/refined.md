Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper authorization and nonce token checks in the WP Reset PRO plugin. Specifically, the `admin_action_wpr_delete_snapshot_tables` action was registered without verifying if the user was authorized to perform the action or validating a nonce token to prevent CSRF attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Broken Access Control:** Any authenticated user, regardless of their role or permissions (including subscriber role), could trigger the database wipe functionality.
*   **Missing CSRF protection:** The absence of nonce token verification made the plugin vulnerable to Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Database Wipe:** An attacker could wipe the entire WordPress database, effectively resetting the site to its initial installation state.
*   **Site Takeover:** After wiping the database, the attacker could initiate the WordPress installation process and create a new administrator account, gaining full control over the site.
*  **Further Exploitation:** With administrator access, the attacker could then upload malicious plugins, backdoors, or otherwise compromise the site.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Request:**  The attacker could directly send a crafted request to the vulnerable `admin_action_wpr_delete_snapshot_tables` action with a malicious `uid` parameter.
*   **CSRF:** By tricking an authenticated user into clicking a malicious link, an attacker could trigger the database wipe.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needed to have an account on the WordPress site (even a subscriber-level account was sufficient).
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needed to be able to send HTTP requests to the WordPress site.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerable function `delete_snapshot_tables` takes a `uid` parameter from the URL, which is used as a prefix to determine which tables to delete using SQL LIKE operator. By providing a `uid` like `%%wp`, an attacker could delete all tables starting with `wp_`, including the core WordPress tables.
*   The vulnerability was fixed in version 5.99 by adding authentication and authorization checks using `current_user_can()` function and CSRF protection using `check_admin_referer()` function. Additionally, the `uid` parameter is sanitized to ensure it only contains letters using `ctype_alpha()`.
