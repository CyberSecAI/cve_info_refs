Data sheet

Product Overview
MONITORAPP AIWAF
The web is vulnerable. Because the HTTP/HTTPS ports must always be open to show the Web to clients, various attacks can be introduced through them. MONITORAPP’s web application firewall, AIWAF is specialized for traffic-based detection of hacking attempts using vulnerabilities in the Web and for controlling access to servers. Web attacks are evolving every day, causing malicious traffic or falsifying request information. Only WAF that does not stop ongoing development to respond to new types of web attacks can do the right thing. The answer is AIWAF in MONITORAPP.

![](https://www.monitorapp.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/06/기존이미지변경-AIWAF-서비스개요.png)

![aiwaf_01](/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/AIWAF_WAAP_EN.jpg)
Protect both Application and APIs
As the use of the cloud increases, security issues in web applications and APIs are emerging, and attacks targeting them are increasing.
MONTIORAPP’s web application firewall is evolving from a traditional web security platform to Web Application & API Protection (WAAP), which integrates API security, DDoS protection, and bot management. Secure your business assets against advanced cyber threats with a stronger MONITORAPP AIWAF.

**Defends fully any attack through the web.**

MONITORAPP's AIWAF performs Bot and DDoS mitigation, including OWASP Top10 vulnerabilities such as SQL Injection/XSS, through the best web application security technology. Adaptive Profiling Technolgy is a self-learning profiling technology that creates a profile DB by learning normal requests and responses of web servers as an automated security rule generation technology, and blocks transactions that violate the learning data at source. It also works with AILabs, a cyber threat intelligence platform, to proactively respond to unknown threats and zero-day attacks.

![AIWAF description ](/images/products/cont_bg_waf_02.jpg)

**Enjoy the best performance without slowing down your web services**
AIWAF's transparent proxy technology is implemented as a proxy type without changing the existing network configuration.
High-performance packet processing and load balancing algorithms maximize the performance of high-capacity traffic. It has SSL traffic handling, but it automatically scans non HTTP traffic, bypasses, and accelerates through Web caching to ensure maximum performance without sacrificing speed. Fail-open and fail-over features for non-disruptive delivery of Web services, and automatic by-pass function ensure web service availability in the event of a web service failure due to performance limits.

▲ AIWAF function process flow

**Provides intuitive UI and detailed dashboards**.

AIWAF UI is designed to be intuitive and easy to manage for security personnel. User satisfaction is maximized with a convenient interface, intuitive controls, visible reports of attacks and traffic, and monitoring of web server service health.

![abstract photo of lines](/images/products/cont_bg_waf_04.jpg)

![AIWAF function process flow](/images/products/cont_bg_waf_05.jpg)

**More convenient.**

Multi-domain management allows multiple security officers to create independent and different security policies for their assigned domains.
Setting security policies and contents related to system operation, such as dashboards and reports, are also provided independently.

**AIWAF, the leading choice of over 4000 organisations**

AIWAF is a solution that has secured various references from more than 4000 public institutions, financial institutions, and general companies around the world. As the number one web firewall market share solution in Korea, we have verified performance and functionality through numerous BMTs and PoCs, and are expanding our customer base by supplying to tier 1 financial institutions, cryptocurrency exchanges, and large public institutions.
