- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A flaw within a CODESYS EtherNet/IP adapter protocol stack library causes a null pointer dereference in the generated code. This vulnerable protocol stack is downloaded to and executed by CODESYS Control runtime systems when configured as EtherNet/IP adapters.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference. Specific EtherNet/IP requests can trigger the null pointer dereference.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A null pointer dereference may cause a denial-of-service condition in the CODESYS Control runtime system.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending specific EtherNet/IP requests.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker with low skills can exploit this vulnerability. No specific position within the network is mentioned, but the attacker needs to be able to send crafted EtherNet/IP requests.
