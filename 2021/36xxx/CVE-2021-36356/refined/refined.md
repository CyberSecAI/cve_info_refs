- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application allows writing arbitrary content to any path writable by the `www-data` user by sending a crafted request to `/ajaxPages/writeBrowseFilePathAjax.php`. This is a re-emergence of a previously patched vulnerability (CVE-2019-17124).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper input validation allowing arbitrary file writes.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution by writing malicious PHP files to the web root.
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a crafted request to `/ajaxPages/writeBrowseFilePathAjax.php`.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint. No authentication is required.
