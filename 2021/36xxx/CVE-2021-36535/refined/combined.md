| so, the problem seems to be in allowing unary `--` on `print`. minimum repro is:  ``` --print; print(1);  ```  this segfaults in mjs\_builtin call, presumably `print` having been corrupted by `--`. [@cpq](https://github.com/cpq) maybe you can help with adding validation so `print` doesn't actually get tampered with?  not sure what the correct behavior should be here, fwiw if you `--` a function in V8 it disappears from the namespace. |

| How do you fuzz js code? how do you mutate and generate valid js code?  It's compiled by afl-gcc and processed by afl. Generating the the valid js code is not the point, the flaw causes a denial-of-service (and potentially code execution) due to a heap buffer overflow which can be triggered via a crafted js file. |

| You are telling me that the crashing poc .js file is generated by AFL? I thought it's some grammer fuzzing or something like that |
