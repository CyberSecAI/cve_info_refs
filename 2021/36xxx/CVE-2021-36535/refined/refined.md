Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a heap-based buffer overflow in the `mjs_set_errorf` function, specifically at line 7617 of `mjs.c`. The issue stems from allowing the unary `--` operator to be applied to the `print` function, which leads to memory corruption.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow.
- Improper handling of unary operators on built-in functions.
- Lack of input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of service.
- Potential for code execution. (Mentioned by the reporter, but not confirmed in the provided data.)
- Memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**
- Crafted JavaScript code executed by the `mjs` interpreter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable mjs interpreter.
- No special privileges are mentioned as required.
- Ability to provide a crafted .js file as input to the mjs interpreter.
- The vulnerable code exists within the `mjs` project.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue is triggered by using the unary `--` operator on the built-in `print` function. Specifically, the code `--print; print(1);` demonstrates the vulnerability, and will segfault in `mjs_builtin` call, presumably `print` having been corrupted by `--`.
- The vulnerability was found by using AddressSanitizer during fuzzing of the interpreter.
- A minimal PoC file (`Heap_Buffer_Overflow.js.tar.gz`) is provided.
- The vulnerability is located in `mjs.c:7617`, inside the `mjs_set_errorf` function.
- The call stack leading to the vulnerability includes several parser functions.
