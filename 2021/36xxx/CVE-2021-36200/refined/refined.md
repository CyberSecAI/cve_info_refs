Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36200:

**CVE-2021-36200**

* **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of authentication checks in the Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS web API. This means that a user can bypass the normal login procedure and gain unauthorized access to the API.
* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary weakness is the "Missing Authentication for Critical Function" (CWE-306). This allows an attacker to access the API without proper verification of their identity.
* **Impact of Exploitation:** An unauthenticated attacker can access the Metasys web API and enumerate users. This could allow the attacker to gather sensitive information about the system.
* **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is network-based and can be exploited remotely with low complexity. An attacker would need network access to the vulnerable Metasys system.
* **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the Metasys ADS/ADX/OAS system. They don't need any prior authentication credentials.

**Additional Details:**

*   **Affected Products:** The vulnerability affects Johnson Controls Metasys ADS, ADX, and OAS with MUI versions 10 and 11.
*   **Mitigation:** Johnson Controls recommends applying specific patches: 10.1.6 for version 10 and 11.0.2 for version 11. The advisory ([JCI-PSA-2022-04](https://www.johnsoncontrols.com/cyber-solutions/security-advisories)) provides additional details.
*   **CISA Recommendations:** In addition to patching, CISA recommends minimizing network exposure, isolating control system networks, and using secure remote access methods like VPNs.
