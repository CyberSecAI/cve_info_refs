Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to "Unsynchronized Access to Shared Data in a Multithreaded Context" within the SMB Continuous Availability (CA) handling of Dell PowerScale OneFS.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- The core issue is a lack of proper synchronization when multiple threads access shared data related to SMB CA functionality. This can lead to race conditions and inconsistent states.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition over SMB.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based, specifically through the SMB protocol.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of SMB on a cluster where CA is enabled.

**Summary:**

The vulnerability lies in improper handling of shared data within a multithreaded context related to SMB Continuous Availability (CA) in Dell PowerScale OneFS. An authenticated attacker leveraging SMB can cause a denial of service, impacting SMB operations. A workaround is provided of disabling SMB CA.
