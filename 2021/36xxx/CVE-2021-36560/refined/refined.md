Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36560:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper access control in the admin panel of an online SMS system. The application does not properly restrict access to the `dashboard.php` page, allowing unauthenticated users to bypass the login page.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Authentication Bypass:** The primary weakness is the ability to bypass the login mechanism and directly access the admin dashboard without valid credentials.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** The `dashboard.php` page is accessible without authentication. The application does not verify if a user has logged in before granting access to the admin area.
*   **Exposed Sensitive Page:** The `exlogin.php` file is exposed in the source code, allowing attackers to identify the page to bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Attackers can gain complete access to the admin panel without needing to provide credentials.
*   **Data Manipulation:** Once inside the admin panel, attackers could potentially view, modify, or delete sensitive data related to SMS messages, users, or system configurations.
*   **Service Disruption:** Attackers could disrupt the normal functionality of the system by making unauthorized changes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct URL Access:** An attacker can directly access the vulnerable `dashboard.php` page via the URL.
*   **Directory Brute-forcing:** An attacker can use tools to discover the `dashboard.php` page.
*   **Source Code Analysis:** An attacker can examine the HTML source code to reveal the `exlogin.php` and eventually the `dashboard.php` page path.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to reach the vulnerable system.
*   **Basic Web Knowledge:** Knowledge of web browsing, HTML, and using a tool like a directory brute-forcer, or simply examining the source code.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerable version of the application is 1.0.
*   The vendor's homepage is `www.sourcecodester.com`.
*   The provided content highlights that the vulnerability can be discovered both with and without the use of automated tools.

This information is consistent with a typical authentication bypass vulnerability.
