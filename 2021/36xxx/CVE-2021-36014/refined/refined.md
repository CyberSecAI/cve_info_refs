Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-36014:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Improper Input Validation (CWE-20)

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The software fails to properly validate user-supplied input, leading to an arbitrary file system read.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can potentially read arbitrary files from the file system.

**Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L), with a low attack complexity (AC:L). The attack requires user interaction (UI:R) as the user needs to open a malicious file to trigger the vulnerability. The scope of the attack is unchanged (S:U).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs local access and the ability to convince a user to open a crafted file. No special privileges are required (PR:N)
