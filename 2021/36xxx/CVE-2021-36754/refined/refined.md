Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36754:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by a specific DNS query with QTYPE 65535. The PowerDNS Authoritative Server 4.5.0 does not handle this query type correctly, leading to an uncaught out-of-bounds exception.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
-  **Out-of-bounds exception:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper handling of the QTYPE 65535 query, resulting in an uncaught out-of-bounds exception when processing the packet.
- **Lack of input validation:** The code does not properly validate the QTYPE field in the DNS query, which allows the attacker to trigger the exception.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is a denial of service as the PowerDNS Authoritative Server crashes due to the uncaught exception. While the system may automatically restart if run under a supervisor (like systemd or supervisord), this still results in service degradation.
- **No system compromise:** The advisory explicitly states that there is no risk of system compromise beyond the DoS.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-based attack:** The vulnerability is triggered through a crafted DNS query packet sent to the affected PowerDNS Authoritative Server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send DNS queries to the vulnerable PowerDNS Authoritative Server.
- **Crafting DNS packets:** The attacker must have the ability to create and send a DNS query packet with QTYPE 65535.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected version: PowerDNS Authoritative Server version 4.5.0 and pre-releases (alpha/beta/rc1/rc2).
- Not affected versions: 4.4.x and below, and 4.5.1.
- Mitigation: Upgrade to version 4.5.1 or implement a filter in `dnsdist` to block queries with QTYPE 65535.
- The vulnerability was found in production by Reinier Schoof and Robin Geuze of TransIP, who reported it to the developers.
