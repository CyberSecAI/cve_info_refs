Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-36981:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Insecure Java deserialization of untrusted data in the SerNet verinice server. The application uses `ObjectInputStream` to deserialize data received from the client, without proper validation or filtering, making it vulnerable to exploitation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **CWE-502: Deserialization of Untrusted Data:** The core issue is the lack of proper validation of the data being deserialized. The application does not ensure that the incoming serialized data is safe, allowing an attacker to inject malicious objects.
*   **Insecure Communication:** The server relies on serialized Java objects for communication with the client, which is inherently risky due to the potential for deserialization attacks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server with the privileges of the verinice server process. This includes the ability to:
    *   Access and modify files on the server.
    *   Exfiltrate sensitive data, including data stored in the verinice database.
    *   Compromise the entire server.
*   **Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF):** Initially, an attacker may achieve SSRF by exploiting the deserialization vulnerability to make requests to internal resources. This can be a stepping stone to full RCE.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The vulnerability is accessible over the network via the HTTP(S) protocol. Specifically, the vulnerable endpoints are `/veriniceserver/service/commandServiceHttpInvoker`, `authServiceHttpInvoker`, `taskServiceHttpInvoker`, and `processServiceHttpInvoker`.
*   **Serialized Java Objects:** The attack involves crafting malicious serialized Java objects which are then sent to the vulnerable endpoints.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authentication:** The attacker needs to have valid login credentials for the verinice application to successfully exploit the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must have network connectivity to the server's HTTP(S) port (typically 80, 443, 8080 or 8443).
*   **Knowledge of Gadgets:**  Exploitation requires leveraging known Java deserialization gadgets, such as those found in Ysoserial. The exploit can be achieved using the C3P0, FileUpload1 and URLDNS gadgets.
*   **Rogue JNDI Server (for RCE):** To achieve full remote code execution using C3P0, the attacker needs to host a rogue JNDI server to serve a malicious Java class.

**Additional Technical Details:**

*   The vulnerability exists in the `org.springframework.remoting.httpinvoker.HttpInvokerServiceExporter` class, which uses `ObjectInputStream` for deserialization.
*   The `HttpInvokerServiceExporter` is present in `/WEB-INF//lib/spring-web/org/springframework/remoting/httpinvoker/HttpInvokerServiceExporter.java`.
*   The vulnerable method is `readRemoteInvocation` which calls `doReadRemoteInvocation` which finally calls `ois.readObject()`.
*   The vulnerability impacts all endpoints using `ObjectInputStream / readObject()`.
*   The vendor recommends using a different message format like JSON instead of Java serialization for communication between services.

**Mitigation:**

*   The vendor released version 1.22.2 of verinice to patch the deserialization vulnerability. Users of verinice and verinice.PRO should upgrade to this version or later.
*   The patch addresses the vulnerability by implementing a class deserialization filter.
*   It is also noted that even the standalone client of verinice may be vulnerable to local exploitation using the same attack vector.
