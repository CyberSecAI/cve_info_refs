  "vulnerability": {
    "cve_id": "CVE-2021-36977",
    "description": "matio (aka MAT File I/O Library) 1.5.20 and 1.5.21 has a heap-based buffer overflow in H5MM_memcpy (called from H5MM_malloc and H5C_load_entry).",
    "affected_versions": [
      "1.5.20",
      "1.5.21"
     ],
    "root_cause": "Heap-based buffer overflow in the H5MM_memcpy function of the libhdf5 library, a dependency of matio.",
    "vulnerabilities": [
      "Heap-based buffer overflow"
    ],
    "impact": "The vulnerability could lead to a crash or potentially arbitrary code execution if exploited.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Processing a specially crafted MAT file"
    ],
   "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker would need to be able to supply a malicious MAT file to an application using the vulnerable matio library.",
    "additional_details": "The vulnerability was fixed by updating the libhdf5 dependency from version 1.12.0 to 1.12.1. The vulnerability was triggered by a heap-buffer-overflow write of 4 bytes during the H5MM_memcpy call."
