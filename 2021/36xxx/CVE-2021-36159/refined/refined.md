Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36159:

**Verification:**

The content from `github.com_9192263c_20250115_093446.html` includes a commit message: "Fix libfetch out of bounds read. Approved by: so Security: SA-21:15.libfetch Security: CVE-2021-36159". This confirms that the provided content is related to the specified CVE. The content from `gitlab.alpinelinux.org_e6d541e2_20250115_093446.html` provides detailed technical information on the vulnerability.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `libfetch` library's handling of FTP passive mode responses. Specifically, when parsing the server-provided address and port information in the PORT command, the code does not properly validate the end of the string. The code uses `strtol` to parse numerical values, and the loop condition checks for null termination (`\0`) after the `p++` operation, leading to an out-of-bounds read if the string ends prematurely. Also, the code does not perform proper bounds checking before multiplying values when parsing numbers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds read: The code reads beyond the allocated buffer when parsing the server's address information due to improper loop termination.
- Integer Overflow: The code lacks proper checks to prevent integer overflows while calculating sizes in multiple functions such as when parsing the port number in the `fetch.c`, size in `ftp.c`, chunk size in `http.c` and content length in `http.c`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Information Leak: A malicious FTP server can control the connection buffer size by sending a specially crafted response, potentially leading to the exposure of sensitive memory contents when parsing the address in the FTP passive mode. This information can then be exfiltrated by setting a new connection using the crafted port number or address.
- Denial of Service: A crafted response can cause the parsing to go out-of-bounds, which can lead to a crash, resulting in a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious FTP Server: An attacker can set up a malicious FTP server that sends crafted responses to exploit the vulnerability.
- Man-in-the-Middle: An attacker could intercept and modify responses from a legitimate FTP server to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Ability to control an FTP server or the communication channel between the client and server.
- The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted response that triggers the out-of-bounds read when using the passive mode.

**Additional Notes:**

- The commit message "Fix libfetch out of bounds read" suggests a patch has been applied to address this vulnerability.
- The provided code diffs show the fixes applied, including checks for prematurely ending strings, and overflow checks during parsing.
- The analysis identifies two distinct types of vulnerabilities: out-of-bounds read in `ftp.c` and multiple integer overflows in `fetch.c`, `ftp.c` and `http.c`,
