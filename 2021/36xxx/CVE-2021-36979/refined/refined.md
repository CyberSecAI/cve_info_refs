Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-36979:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is an out-of-bounds write error within the `tb_flush_armeb` function of the Unicorn emulator.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Out-of-bounds write vulnerability. This implies that the software is attempting to write data outside of the allocated memory region, leading to memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The impact of the out-of-bounds write is described as an "UNKNOWN WRITE", which may indicate the possibility of arbitrary code execution, denial-of-service, or other undefined behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the execution of ARM code emulation, specifically within the `tb_flush_armeb`, `cpu_arm_exec_armeb`, and `tcg_cpu_exec_armeb` functions. 
- The specific input or condition that triggers the vulnerability involves a particular sequence or configuration of ARM instructions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to supply a specially crafted sequence of ARM instructions that, when emulated by Unicorn, causes the out-of-bounds write.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found by OSS-Fuzz.
- The vulnerability was introduced in commit `8b659c61b2dad88e55a0f1af6f725be6bce782bd` and fixed in commit `bf1713d9e011b55ca1f502a6779fc4722b4bb077`.
- The vulnerable versions include 1.0.2, 1.0.2-rc1, 1.0.2-rc2, 1.0.2-rc3, 1.0.2-rc4, 1.0.2-rc5, and 1.0.2-rc6.
- The vulnerability is considered a HIGH severity issue.
- A patch was released in version 1.0.3 which addresses the vulnerability
