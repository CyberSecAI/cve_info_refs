- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The 1Password Connect server does not properly validate input when consuming Secrets Automation tokens.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Insufficient input validation leading to authorization bypass.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A user with permission to create Secrets Automation tokens can create tokens with access to any vaults configured for access by the Secrets Automation, bypassing intended restrictions.  They can also set arbitrary attributes, such as expiry dates.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack requires manual creation of tokens, not offered by the standard web app or command-line tool, by a user with the ability to create tokens in the Secrets Automation environment.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker must have permission to create Secrets Automation tokens.
