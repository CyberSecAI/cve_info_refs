| **Describe the bug** A dividing by zero error in lib/extras/codec\_apng.cc:283 jxl::DecodeImageAPNG(), the `delay_den` can be 0 resulting in an Arithmetic Exception.  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior:  ``` $ CC=clang CXX=clang++ CFLAGS="-g" CXXFLAGS="-g" cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release -DBUILD_TESTING=OFF  .. $ cmake --build . -- -j 8 $ tools/cjxl ./crash.png /tmp/tmp.jxl ```  The crash file [crash.png](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/22651256/125076810-f14d1400-e0f2-11eb-9d09-0b855288738e.png).  **Expected behavior** cjxl should encode the PNG to JXL successfully.  **Environment**   * OS: 5.8.0-59-generic 20.04.1-Ubuntu * Compiler version: clang version 7.0.1-12 * CPU type: x86\_64 * cjxl/djxl version string: cjxl v0.3.7 [AVX2,SSE4,Scalar]   **Additional context**  ``` # build without ASAN $ ./cjxl ./crash.png /tmp/tmp.jxl JPEG XL encoder v0.3.7 [AVX2,SSE4,Scalar] [1]    1597419 floating point exception  ./cjxl ./crash.png /tmp/tmp.jxl ``` |

| There seems to be a bug with ASAN... the report of ASAN is misleading ...Try to reproduce without ASAN? The cause of this crash looks like a division by zero error in `lib/extras/codec_apng.cc:283 jxl::DecodeImageAPNG()`  ``` ...  280           if (hasInfo) {   281             if (!processing_finish(png_ptr, info_ptr)) {  282               ImageBundle bundle(&io->metadata.m); *283               bundle.duration = delay_num * 1000 / delay_den;  284               bundle.origin.x0 = x0;  285               bundle.origin.y0 = y0; ... ```  `delay_den` can be 0 according to [this wiki](https://wiki.mozilla.org/APNG_Specification).  The `delay_num` and `delay_den` parameters together specify a fraction indicating the time to display the current frame, in seconds. If the denominator is 0, it is to be treated as if it were 100 (that is, `delay_num` then specifies 1/100ths of a second).  so the `delay_den` maybe need to be checked?  **some debugging infomation from gdb**  ``` gdb-peda$ p delay_den $2 = 0x0 gdb-peda$ n Thread 1 "cjxl" received signal SIGFPE, Arithmetic exception.
