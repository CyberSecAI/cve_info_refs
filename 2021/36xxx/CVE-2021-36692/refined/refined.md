Based on the provided information, this content is relevant to CVE-2021-36692.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a division-by-zero error in the `jxl::DecodeImageAPNG()` function within the libjxl library when handling APNG (Animated Portable Network Graphics) files. Specifically, the `delay_den` value, which is part of the APNG frame timing data, can be zero, leading to a division-by-zero when calculating the frame duration.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Division-by-zero error: The code does not properly check if `delay_den` is zero before performing the division: `bundle.duration = delay_num * 1000 / delay_den;`

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Application crash: The division-by-zero leads to an Arithmetic Exception (SIGFPE), causing the application using the libjxl library (specifically the cjxl tool) to crash. This can cause a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- Malicious APNG file: An attacker can craft an APNG file where the `delay_den` value is set to zero. When this file is processed by the vulnerable code, it will trigger the division-by-zero error.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to provide a specially crafted APNG image file to the cjxl tool.

**Additional Details:**
- The issue was initially misidentified as a compiler/ASAN bug but was later confirmed to be a division-by-zero error.
- The fix implemented checks if delay_den is zero and defaults it to 100 in such cases: `if (!delay_den) delay_den = 100;`
- The vulnerability was reported by `aug5t7` and fixed by `cagelight` in commit `7dfa400ded53919d986c5d3d23446a09e0cf481b`. The fix is associated with pull request #313.
