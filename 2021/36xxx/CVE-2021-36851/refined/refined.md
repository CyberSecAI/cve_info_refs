**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-36851

**Root Cause:** The WordPress Testimonial Slider plugin, versions 3.5.8.4 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The specific vulnerable code is not detailed in the provided content.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin allows for the injection of malicious scripts into the website.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   A successful XSS attack could allow a malicious actor to inject scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into the website. These scripts would then execute when users visit the compromised site.

*   The attack vector is through the plugin's functionalities, where user-supplied input is not properly sanitized or escaped before being rendered on the website. The exact location of the vulnerability is not provided, but it likely involves user inputs being used in a manner that allows for injecting code.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   An attacker would need to be able to inject malicious code through the plugin's interface. It is mentioned that the required privilege is an 'Editor', implying the attacker needs access to WordPress's backend with this level of permission to insert malicious script.
* The attacker may also be able to exploit the vulnerability through the front-end submission form if the vulnerability is not isolated to the backend interface.
