# Dell Networking X1000 Series, Firmware v3.0.1.9

Restart required AUTO INSTALLED This file was automatically installed as part of a recent update. If you are experiencing any issues, you can manually download and reinstall.  **This file was automatically installed as part of a recent update. If you are experiencing any issues, you can manually download and reinstall.**   This firmware release is for the Dell Networking X1000 series switches and includes image file, boot code file, Release Notes, MIBs, and User Documentation.

Administrators upgrading Dell Networking X1008, X1008P, X1018, X1018P, X1026, X1026P, X1052, X1052P switches to firmware-image version 3.0.1.9 and Boot-code/PROM version 1.0.0.25 MUST follow the upgrade instructions documented in the “X10xx\_X4012\_CLI\_Software\_Upgrade\_Instructions.pdf" procedure. Failure to follow the procedures described in that document when upgrading firmware may result in an inoperable switch!

The relevant X10xx series switches will automatically update CPLD to the latest version (X1018/P: Rev07/2.07, X1026/P: Rev08/2.08, X1052/P HW version 00.00.04 and later: Rev0B/2.13) on boot up if switches are running with older CPLD version. CPLD update will take at least 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Power cycling the switch during the CPLD update is likely to cause the switch to become inoperable and require the switches to be RMA’ed for factory re-installation of the firmware.

CPLD code will not be updated automatically for X1052/P HW version 00.00.03 and older switches. After upgrading X1052/P HW version 00.00.03 and older switches to firmware version to 3.0.1.9 and boot-code version to 1.0.0.25, the CPLD can be updated manually from boot-menu by pressing “Esc” button on switch boot-up (and selecting the option “[3]-CPLD Upgrade Force”). Please contact our technical support for more details and guidance.Recommended

# Dell Networking X1000 Series, Firmware v3.0.1.9

Restart required AUTO INSTALLED This file was automatically installed as part of a recent update. If you are experiencing any issues, you can manually download and reinstall.  **This file was automatically installed as part of a recent update. If you are experiencing any issues, you can manually download and reinstall.**   This firmware release is for the Dell Networking X1000 series switches and includes image file, boot code file, Release Notes, MIBs, and User Documentation.

Administrators upgrading Dell Networking X1008, X1008P, X1018, X1018P, X1026, X1026P, X1052, X1052P switches to firmware-image version 3.0.1.9 and Boot-code/PROM version 1.0.0.25 MUST follow the upgrade instructions documented in the “X10xx\_X4012\_CLI\_Software\_Upgrade\_Instructions.pdf" procedure. Failure to follow the procedures described in that document when upgrading firmware may result in an inoperable switch!

The relevant X10xx series switches will automatically update CPLD to the latest version (X1018/P: Rev07/2.07, X1026/P: Rev08/2.08, X1052/P HW version 00.00.04 and later: Rev0B/2.13) on boot up if switches are running with older CPLD version. CPLD update will take at least 10 to 15 minutes to complete. Power cycling the switch during the CPLD update is likely to cause the switch to become inoperable and require the switches to be RMA’ed for factory re-installation of the firmware.

CPLD code will not be updated automatically for X1052/P HW version 00.00.03 and older switches. After upgrading X1052/P HW version 00.00.03 and older switches to firmware version to 3.0.1.9 and boot-code version to 1.0.0.25, the CPLD can be updated manually from boot-menu by pressing “Esc” button on switch boot-up (and selecting the option “[3]-CPLD Upgrade Force”). Please contact our technical support for more details and guidance.Recommended
