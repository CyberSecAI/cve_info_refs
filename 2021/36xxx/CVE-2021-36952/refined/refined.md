{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Crafted data in a DDS file can trigger an overflow of a heap-based buffer.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability within the parsing of DDS files.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Remote attackers can execute arbitrary code in the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file containing the crafted DDS data.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to create a malicious DDS file or a web page that causes the vulnerable application to process the crafted DDS data. User interaction is required (opening a malicious file or visiting a malicious page)."
