# xrdp contains default keys generated at build-time

```
Hi maxice8,

Package xrdp in Alpine contains private key. Same key for every system using that package, compromised by publishing package.
Please consider rebuilding package excluding keys contained in files /etc/xrdp/key.pem, /etc/xrdp/cert.pem, /etc/rsakeys.ini.

I'm writing to you as mails sent to Alan are rejected, and you were updating package most recently.
I found issue when xrdp was proposed for Void.

Regards,
[REDACTED]
```

I wonder if we should move the process to `.post-install` so a different key is generated in every install.

@kaniini tagging you since I can't find a `@team/security`, if possible assign to the appropriate party.

To upload designs, you'll need to enable LFS and have an admin enable hashed storage. [More information](/help/user/project/issues/design_management.md#prerequisites)
