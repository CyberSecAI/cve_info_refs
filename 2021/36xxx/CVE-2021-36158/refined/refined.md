- Root cause of vulnerability: The `xrdp` package in Alpine Linux contains default, pre-generated private keys that are identical across all installations of the package. These keys are located in `/etc/xrdp/key.pem`, `/etc/xrdp/cert.pem`, and `/etc/rsakeys.ini`.
- Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present: Use of hardcoded, identical keys across multiple installations of a package.
- Impact of exploitation: An attacker who obtains these keys can potentially impersonate the server and decrypt communication with systems that use the vulnerable package.
- Attack vectors: An attacker could potentially gain access to the private keys by extracting them from the published package.
- Required attacker capabilities/position: The attacker needs to be able to obtain the compromised default keys, either from the published package itself, or another system using the vulnerable package.
