## Description

Automatically gives your media files and their details ‚Äî Title, ALT Text, and Description ‚Äî a new, better name, for SEO and tidiness. It‚Äôs smart enough to offer suggestions using various methods, including AI, and lets you make changes manually too.

Whether you‚Äôre uploading new files or want to update your whole media library at once, this plugin makes it easy and does a lot of the work for you.

Your WordPress becomes cleaner, more organized, and more efficient. Please visit the official website for more information: Media File Renamer.

### Compatibility

Media File Renamer is compatible with a wide range of WordPress features and plugins, including support for Retina and WebP images, re-scaled images from WP 5.3 onwards, PDF Thumbnails, UTF8 files, and optimized images. It‚Äôs designed to handle various encoding types, ensuring your media library is always organized. Some page builders like Avia Layout Builder may limit renaming due to encryption.

### Pro Version

In the [Pro Version](https://meowapps.com/media-file-renamer/), you‚Äôll find many exciting features, like AI Vision and Suggestions for smart renaming, and anonymize your files for extra privacy. Easily move files across directories in bulk, sync metadata such as ALT texts and titles, and even number your files for better organization.

### Important

Renaming or moving files can be risky, so it‚Äôs vital to take precautions and make a backup before using Media File Renamer. Start by renaming files individually to ensure page references update correctly, as some plugins might interfere with the process. If issues arise post-renaming, try clearing your cache to fix outdated references. Still facing problems? Utilize the Undo feature to revert filenames. For further assistance or to explore more solutions, visit our [Questions & Issues](https://meowapps.com/media-file-renamer/issues/) support page.

### A Simpler Plugin

If you only need an simple field in order to modify the filename, you can also try [Phoenix Media Rename](https://wordpress.org/plugins/phoenix-media-rename). It‚Äôs simpler, and just does that. Yes, we are friends!

Je recommande vraiment Media File Renamer ! L‚Äôinterface est super simple √† utiliser et le param√©trage est un jeu d‚Äôenfant. En plus, j‚Äôutilise d√©j√† plusieurs plugins de l‚Äôauteur et je les trouve tous vraiment pratiques, surtout pour tout ce qui est gestion des images. Si vous avez besoin de mieux organiser vos fichiers sur WordPress, foncez, c‚Äôest top !

### [Best renaming tool ever!](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/best-renaming-tool-ever/)

I had the plan to re-organize my whole WP media library containing around 700 images linked to pages and posts. After having tried our other PRO tools like Media Library Tools and Image Attribution, I switched to Media File Renamer, and it went perfectly. Plus, they have a support which really reacts to your specific needs (in my case, I just wanted to use the first 4 words of the title as file name).File renaming is a delicate thing in WordPress, and it can completely ruin your previous efforts, so I can recommend anyone to use this tool.

I first installed the Media File Renamer only as a handler for the Real Physical Media add-on of the Real Media Library plugin. It works perfectly there ‚Äì invisible, seamless and smooth. But in the meantime, I am also an enthusiastic user of the clear File Renamer Dashboard, where the files in the Media Library can be renamed automatically or manually in the easiest and fastest way, including a reliable undo function. And all this for free ‚Äì thank you for this extremly useful plugin!
Forgot to mention: The support is also fantastic!

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
