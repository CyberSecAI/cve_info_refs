Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information for CVE-2021-36395:

**Root Cause:**

- The file repository's URL parsing lacked sufficient recursion handling. This allowed for a potential recursion denial-of-service.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Recursive cURL:** The vulnerability stems from the way the file repository handles URLs, specifically with recursive cURL calls. This could lead to a denial-of-service if a malicious actor can craft URLs that force the system into an infinite recursive loop.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability would result in a denial of service, making the affected Moodle instance unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Maliciously crafted URLs:** The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted URL to the file repository that causes a recursive loop with cURL.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs the ability to submit URLs to the file repository. The provided text doesn't specify specific requirements such as authentication or specific roles to trigger the issue.

**Additional Information:**

- **Affected Versions:** Moodle versions 3.11, 3.10 to 3.10.4, 3.9 to 3.9.7 and earlier unsupported versions are affected.
