The provided content discusses a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability found in Feehi CMS, related to image uploads.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of the filename during image upload.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - Specifically, a Stored XSS vulnerability, as the malicious payload is stored in the database/file system.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the application by crafting a specific filename for the uploaded image. This JavaScript code will then be executed in the browsers of other users when they view the page where this image is displayed, potentially leading to:
*   Account hijacking
*   Data theft
*   Malware distribution
*   Defacement of the website

**Attack vectors:**
*   Image upload functionality in the text editor within the Feehi CMS application.
*   Malicious filename crafted to inject JavaScript. For example, a filename like `">.jpg`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Attacker needs to be authenticated/have access to a user account with the ability to upload images to the CMS.
*   The attacker needs to be able to access the image upload feature of the CMS.
