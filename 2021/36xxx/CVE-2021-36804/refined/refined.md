Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36804:

**Vulnerability:** CVE-2021-36804 - Akaunting Weak Password Reset

*   **Root Cause:** The application uses the Host header to generate the password reset link, allowing an attacker to manipulate the host by modifying the Host header during a password reset request.
*   **Weakness:** The application does not properly validate or sanitize the Host header when constructing password reset URLs. It directly uses the provided Host header, which allows an attacker to inject a malicious domain.
*  **Impact:** An attacker can initiate a password reset for a valid user and, by controlling the reset link, redirect the user to a malicious site. This allows the attacker to capture the reset token and subsequently gain unauthorized access to the user's account by setting a new password. This is essentially a password reset relay attack.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a POST request to the `/auth/forgot` endpoint with a modified Host header.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to know or be able to guess a valid email address registered within the application. They also need to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests to change the Host header. The attacker does not need to be authenticated to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability arises from a design choice in the Laravel framework, which Akaunting is built on, and how it handles proxy headers in multi-tenant implementations.
*  The fix for this vulnerability was included in Akaunting v2.1.13.
