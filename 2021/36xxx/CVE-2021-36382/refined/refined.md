The provided content directly relates to CVE-2021-36382.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Private keys are returned unencrypted by the `connections/partial` endpoint.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the unencrypted transmission of private keys through the API endpoint. This could lead to data exposure.
- **Impact of exploitation:** If TLS is not enabled and the private keys are exposed, an attacker could gain unauthorized access to systems and data protected by those keys.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by intercepting the unencrypted communication between the client and server when accessing the `connections/partial` endpoint. This requires being on the network or able to eavesdrop on traffic.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be in a position to intercept network traffic or have access to a network where the unencrypted communication between the client and server occurs when using the vulnerable API endpoint. The attack is classified as 'Adjacent', and user interaction is required, which indicates that an attacker would need to initiate the request to exploit this vulnerability.
