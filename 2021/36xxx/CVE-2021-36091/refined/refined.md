Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36091:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper permission checks when accessing calendar appointments.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** Agents can list calendar appointments even without the necessary permissions. This indicates an insufficient access control mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** Unauthorized agents can view calendar appointments, potentially exposing sensitive scheduling information.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network Access:** An attacker (agent) can exploit this vulnerability through the OTRS web interface, given they have valid agent login credentials.
- **User Interaction:** While the attacker needs to be logged in as an agent, no further user interaction is required.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Authentication:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in agent within the OTRS system.
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the OTRS system.
- **Low Privileges:** The attacker can exploit the vulnerability even with potentially limited permissions (as long as they are a logged-in agent)
