{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is caused by an unbounded recursion in the strict blocking feature of uBlock Origin due to arbitrary depth of parameter nesting.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Unbounded recursion leading to a denial of service (DoS).",
  "Impact of exploitation": "A crafted web site can cause a denial of service by triggering unbounded recursion, leading to high memory consumption and loss of blocking functionality in uBlock Origin. This leaves users vulnerable to ads, malware and trackers until the extension is reloaded.",
  "Attack vectors": "Crafted web sites exploiting the arbitrary depth of parameter nesting for strict blocking.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to craft a malicious web page with specific URL structures that trigger the vulnerability.",
  "Additional details": "The vulnerability also affects uMatrix, and potentially other forks of these extensions that share similar code. The issue has been fixed in uBlock Origin and uMatrix."
