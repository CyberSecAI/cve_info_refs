# Failure to properly sanitize credentials in cluster template answers

Critical

[rmweir](/rmweir)
published
GHSA-8w87-58w6-hfv8
Aug 19, 2022

## Package

gomod

rancher/rancher
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

From 2.5.0 and 2.6.0 up to and including 2.5.12 and 2.6.3

## Patched versions

2.5.13, 2.6.4 and later releases

## Description

### Impact

It was discovered that in Rancher versions up to and including 2.5.12 and 2.6.3 there is a failure to properly sanitize credentials in cluster template answers. This failure can lead to plaintext storage and exposure of credentials, passwords and API tokens.

The exposed credentials are visible in Rancher to authenticated `Cluster Owners`, `Cluster Members`, `Project Owners` and `Project Members` on the endpoints `/v1/management.cattle.io.clusters`, `/v3/clusters` and `/k8s/clusters/local/apis/management.cattle.io/v3/clusters`.

Sensitive fields are now stripped from `Clusters` objects before the object is stored. For objects that existed before this security fix, a one-time migration happens on startup.

**Important:**

* It is highly advised to review for potential leaked credentials in this scenario, and to change them if deemed necessary.
* The final impact severity for confidentiality, integrity and availability is dependent on the permissions that the leaked credentials have on their own services.

### Patches

Patched versions include releases 2.5.13, 2.6.4 and later versions.

### Workarounds

Limit access in Rancher to trusted users. There is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions.

**Important:** It is highly advised to review for potential leaked credentials in this scenario, and to change them if deemed necessary.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.
* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.
* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
