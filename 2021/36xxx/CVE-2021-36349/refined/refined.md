- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) in the DPC DNS client processing within Dell EMC Data Protection Central.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The system is vulnerable to Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF).
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote malicious user can potentially exploit this vulnerability to perform port scanning of external hosts.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted requests to the affected system.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be a remote malicious user and have some level of access that allows them to interact with the vulnerable DPC DNS client processing component. The CVSS vector string indicates that the attacker needs low privileges (`PR:L`) but does not require user interaction (`UI:N`) to execute the attack.
