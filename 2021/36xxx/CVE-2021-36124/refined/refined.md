The provided content is related to CVE-2021-36124. It describes multiple vulnerabilities in ShareCare version 8.15.5, including SQL Injection, Local File Inclusion, Improper Authorization, Unrestricted File Upload, and Command Argument Injection. CVE-2021-36124 specifically refers to the **Unrestricted File Upload** vulnerability.

Here's a breakdown of the Unrestricted File Upload vulnerability as described in the content:

*   **Root cause:** The ShareCare application's file upload feature at `/Access/DownloadFeed_Mnt/FileUpload_Upd.cfm` does not properly sanitize the filename provided by the user through the `name1` parameter. Although a backslash (`\`) filter is implemented, it can be bypassed using forward slashes (`/`) as path delimiters.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Inadequate path sanitization:** The application attempts to filter backslashes from the filename but fails to handle forward slashes, enabling directory traversal.
    *   **Unrestricted file upload:** The application allows the upload of arbitrary file types and does not validate or limit the upload location beyond the Z drive, where the application files reside.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   **Arbitrary file write:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files to any location on the `Z:` drive accessible to the ShareCare service user.
    *   **Remote code execution:** Because the service runs as `NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`, an attacker could upload and execute malicious code, leading to full system compromise.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   **HTTP request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted HTTP request to the `/Access/DownloadFeed_Mnt/FileUpload_Upd.cfm` endpoint with a malicious filename (via `name1` parameter) containing directory traversal sequences using forward slashes, along with the file to upload.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    *   **Authenticated user:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the ShareCare application to access the vulnerable upload endpoint.
