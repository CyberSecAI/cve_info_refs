- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Improper sanitization of user-provided input when creating social media links in user profiles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a victim's browser. This can lead to privilege escalation, potentially compromising the victim's account.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker creates a social media link on their profile that contains a malicious JavaScript payload, such as "javascript:alert(1)".
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an unauthenticated non-admin user capable of creating a social media link on their profile.
