Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36654:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `tgo` parameter, which is used to modify the filename when updating a theme's logo in CMSuno 1.7.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject and store malicious JavaScript code via the vulnerable parameter. This allows an attacker to execute arbitrary scripts in the context of other users' browsers when they view the affected page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious scripts within the victim's browser, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking
    - Cookie theft
    - Defacement of the website
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker crafts a malicious payload within the `tgo` parameter of the request that updates the theme settings.
- **User Interaction:** Once the malicious payload is stored, it is triggered when a user visits the page where the updated logo or related information is displayed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the CMSuno application.
- **Access to Theme Settings:**  The attacker needs access to the area where theme logo settings can be modified.
- **Request Interception:** The attacker needs to intercept the HTTP request used to update the logo. This can be done using tools such as Burp Suite.
- **Payload injection:**  Ability to inject a malicious XSS payload into the intercepted `tgo` parameter.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was reported by `splint3rsec`.
- It was fixed in version 1.7.1 of CMSuno.
- The issue was tracked on GitHub with issue number 17 (`boiteasite/cmsuno#17`).
