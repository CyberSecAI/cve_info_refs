- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists in the RESTCONF API of Dell Networking OS10.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authentication bypass vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A remote, unauthenticated attacker could gain unauthorized access to the affected system and perform actions on it. This could lead to full compromise (confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact).
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, exploiting the RESTCONF API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker is required to be in a remote network position and does not need any prior authentication. However, the attack complexity is high.
