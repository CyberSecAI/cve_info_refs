- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds write
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write issue.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: Not specified in detail, but it involves an unspecified method to trigger an out-of-bounds write.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious file or trigger a specific operation in InDesign that leads to an out-of-bounds write to execute code within the user's context.
