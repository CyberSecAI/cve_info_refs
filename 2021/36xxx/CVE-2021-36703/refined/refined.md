Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described:

**1. Arbitrary File Deletion**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `backup.html.php` file where the `unlink` function is used without proper sanitization of the input filename. Specifically, the code uses `unlink("backup/$file")` directly with the user-supplied `$file` variable.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Path Traversal:** The `$file` variable is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to use directory traversal sequences like `../` to access files outside of the intended `backup` directory.
    *   **Arbitrary File Deletion:** Because the `unlink` function is used, an attacker can delete any file on the server that the webserver process has permission to access.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   Deletion of critical system files can lead to a denial of service or complete system compromise.
    *   In the provided example, the attacker deletes the `admin.ini` file, preventing administrators from logging in.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exposed through the `/admin/backup` endpoint.
    *   The attacker needs to be authenticated to access the admin panel.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the system, with access to the admin panel.
    *   The attacker needs to craft a malicious URL with a path traversal sequence in the file parameter e.g., `../config/users/admin.ini`.

**2. Persistent XSS on Blog Title**

*   **Root Cause:** The application fails to properly sanitize or encode user-supplied blog titles before displaying them on the page.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The blog title is rendered without using `htmlentities`, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   When a user views the page, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browser, potentially allowing the attacker to steal cookies, redirect the user to another site, or perform other malicious actions in the context of the user's session.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exploited by modifying the blog title via the admin interface.
    *   The XSS payload is triggered when the modified blog title is rendered to any user visiting the affected pages.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permissions to modify blog titles.

**3. Persistent XSS on Creating Regular Blog Posts**

*   **Root Cause:**  The application does not properly sanitize or encode user-supplied blog content before displaying it.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *  **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The blog content is rendered without proper sanitization, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code within the blog post content.
*  **Impact of Exploitation:**
    * When a user visits the blog post, the injected JavaScript will execute in their browser, potentially leading to the same consequences as the XSS on blog title i.e., steal cookies, redirect the user, etc.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   The vulnerability is exploited by creating a regular blog post and inserting JavaScript code into the content.
    *   The XSS payload is triggered when the modified blog post is rendered for any user visiting the affected pages.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with permissions to create or modify blog post content.

In summary, the report details an arbitrary file deletion vulnerability due to a lack of input sanitization and two persistent XSS vulnerabilities due to the lack of output encoding of the blog titles and blog post content.
