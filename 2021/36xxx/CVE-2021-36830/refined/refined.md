Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36830:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding within the "Comment Guestbook" WordPress plugin. This allows for the injection of malicious scripts.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected into the website via the plugin. This is further classified as being related to the OWASP Top 10 A7 category: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Injection:** An attacker can inject malicious scripts (JavaScript, HTML, etc.) into the website.
*   **Execution on User Browsers:** These injected scripts execute when other users (guests) visit the affected pages, leading to potential issues such as:
    *   Redirects to malicious websites
    *   Display of unwanted advertisements
    *   Manipulation of website content
    *   Other forms of client-side attacks that could compromise user's browsers or sessions

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Comment Input:** The vulnerability is likely triggered through user-supplied input fields in the comment/guestbook functionality. An attacker would inject malicious script within a comment.
*   **Unsanitized Output:** The injected script is then rendered on the page, causing the user's browser to execute it, because it is not sanitized before output.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Specific Privilege:** The patchstack article states that the required privilege is administrator. This may be an error, as XSS vulnerabilities typically require no elevated privileges, and can be triggered by any user able to post a comment.
*   **Ability to Post Comments:** The attacker needs to be able to post comments, which, in most default WordPress configurations, requires no account.

**Additional Information:**

*   **Plugin Status:** The plugin has been closed and is unavailable for download due to this security issue.
*   **No Official Fix:** There is no official fix available for this vulnerability.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is considered to have a low severity impact, unlikely to be exploited.
*   **Affected Versions:** All versions of the plugin up to and including 0.8.0 are vulnerable.

**Summary of Extracted Information:**
The WordPress Comment Guestbook plugin up to version 0.8.0 has a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability that allows malicious actors to inject harmful scripts into the website via comment submissions. These scripts can execute on visitor browsers, potentially redirecting them or performing other unwanted actions. The plugin is no longer available, and there is no official patch. While rated as low severity, the impact can affect user experience by displaying ads, and more seriously could expose visitors to browser based attacks.
