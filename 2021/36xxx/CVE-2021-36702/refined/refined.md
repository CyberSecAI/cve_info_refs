Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities:

**1. Arbitrary File Deletion**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from insecure handling of the `file` parameter in the `backup.html.php` script when deleting backup files. The `unlink()` function is used directly on the user-supplied filename without proper sanitization or validation.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Path Traversal:**  The lack of input validation allows an attacker to use path traversal sequences (e.g., `../`) to navigate outside the intended backup directory.
    *   **Insecure `unlink()` usage:** The `unlink()` function directly uses the user provided file path.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can delete any file on the server that the webserver process has access to, leading to potential data loss, system instability, or denial of service. In the provided example, the attacker deletes the `admin.ini` configuration file, preventing administrator logins.
*   **Attack Vector:** By sending a crafted GET request with a modified `file` parameter containing directory traversal sequences to the `/admin/backup` endpoint.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Authenticated access to the admin panel.

**2. Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on Blog Title**

*   **Root Cause:**  The blog title is not properly sanitized before being displayed, allowing arbitrary JavaScript code to be injected.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Lack of Output Encoding:** The blog title is displayed without proper encoding like `htmlentities`, allowing embedded HTML tags like `<script>` to be executed in the victim's browser.
*   **Impact:**  An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will execute in the browser of any user who views the blog page, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** By modifying the blog title field in the admin panel to include JavaScript code.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Authenticated access to the admin panel to modify the blog title.

**3. Persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) on Blog Post Content**

*   **Root Cause:**  Similar to the blog title XSS, the blog post content is not properly sanitized before being displayed.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **Lack of Output Encoding:** The blog post content is displayed without proper encoding, allowing embedded HTML tags to be executed in the victim's browser.
*    **Impact:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript that will execute in the browser of any user who views the blog post, potentially stealing cookies, redirecting users, or performing other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vector:** By creating or modifying a blog post, including malicious javascript code in the content.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:**
    *   Authenticated access to the admin panel to create or edit blog posts.
