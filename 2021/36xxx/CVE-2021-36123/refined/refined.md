The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in ShareCare version 8.15.5. While the content mentions CVE-2021-36123, it describes it in the context of other vulnerabilities found in the same software.

Here's a breakdown of the identified vulnerabilities, including the one associated with CVE-2021-36123:

**CVE-2021-36123 is related to Local File Inclusion**

*   **Root Cause:** The `TextReader.cfm` component does not properly validate or sanitize the `textFile` parameter, which is used to specify the file to read.
*   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input validation, allowing arbitrary file paths.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the server's file system, including those accessible through UNC paths. This could lead to the exposure of sensitive information.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted HTTP request to `TextReader.cfm` with a malicious `textFile` parameter.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated user.

**Other Vulnerabilities Described:**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** User-supplied input is directly concatenated into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization, vulnerable code patterns across the application, using `LIKE` operator for session validation.
    *   **Impact:** Bypassing authentication, exfiltrating or manipulating sensitive data. Unauthenticated attackers can bypass authentication.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending malicious SQL statements as URL parameters.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Unauthenticated access for some injection points, authenticated user for others.
*   **Improper Authorization:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Lack of authentication checks on certain sensitive pages.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Inconsistent application of authorization and authentication.
    *   **Impact:** Allows unauthenticated access to vulnerable pages which can be exploited using other vulnerabilities like SQL injection to compromise ShareCare and patient data.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Accessing vulnerable pages directly without authentication.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** No authentication is required.
*   **Unrestricted File Upload:**
    *  **Root Cause:** Inadequate filtering of the `name1` parameter, which defines the path of the uploaded file. The application only filters backslashes but not forward slashes.
    *  **Weaknesses:**  Insufficient input sanitization, incorrect filtering.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can upload arbitrary files to any directory on the `Z:` drive which can lead to Remote Code Execution as the ShareCare service user (NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM).
    *   **Attack Vector:** Uploading a file with a malicious file path via the `FileUpload_Upd.cfm` endpoint.
    *  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated user.
*   **Command Argument Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** User-supplied input (`Form.zippass`) is directly passed as an argument to the `7z.exe` command-line utility without any sanitization.
    *   **Weaknesses:** Lack of input sanitization and direct usage of user input in system calls.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can inject arbitrary arguments to the 7z command, possibly leading to code execution or system compromise.
    *   **Attack Vector:**  Crafting a malicious value for the `zippass` parameter when using the `UnzipFile_Upd.cfm` endpoint.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities:** Authenticated user.
