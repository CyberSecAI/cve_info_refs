Create category 5. insert payload bypass xss:    `<a href="javascript&colon;alert&lpar;1337&rpar;">Click2</a>` 6. Click Categories >> Click2 >> Boom alert message xss!   **Impact** Commonly include transmitting private data, like cookies or other session information, to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user’s machine under the guise of the vulnerable site. **POC** [image_2021-07-07_19-43-05](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62001260/124762124-c03adb00-df5c-11eb-8dd1-d58aac88de4b.png) [image_2021-07-07_19-41-40](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62001260/124762142-c6c95280-df5c-11eb-88fa-98d08bccba77.png) [image_2021-07-07_19-40-58](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/62001260/124762145-c761e900-df5c-11eb-9437-8f9ad229a8f5.png) |
