Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36786:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The TYPO3 extension "Miniorange Saml" (miniorange_saml) contains sensitive data (API credentials and a private key) that should not have been published within the extension.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Sensitive Data Exposure:** The extension includes API credentials and a private key. This constitutes a significant security risk as these can be used to compromise the system the extension is installed on or any other system that these credentials provide access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Full Compromise:** If attackers obtain the exposed API credentials and private key, they could potentially gain full control of the system, as the exposed information can be used to access the resources secured by those credentials.
- **Data breaches:** Access to the private key can lead to decryption of encrypted data handled by the extension.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Direct Access:** An attacker could directly obtain the sensitive data by having access to the extension's code, for instance, by downloading the extension or gaining access to the server's files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to the Extension:** An attacker needs access to the extension's code or files. This could be achieved by:
  - Downloading the extension from a public source.
  - Gaining unauthorized access to the server where the extension is hosted.
