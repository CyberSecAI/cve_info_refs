Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-36132:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incomplete permission check in the `Special:ImportFile` page of the MediaWiki FileImporter extension. The extension allows setting required rights via the `$wgFileImporterRequiredRight` configuration. However, the special page does not properly enforce this configured right, leading to potential unauthorized access. The `SpecialPage::userCanExecute` function was not being called.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The `Special:ImportFile` page does not correctly check the user's permissions against the configured `$wgFileImporterRequiredRight`. This means that users who should not have access to the page might be able to interact with it.
*   **Missing Permission Check:** The special page was not calling  `SpecialPage::checkPermissions` and thereby bypassing the permission check.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized File Imports:** An attacker, or a user without the intended permissions, could potentially import files through the `Special:ImportFile` page. This could be done by crafting a specific request with parameters, bypassing the missing input form that would normally appear with `$wgFileImporterShowInputScreen = true;`
*   **Potential for Malicious Content:** Depending on the permissions associated with the configured right, if the attacker could bypass the permission check, this could lead to the introduction of malicious files or data into the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct Access to the Special Page:** An attacker could access the `Special:ImportFile` page directly by navigating to it, or by crafting a specific request with parameters. The input form does not appear with the configuration flag set to false, but the page is still accessible.
*   **Bypassing Intended Restrictions:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended permission restrictions set by the wiki administrator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Wiki:** The attacker needs to have access to the MediaWiki instance where the FileImporter extension is installed. They do not need to be a sysop.
*   **Basic Web Interaction:** The attacker needs the ability to craft or use a specially crafted URL to interact with the `Special:ImportFile` page

**Additional Information:**

*   The vulnerability is not considered a high-risk security issue for Wikimedia wikis due to the default configuration and the fact that a default `upload` permission check is in place. The issue primarily affects third-party installations using a custom configuration.
*   The vulnerability was fixed by ensuring the special page correctly checked permissions against the `$wgFileImporterRequiredRight` configuration. This was done by calling `SpecialPage::checkPermissions` within the `execute` function of `SpecialImportFile.php`
*   The fix was backported to the `REL1_35` and `REL1_36` branches of the FileImporter extension

In summary, CVE-2021-36132 stems from a missing permission check on the `Special:ImportFile` page, allowing unauthorized users to potentially import files. Although not a high risk for Wikimedia wikis, it is a legitimate security issue for third-party installations using custom access control configurations.
