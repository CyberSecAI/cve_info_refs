#### High Performance

MashShare Social Media ecosystem is *coded well and developed for high performance*. It´s making full use of available persistent and non-persistent caching techniques.

MashShare loads only the Javascript and PHP object classes it needs at the moment of execution, making it small and fast, and easily extensible by a third-party developer.

#### How fast is MashShare?

We published benchmarks of using MashShare compared with other plugins here:

https://www.mashshare.net/mashshare-proven-fast-benchmark/

**Shortcodes**

* Use `[mashshare]` anywhere in pages or post’s text to show the buttons and total social share count wherever you like.

  Social Share Buttons will be shown exactly on the place where you copy the shortcode in your content.

There are more parameters available:

* Embed social share buttons in pages or posts: `[mashshare]`
* Buttons without sharecount: `[mashshare shares="false"]`
* Sharecount only: `[mashshare buttons="false"]`
* Social share buttons alignment: `[mashshare shares="false" buttons="true" align="left|right"]`
* Shortcode in template files via php: `echo do_shortcode('[mashshare]');`
* Custom url: `[mashshare url="http://www.google.de"]`
* Custom social share text: `[mashshare text="This is my custom social share text"]`
* For manual insertion of the Social Share Buttons in your template files use the following PHP code on the place you like to see the social share buttons:`echo do_shortcode('[mashshare]');`

  Configure the Social Media Share buttons sharing function in the settings page of the plugin.
* Change the color of MashShare count with the setting option.

**Full SEO third party plugin support**

MashShare integrates with [All in One SEO Pack](https://wordpress.org/plugins/all-in-one-seo-pack/) and [WordPress SEO by Yoast](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wordpress-seo/).

Any description and title which is defined in Yoast open graph settings will be used by MashShare Open Graph Settings

#### How does it work?

MashShare makes use of public available API endpoints that are delivered by social networks. It periodically checks for the total count of all your Facebook and Twitter shares and cumulates them. It then shows the total number beside the social share and Social Media Icons.

No need to embed dozens of external slow loading scripts into your website.

#### How to install and setup?

Install it via the admin dashboard and to ‘Plugins’, click ‘Add New’ and search the plugins for ‘MashShare’. Install the plugin with ‘Install Now’.

After installation go to the settings page Settings->MashShare and make your changes there.

## FAQ

> Find here the Frequently Asked Questions. Also, look into our docs which is often more up to date:
>
> http://docs.mashshare.net/

#### There are no social media share buttons visible after updating or installing MashShare

Share buttons are not visible sometimes when you are using the MashShare Network Add-On which is disabled during the update process or when you are updating from a very early MashShare version 1.x.

Solution: Disable MashShare Social Media Network Add-On and MashShare Core plugin. Enable first MashShare THAN the Social Media Network Add-On and all Social Media Share buttons to become visible again. (Activating order is important here)

#### Why is the Social Media share count not shown immediately after sharing?

It takes some time for the script to detect the total social share count. So wait a few minutes then you see the total calculated clicks. Keep also in mind the caching time you defined in the admin panel.

So when you set the plugin to 5 minutes caching time. You have to wait at least for 5 minutes until the social share click count is shown.

#### Do I need a MashShare account to use the social share buttons?

There is no account needed in Mashshare but you need social media accounts to share. All code resides on your website and there is no account or any monthly fee necessary to use MashShare.

#### Does this plugin sends any personal user data to you or Facebook, Twitter, etc.?

No, there is no personal data send to Facebook, Twitter, Google, and other services. No data goes to MashShare that includes any IP or other data without your explicit grant.

The big advantage of using Mashable social share buttons is the independence in comparison to other plugins which creates steady connections to Facebook and Co.

So there is no IP based data send to the social networks or shared count.

#### Do I have to do manual changes in Javascript or HTML Code?

There is no need for you to make any manual changes. The plugin does everything for you. But if you are an experienced web-developer you are free to use the PHP function mashsharer(); in your templates.

#### Is there a shortcode for pages and posts?

Use the shortcode [mashshare] to embed the social share Buttons in pages or posts.

#### Why is Facebook sharing only the URL and not the title and description of my page?

You need to enable the open graph settings or install a plugin like Yoast which injects open graph tags into your site

Really Good Plugins to Increase Engagement. Add Automatically Shared Count instead of sharedcount api.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
