Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a lack of proper input sanitization or output encoding in the Feehi CMS login form. The application reflects user input directly onto the web page without sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is an XSS vulnerability. The application fails to neutralize or encode user-supplied input allowing the injection of malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.
- **Session Hijacking:** This could potentially lead to session hijacking, allowing attackers to take control of user accounts.
- **Malicious Actions:** An attacker could perform actions on behalf of the user, such as stealing credentials or performing unauthorized transactions.
- **Website Defacement:** JavaScript can be used to modify the content of the page, defacing the website.
- **Redirect Users:** Attackers could redirect users to malicious sites, causing further harm.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Form:** The vulnerability is located in the Feehi CMS login form. The attacker injects malicious JavaScript code into the form input fields.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send a crafted request to the vulnerable login form.
- **Basic Knowledge of XSS:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of XSS attacks to craft the payload.
- **No authentication:** This vulnerability appears to be exploitable without prior authentication since it's on the login form.

**Additional Notes:**
