# Risks

CVSS 3.4

##### 3.4

### Cross Site Scripting (XSS)

This could allow a malicious actor to inject malicious scripts, such as redirects, advertisements, and other HTML payloads into your website which will be executed when guests visit your site.

This is a general description of this vulnerability type, specific impact varies case by case.
CVSS score is a way to evaluate and rank reported vulnerabilities in a standardized and repeatable way, but it is not ideal for CMSs.

# Solutions

This security issue has a low severity impact and is unlikely to be exploited.

![Update to version X or later](https://patchstack.com/database/img/update-checkmark.svg)
### Update to version 4.4.0 or later.

Update to version 4.4.0 or later to remove the vulnerability.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

# WP-Appbox

By [Marcel Schmilgeit](https://tchgdns.de)

[Download](https://downloads.wordpress.org/plugin/wp-appbox.4.5.4.zip)

* [Details](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-appbox/#description)
* [Reviews](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-appbox/#reviews)
* [Development](https://wordpress.org/plugins/wp-appbox/#developers)

[Support](https://wordpress.org/support/plugin/wp-appbox/)

## Description

With WP-Appbox you can add beautiful mobile app badges to your WordPress posts and pages simply by adding a shortcode. WP-Appbox supports the following app stores:

Apps & Software:

\* Amazon Apps (only via PA API 5.0)

\* Alexa Skills (only via PA API 5.0)

\* Apple App Store

\* F-Droid

\* Google Play Store

\* Huawei AppGallery (highly experimental!)

\* Microsoft Store

\* Snapcraft

\* WordPress-Plugins

Browser Extensions:

\* Chrome Web Store

\* Microsoft Edge-Add-ons

\* Firefox Add-ons

\* Opera Add-ons

Games:

\* GOG.com (Good Old Games)

\* Steam (only single games)

#### Usage of the shortcode

All stores are integrated in a short code and can be inserted via button in the WordPress editor. The structure of the short code is always the following:

[appbox *storename* *app-id* *style*]

The order does not matter – as long as “appbox” is on the front. The blind names are: amazonapps, appstore, chromewebstore, fdroid, firefoxaddon, firefoxmarketplace, goodoldgames, googleplay, operaaddons, steam, windowsstore and wordpress. How to get the ID of the corresponding apps is illustrated in the settings for WP-Appbox. The default format is “simple”, alternatively there is also an ad with “compact”, “screenshots” and “screenshots-only”.

There is another special feature for the App Store: With Universal Apps you can decide whether you want to get screenshots of the iPhone, iPad and the Watch App, or for example only of the iPhone, only of the iPad or only of the Watch App. All you need to do is simply attach a “-iphone”, “-ipad” or “-watch” to the ID of the app. Example: 392502056-ipad.

By the way, the special feature is also available for the Windows Store: Here, too, only the mobile screenshots or those of the desktop version can be displayed. All you have to do is attach a “-mobile” or “-desktop” to the App-ID. Example: 392502056-mobile.

#### Further Features

* Display a QR code with MouseOver
* Adaptation to mobile devices with smaller displays
* Adaptation to the feed output
* Caching of data for performance purposes
* Use of user-specific Affiliate IDs
* Fully customizable via HTML and CSS

#### Requirements

* PHP min. 5.3
* WordPress min. 3.4
* Server with allow\_url\_fopen, cURL (curl\_init and curl\_exec) and mb\_eregi enabled
* Outgoing requests must be allowed

#### Support

Support requests and problems should ideally be reported directly on the [Blog](https://tchgdns.de/wp-appbox-app-badge-fuer-google-play-mac-app-store-windows-store-windows-phone-store-co/ "Blog") or even better via [Mastodon](https://mastodon.social/%40marcelismus "Mastodon"). I can’t promise a quick solution for every problem, but I try to solve every problem. 😉

## FAQ

### Which server requirements are necessary?

The server must run at least PHP 5.3 and support cURL and mb\_eregi.

### Can the output of the box be adapted to the theme design?

Yes, all elements of the WP-Appbox can be customized via CSS. It is also possible to deactivate the CSS stylesheet of the plugin in the settings. In addition, you can create your own templates for the output (see below).

### How can I create my own templates?

You can simply copy the existing standard templates (folder “tpl”) into your theme folder. The files can be given the following names:

* your-theme-folder/wpappbox-simple.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox-compact.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox-screenshots.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox-screenshots-only.php

Or just put the templates inside a folder called “wp-appbox” and keep the original names:

* your-theme-folder/wpappbox/simple.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox/compact.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox/screenshots.php
* your-theme-folder/wpappbox/screenshots-only.php

In the user-defined template files, the output can be adjusted to any desired value. The available variables can be found in the original files. 😉

### Are AMP plugins supported?

Basically, yes. However, the CSS of the WP-Appbox has to be implemented manually into your AMP page. How this works depends on your plugin.

### How is the QR code generated?

After Google discontinued its Charts API several years ago and has now finally switched it off, the [API from goqr.me](https://goqr.me/api/doc/create-qr-code/) is used to generate the QR codes.

### The Chrome Web Store only displays the first screenshot

Unfortunately Google only loads the first screenshot into the HTML output of the Chrome Web Store, all other screenshots are dynamically reloaded. Therefore the output of several screenshots via WP-Appbox is not possible at the moment.

### Is WP-Appbox compliant with DSGVO?

Basically: yes. But it depends on the settings. The plugin itself does not store any user data. However, external images from Apple, Google, Amazon and Co. are integrated. Depending on the interpretation of the DSGVO, this is problematic. If you don’t want to supplement your data protection information, you can use two possible options:

* Activate the image proxy, which embeds external images in the WP appbox using its own URL. However, this can impair performance, especially with a large number of page calls.
* Activate the image cache. All images are stored on your own server. This variant is always recommended, because it improves performance and the images are still displayed even if the app is no longer available in the respective store. 😉

### Amazon Product Advertising API 5.0

The Amazon Product Advertising API 5.0 is used for Android apps and Alexa Skills from Amazon. Own access is required for use, [more information can be found here](https://webservices.amazon.com/paapi5/documentation/). The PA API 5.0 information can be entered in the “advanced settings” tab of WP-Appbox. Please note that no exact error checking can be done and depending on the access level, the queries can be exhausted quickly. Currently experimental.

### Is the Gutenberg editor supported?

A first implementation is available. However, this is experimental in nature and is not officially supported. With WordPress 6.2 there are problems with the block, but so far I have not found a solution. Classic Editor is therefore recommended 😉
