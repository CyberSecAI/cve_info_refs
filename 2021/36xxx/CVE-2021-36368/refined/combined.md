# CVE-2021-36368

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2021-36222.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2021-36370.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-36368 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36368)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."

# CVE-2021-36368

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2021-36222.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2021-36370.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-36368 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36368)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."

# CVE-2021-36368

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-36368 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36368)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=2086690#c0)  TEJ RATHI    2022-05-16 13:18:57 UTC  ``` ** DISPUTED ** An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."  <https://github.com/openssh/openssh-portable/pull/258> <https://docs.ssh-mitm.at/trivialauth.html> <https://bugzilla.mindrot.org/show_bug.cgi?id=3316> <https://www.openssh.com/security.html> <https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-2021-36368>   ``` |  |

OpenSSH: Security

## [*Open***SSH**](/) Security

---

OpenSSH is developed with the same rigorous security process that the
OpenBSD group is famous for. If you wish to report a security issue in
OpenSSH, please contact the private developers list <openssh@openssh.com>.

For more information, see the
[OpenBSD security page](https://www.openbsd.org/security.html).

* **July 1, 2024**

  sshd(8) in Portable OpenSSH versions 8.5p1 to 9.7p1 (inclusive).

  Race condition resulting in potential remote code execution.

  A race condition in sshd(8) could allow remote code execution as
  root on non-OpenBSD systems. This attack could be prevented by
  disabling the login grace timeout (LoginGraceTime=0 in
  sshd\_config) though this makes denial-of service against
  sshd(8) considerably easier.

  For more information, please refer to the
  [release notes](txt/release-9.8) and the report from the
  [Qualys Security Advisory Team](https://www.qualys.com/2024/07/01/cve-2024-6387/regresshion.txt) who discovered the bug.* **July 1, 2024**

    ssh(1) in OpenSSH versions 9.5p1 to 9.7p1 (inclusive).

    Logic error in ObscureKeystrokeTiming option.

    A logic error in the implementation of the ssh(1) ObscureKeystrokeTiming
    option rendered the feature ineffective and additionally exposed limited
    keystroke timing information when terminal echo was disabled, e.g. while
    entering passwords to su(8) or sudo(8). This condition could be avoided
    for affected versions by disabling the feature using
    ObscureKeystrokeTiming=no.

    For more information, please refer to the
    [release notes](txt/release-9.8).* **December 18, 2023**

      ssh(1), sshd(8) in OpenSSH prior to version 9.6.

      Weakness in initial key exchange ("Terrapin Attack")

      A weakness in the initial SSH protocol key exchange allows an
      on-path attacker to delete a number of consecutive messages from
      the early encrypted protocol without detection. While cryptographically
      novel, there is no discernable impact on the integrity of SSH traffic
      beyond giving the attacker the ability to delete the message that
      enables some features related to keystroke timing obfuscation.

      This attack is prevented by a new protocol extension in OpenSSH 9.6.

      For more information, please refer to the
      [release notes](txt/release-9.6).* **December 18, 2023**

        ssh-agent(1) in OpenSSH between 8.9 and 9.5 (inclusive)

        Incomplete application of destination constraints to smartcard keys.

        Destination constraints added when loading PKCS#11 keys from a token
        were being applied to only the first key returned from the token.

        This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.6.

        For more information, please refer to the
        [release notes](txt/release-9.6).* **July 19, 2023**

          ssh-agent(1) in OpenSSH between and 5.5 and 9.3p1 (inclusive)
          remote code execution relating to PKCS#11 providers

          The PKCS#11 support ssh-agent(1) could be abused to achieve remote
          code execution via a forwarded agent socket if the following conditions
          are met:
          + Exploitation requires the presence of specific libraries on the victim system.
          + Remote exploitation requires that the agent was forwarded to an attacker-controlled system.Exploitation can also be prevented by starting ssh-agent(1) with an
          empty PKCS#11/FIDO allowlist (ssh-agent -P '') or by configuring
          an allowlist that contains only specific provider libraries.

          This vulnerability was discovered and demonstrated to be exploitable
          by the Qualys Security Advisory team. This vulnerability has been
          assigned CVE-2023-38408.

          This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.3p2. For OpenBSD, an
          [errata](https://www.openbsd.org/errata.html)

            ssh-add(1) in OpenSSH between and 8.9 and 9.2 (inclusive).

            ssh-add(1) did not apply destination constraints to smartcard keys.

            When adding smartcard keys to ssh-agent(1) with the per-hop destination
            constraints (*ssh-add -h ...*), a logic error prevented the
            constraints from being communicated to the agent. This resulted in the
            keys being added without constraints. The common cases of
            non-smartcard keys and keys without destination constraints are
            unaffected.

            This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.3.

              ssh(1) in OpenSSH between and 8.7 and 9.1 (inclusive).

              ssh(1) failed to correctly process PermitRemoteOpen options.

              The PermitRemoteOpen option
              would ignore its first argument unless it was one of the special
              keywords "any" or "none", causing the permission list to fail open
              if only one permission was specified.

              This bug is corrected in OpenSSH 9.2.

                ssh(1) in OpenSSH between and 6.5 and 9.1 (inclusive).

                ssh(1) failed to check DNS names returned from libc for validity.

                If the CanonicalizeHostname and CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs
                options were enabled, and the system/libc resolver did not check
                that names in DNS responses were valid, then use of these options
                could allow an attacker with control of DNS to include invalid
                characters (possibly including wildcards) in names added to
                known\_hosts files when they were updated. These names would still
                have to match the CanonicalizePermittedCNAMEs allow-list, so
                practical exploitation appears unlikely.

                  sshd in OpenSSH between and 9.1 (only).

                  Double-free memory fault in pre-authentication sshd process.

                  sshd(8) contained a network-reachable pre-authentication double-free
                  memory fault introduced in OpenSSH 9.1. This is not believed to be

                    sshd in OpenSSH between 6.2 and 8.7 (inclusive).

                    sshd(8) failed to correctly initialise supplemental groups when
                    executing an `AuthorizedKeysCommand` or
                    `AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand`, where a
                    `AuthorizedKeysCommandUser` or
                    `AuthorizedPrincipalsCommandUser` directive was been set to
                    run the command as a non-root user. Instead these commands would inherit
                    the groups that sshd(8) was started with.

                    Depending on system configuration, inherited groups may allow
                    the helper programs to gain unintended privilege.

                    Neither `AuthorizedKeysCommand` nor
                    `AuthorizedPrincipalsCommand` are enabled by default in

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

# SSH agent restriction

**Author:** Damien Miller <djm@openssh.com>

**Last modified:** 2022-01-10

## TLDR

OpenSSH 8.9 will include the ability to control how and where keys in
ssh-agent may be used, both locally and when forwarded (subject to some
[limitations](#limitations)).

## Background

The OpenSSH SSH protocol implementation includes the ssh-agent
authentication agent. This tool supports two overlapping uses: a safe
runtime store for unwrapped private keys, removing the need to enter a
passphrase for each use, and a way to forward access to private keys to
remote hosts, without exposing the private keys themselves.

The agent is a deliberately simple program, since it holds private
keys we consider it part of the [TCB](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trusted_computing_base) and so want to minimise its attack
surface. It speaks a simple, client-initiated [protocol](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/draft-miller-ssh-agent) with a small
number of operations including adding or deleting keys, retrieving
a list of public halves for loaded keys and, critically, making a
signature using a private key. Most interactions with the agent are
through the [ssh-add](https://man.openbsd.org/ssh-add.1) tool for adding, deleting and listing keys and ssh,
which can use keys held in an agent for user authentication, but other
tools can also be used if they speak the protocol.

As mentioned above, access to the agent can be forwarded to a remote
host. Typically this happens by a SSH client and server arranging to
allow remote programs to establish a connection to a local agent and
exchange messages over that connection. A forwarded agent appears
effectively identical to a local one, as (until now) the protocol
offered no way to distinguish between them.

Unfortunately, because the agent holds sensitive keys, it is a desirable
and frequently-exploited target for attackers. A typical scenario begins
with a user forwarding their agent to a host that is controlled by an
attacker. Once this occurs, the attacker has full use of the keys held
in the agent and they will typically use them to authenticate a SSH
connection to a host they'd like to access.

While it is generally better for users to avoid the use of a forwarded
agent altogether (e.g. using the ProxyJump directive),
the agent protocol itself has offered little defence against this sort of
attack. It is possible to make keys auto-expire after a time period
or mark a key as requiring confirmation (via a popup window) for each
use, but these are seldom used and confirmation is somewhat easy to
phish, e.g. if an attacker knows when a user is likely to be making
SSH connections - unfortunately the confirmation popups can offer no
information on the destination host being authenticated to or the
forwarding path the request arrived over. FIDO keys that require
user-presence confirmation offer a little more defence, but are also
similarly phishable.

## What would be better?

Thinking about what would be a better set of controls lets us identify
some possible requirements for a safer agent protocol.

An easy win for improving the security of the agent would be to provide
better separation between the two use-cases mentioned above. Adding a
key to an agent for local use should not necessarily make it available
on a forwarded agent. This would let users store keys in the agent with
less worry that they might be used on a malicious host. So the first
requirement is being able to add keys to an agent for local (i.e. not
forwarded) use only.

Conversely, forwarded agents are useful too, but not all remote hosts
are equally trustworthy and users often connect to hosts in entirely
different trust domains (e.g. a user at a laptop connecting to testing,
production or personal environments). A good solution would allow
forwarding varying subsets of keys to different remote hosts.

Since forwarding chains sometimes involve several hops, we'd like
key forwarding restrictions to be applied hop by hop, with each
additional hop only ever removing keys from those available for use
at the destination. Having gone to the trouble of making a system
of restrictions that can reason about key availability based on the
forwarding path, it would also be good to display path information in
confirmation dialogs. E.g. a notification for a FIDO key could state the
destination host and the path over which the request was forwarded.

Of course, the whole purpose of this exercise is to make agent
forwarding more secure. In particular, the system should
cryptographically guarantee that a key is never usable for
authentication to an unintended destination and that forwarded keys are
only visible/available through permitted hosts. Finally, the system
should fail safe when some participant lacks the protocol features that
it needs to function.

## Agent restriction in OpenSSH

OpenSSH 8.9 will include an experimental set of agent restrictions
that meet the above requirements, though with some caveats ([discussed
below](#limitations)). These are built around some two simple agent protocol extensions
and a small modification to the public key authentication protocol.

These extensions allow the user to add *destination constraints* to keys they add to a ssh-agent and have ssh enforce them. For example, this command:

```

$ ssh-add -h "perseus@cetus.example.org" \
          -h "scylla.example.org" \
          -h "scylla.example.org>medea@charybdis.example.org" \
          ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

```

Adds a key that can only be used for authentication in the following
circumstances:

1. From the origin host to scylla.example.org as any user.
2. From the origin host to cetus.example.org as user perseus.
3. Through scylla.example.org to host charybdis.example.org as user medea.

Attempts to use this key to authenticate to other hosts will be refused
by the agent because they weren't explicitly listed, as would an
attempt to authenticate through scylla.example.org to cetus.example.org
because the path was not permitted. Likewise, trying to authenticate
as any other user then perseus to cetus.example.org or medea to
charybdis.example.org would fail because the destination users are not
permitted.

Deeper chains of forwarding restrictions are possible, with each hop needing to be specified separately:

```

$ ssh-add -h "scylla.example.org" \
          -h "cetus.example.org" \
          -h "scylla.example.org>charybdis.example.org" \
          -h "cetus.example.org>charybdis.example.org" \
          -h "charybdis.example.org>hydra.example.org" \
          ~/.ssh/id_ed25519

```

Note that this set of restrictions permits two different paths by which
the ultimate destination of hydra.example.org could be reached:

![allowed forwarding paths](data:image/png;base64...)

At each hop, only the keys that are permitted for use there are
visible. For example, if the user tried to list the available keys on
hydra.example.org, this key would not be shown as available. Similarly,
attempts to remove or adjust options on a restricted key will be refused
anywhere other than on the origin machine.

## Limitations

### Protocol extensions are required

The most immediate practical consideration is that this feature requires
protocol extensions in ssh-agent, ssh-add, ssh and sshd for most
participating hosts. The requirement to run an updated ssh-agent, ssh
and ssh-add is fairly obvious (older versions simply don't support
the feature), but the need to run an updated SSH server is less obvious
(the reason is [discussed below](#authverify)) and is more likely to be a challenge to
deployment.

### Permitted forwarding hosts are identified by hostkey

Another practical limitation is due to forwarding constraints
using hostkeys to identify allowed hosts. Hostkeys are the primary
way of identifying hosts within the SSH protocol, and the only
cryptographically-verifiable way that can be plumbed through to the
agent.

When adding a key with destination constraints, ssh-add will use the
local known\_hosts files to map the host names given on the command-line
to hostkeys before passing them to ssh-agent. This means that all the
keys for all the hosts that the user lists must be present in the right
place (the machine running ssh-add) and the right time
(when ssh-add is run).

Hostkeys aren't always the easiest things to work with either. A host
may have multiple keys of different types, or have multiple names - such
as a fully-qualified domain name, an unqualified hostname or just an
address.

If you plan to make use of these new agent controls, then users will
need to maintain good control over their known\_hosts databases. OpenSSH
offers some features that might make this easier, including the
UpdateHostkey extension that allows a client to learn the full set of a
server's hostkeys (this has recently been enabled by default), and the
CanonicalizeHostname option that makes it easier for a client to store
and refer to fully-qualified hostnames when unqualified names are used.

The situation for certificate hostkeys is considerably simpler. If
certificate hostkeys are in use, then the host running ssh-add only
needs the CA key(s) for the hosts listed in destination constraints, and
will be able to match certificates made by these CA keys by name. This
is another good reason to use host certificates in organisational
settings.

### Destinations are much more trustworthy than paths

Destination constraints are checked by ssh-agent, using information
passed from a cooperating ssh. If an agent is forward to an
attacker-controlled host, then they will still be able to steal use of a
forwarded agent on that host.

Less obviously, they will also be able to forward use of the agent
to other hosts, e.g. by using an SSH implementation that doesn't
cooperate with ssh-agent, or another tool entirely, such as socat. Note
that the attacker isn't gaining any new access to keys here, they are
still forced to act via the compromised host and their access is still
restricted to the keys that were permitted for use though the intended
host only.

A related attack involves a malicious hop replaying session binding
messages ([see below](#pathtrust)). They are able to do this because there is no way
for ssh-agent to guarantee freshness of these messages. This attack
allows a malicious hop to make the forwarding path appear longer than it
actually is.

In all cases however, the final destination cannot be forged because of
the [binding](#authverify) between the signature and the server hostkey. Because the binding
is supplied by the local client, it's also reasonable to assume that the
the identity of the first hop in a forwarding path is correct too.

Because of these subtleties, it's better to think of key constraints
as permitting use of a key through a given host rather than as from a
particular host, and, more generally, that any forwarding path is only
as strong as its weakest link. Another helpful way to think about key
constraints is that each one represents a delegation of a key to a host,
that is only slightly more trustworthy than the delegate is.

### Protocol extensions assume a particular sequence of operations

The restriction checking in ssh-agent makes strong assumptions on what
operations are performed over agent connections. This is only likely
to matter to authors of tools that interact with the agent protocol
directly.

In OpenSSH, one connection from the ssh client to the agent is made for
user authentication, and this is closed after user authentication is
completed. When a SSH session with a forwarded agent is established,
additional agent connections are made as necessary when operations that
invoke the agent are performed (e.g. to list keys or authenticate to
another host).

The agent protocol extension deliberately treats the initial connection
that ssh makes for authentication differently to connections made for
agent forwarding. Other SSH implementations that want to use these
extensions will have to follow this pattern.

### Restrictions only work for user authentication

Destination restrictions in ssh-agent strongly depend on the agent being
able to parse the data being signed, and the contents having all the
information needed to compare against the restrictions listed for a
given key. SSH user authentication requests have a format that meets
these requirements, but other uses of the agent protocol are not likely
to.

In particular, it is currently not possible to use
destination-restricted keys for SSH signatures via ssh-keygen, CA
operations, etc. It may be possible to relax this limitation
([see below](#nextsteps)).

## How it works

Destination-restricted keys are implemented through three fairly simply
protocol extensions:

* A new agent protocol key constraint extension to allow communicating destination restrictions from ssh-add to ssh-agent.
* A new agent protocol session binding extension to allow ssh to inform ssh-agent of where keys are being used.
* A modified publickey authentication method used between ssh and sshd that incorporates the server hostkey into the signed data.

These protocol extensions ensure the new permission-checking logic agent
has all the requisite information that it needs to cryptographically
verify the intended destination for authentication requests and the path
over which it travelled.

A detailed specification for the wire format for each of these
extensions can be found via the OpenSSH source distribution's PROTOCOL
file.

### Restricting keys

The protocol extensions begin with adding a destination-constrained key
to ssh-agent using the ssh-add tool.

When requested to add a key with one or more constraints for use
to/through particular hosts, ssh-add will look up the host's hostkeys
from the local known\_hosts database and encode them along with the key
in the SSH2\_AGENTC\_ADD\_IDENTITY message. Specifically, one or more of
the following per-hop constraints will be encoded:

```

byte         SSH_AGENT_CONSTRAIN_EXTENSION (0xff)
string       "restrict-destination-v00@openssh.com"
constraint[] constraints
 	string    [empty]
string    from_hostname
keyspec[] from_keyspec
    string    keyblob
    bool      key_is_ca
string    to_username
string    to_hostname
keyspec[] to_hostspec
    string    keyblob
    bool      key_is_ca

```

ssh-agent records each hop constraint against the key for later
permission checking. The hostnames in the constraint are used primarily
for hostname checking in certificate hostkeys (i.e. when key\_is\_ca is
true). The from\_hostname and from\_keyspec fields may be empty to signify
the origin host, but they are always mandatory for the to/through host.

### Building the forwarding path

The path visible to ssh-agent, from the origin through forwarding hosts
to a destination authentication request is established by ssh sending
a session binding message as the first message on an agent connection
after it is established. This message cryptographically links the SSH
connection's session identifier (as described in [RFC4253 section 7.2](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4253#section-7.2))
with the server's hostkey for the life of the agent connection. This
allows the agent to establish a trustworthy linkage between an agent
connection and a SSH connection.

The message format is:

```

byte            SSH_AGENTC_EXTENSION (0x1b)
string          session-bind@openssh.com
string          hostkey
string          session identifier
string          signature
bool            is_forwarding

```

Where the signature field is the server's signature over the session
identifier using its hostkey as sent in the final SSH2\_MSG\_KEXDH\_REPLY
/ SSH2\_MSG\_KEXECDH\_REPLY message of the initial client/server key
exchange. The is\_forwarding flag indicates whether this binding is for a
forwarding (true) or for an authentication attempt (false).

When the agent receives this message, it verifies the signature using
the included hostkey and checks that the session identifier has not been
previously recorded on this connection. If these checks pass, then the
hostkey and session id are appended to the connection's binding list.

When an agent connection is requested across a deep forwarding path,
extending beyond the origin host, each SSH client will issue a binding
request as soon as it has received confirmation of a successfully opened
channel, and before it passes the channel on to the next hop. This
ensures that the binding list will be extended in the correct order, and
that it is only necessary to trust each hop's SSH client to do its job
properly.

### Verifying an authentication attempt

To ensure that the agent has all the necessary information it needs to decide whether to allow an authentication attempt, the public key authentication request is extended to also include the server's host key:

```

byte            SSH2_MSG_USERAUTH_REQUEST
string          username
string          "ssh-connection"
string          "publickey-hostbound-v00@openssh.com"
bool            has_signature
string          pkalg
string          public key
string          server host key
string          signature [only if has_signature is true]

```

Apart from the addition of the server host key field, this request is identical to the usual
"publickey" authentication request described in [RFC4252](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc4252#section-7). When
an authentication attempt is made, the signature is made over the
concatenation of the connection's session identifier and the entire
SSH2\_MSG\_USERAUTH\_REQUEST packet (this unchanged from the standard SSH
protocol).

To make an authentication request using the agent, the client will
pass the data to be signed to the agent via a SSH2\_AGENTC\_SIGN\_REQUEST
message. ssh-agent can now attempt to parse the to-be-signed data and
extract the session identifier, server username and, thanks to the above
extension, server hostkey.

At this point, the agent has all the information it needs to strongly
identify the destination of an authentication request, and to relate
this to the binding list established during the previous step. The agent
will confirm that the signature request has been made along a permitted
forwarding path and to a permitted destination before completing it.

Inclusion of the hostkey in the signed data binds the signature to the
intended destination and prevents an attack where a MITM with access to
a hostkey for one permitted destination from signing session binding
requests for a different host.

Note that this hostkey binding is not required for the first-hop
connections, i.e. those originating from the host where the agent
is running. This allows non-transitive destination restrictions to
be useful to servers that do not support the host-bound signature
extension.

Support for host-bound signatures is signalled by the server to the
client using the SSH2\_MSG\_EXT\_INFO mechanism ([RFC8308](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc8308)) using the

### Fail-safe operation

This feature generally degrades safely (though not especially
gracefully) when hosts lack the necessary protocol extensions.

If the agent lacks destination constraint support, then attempting
to add a constrained key using ssh-add will fail because all key
constraints are treated as critical, i.e. failure of an agent to support
one will cause failure of the operation.

As mentioned above, host-bound signature support is not required on the
first hop, but if the agent parses an unbound authentication request on
a forwarded connection then the operation will be refused.

One case where the protocol does not degrade so gracefully is if access
to the ssh-agent is forwarded from the origin machine by tools that
do not participate in the session binding protocol, to a host where
the tools do support session binding. As per the previously discussed
[limitation](#pathtrust), this is entirely invisible to the agent and could yield
surprises. This situation is little contrived, but might occur if
an old OpenSSH or non-OpenSSH implementation is used concurrently on
the client machine and it is active in agent forwarding.

## Next steps

This is a new feature in OpenSSH and it is likely to evolve further.

More path information will likely be shown in key confirmation and FIDO
touch/PIN request dialogs in future.

There is currently no communication for the reason signature requests
and other operations are refused by ssh-agent except debug logs that are
not visible by default. This makes troubleshooting difficult.

The user-interface as presented by ssh-add might not be optimal for all
uses. In particular, users might want to specify whole forwarding chains
in a single argument. This was deliberately not implemented, as the
current hop-by-hop specification emphasises the delegatory aspect of hop
permissions, but it might be worth revisiting this.

The path information accrued in ssh-agent could be used for more
expressive and fine-grained control of key availability than is
currently implemented. E.g. it could be possible to make keys available
on hosts towards the end of a forwarding path and not on initial
hosts. Similarly, "wildcard" forwarding of keys through a particular
host could be added, as could selective relaxation of the need for
servers to support host-bound public key authentication. However, these
come with additional caveats and MITM risks that would need to be
assessed and explained carefully.

Finally, it may also be possible to selectively allow signing requests
other than those used for user authentication. SSH keys are being used
for a growing number of signing operations, including git commits and
pull requests. It may be possible, for example, to permit a key for
forwarded use only for git signing. However, all trust would be placed
on the forwarding path as there is no intrinsic destination binding
analogous to that offered by host-bound signatures.

## Alternatives considered

### Separate agent sockets

A previous design for agent restriction had the agent offering multiple
sockets, and gave ssh-add the ability to specify which of these sockets
that keys would be available on. In conjunction with the IdentityAgent
and ForwardAgent directives in ssh, this would give the ability to
make keys available for authentication to only specific hosts from the
origin, and to forward different subsets of keys to designated hosts.

However, this design required considerable manual configuration to
achieve this and offered no cryptographic guarantees of where keys could
be used.

### Changes to agent protocol only (i.e. no server-side changes)

A previous version of this protocol included only changes to the agent
protocol and did not include the host-bound authentication method. This
earlier design had the advantage of not requiring servers to update, but
suffered from the re-signing attack described [above](#pathtrust).

### Host-bound authentication and minimal agent protocol changes

Another potential variant of this protocol included the host-bound
authentication change, but removed the session binding mechanism. This
would allow the agent to strongly determine the destination of an
authentication request when it was made, but would give it no visibility
of the forwarding path over which it was made. This design was discarded
as offering too little control and of being too easy for a MITM to phish
requests against.

### Hop by hop signing

Another alternative design involved sshd in the protocol to a greater
extent, by having it sign forwarded agent messages it received with
its hostkey. This has the advantage of providing fresh signatures on
requests and avoids the path extension attack described [above](#pathtrust). However,
it requires that sshd interpret the agent protocol (currently it does
not), and risks creating an exposed hostkey signing oracle unless very
carefully designed.

### Host identification via name

This protocol uses hostkeys to identify hosts. It was suggested that,
with additional modifications to other parts of the SSH protocol,
hostnames could be used instead. Specifically, SSH servers could
assert a hostname during key exchange and these names could be
recorded in known\_hosts alongside the hostkey, rather than using
the destination hostname as entered by the user. Agent restrictions
could then potentially use these names instead of the more cumbersome
hostkeys. This option was not pursued as it would be a fairly
substantial modification to the SSH protocol, requiring modifications to
key exchange (or at least a new extension message) and hostkey storage.

## FAQ

Q: Is it possible to modify a key's constraints once it has been added?
A: No, keys are immutable in the agent. You can replace the key with a new path though.

## [About queries](#about-queries)

Every GraphQL schema has a root type for both queries and mutations. The [query type](https://spec.graphql.org/June2018/#sec-Type-System) defines GraphQL operations that retrieve data from the server.

For more information, see [Forming calls with GraphQL](/en/graphql/guides/forming-calls-with-graphql#about-queries).

Note

For GitHub App requests made with user access tokens, you should use separate queries for issues and pull requests. For example, use the `is:issue` or `is:pull-request` filters and their equivalents. Using the `search` connection to return a combination of issues and pull requests in a single query will result in an empty set of nodes.

# CVE-2021-36368

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2021-36222.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2021-36370.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-36368 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36368)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1978621#c0)  Przemyslaw Roguski    2021-07-02 10:29:30 UTC  ``` The openshift-service-ca service contains unexpected CAs. In OpenShift 4.8 the service-ca.crt file only contains the self-signed certificate of the openshift-service-serving-signer CA certificate. In older versions of OpenShift there were more, additional CAs: - OU = openshift, CN = kube-apiserver-lb-signer - OU = openshift, CN = kube-apiserver-localhost-signer - OU = openshift, CN = kube-apiserver-service-network-signer - CN = openshift-kube-apiserver-operator_localhost-recovery-serving-signer - CN = ingress-operator - CN = *.apps.cluster.example.com - CN = openshift-service-serving-signer   This means that an attacker who owns the ingress CA can impersonate as any in-cluster service-ca signed process. The issue impacts Confidentiality and Integrity of the OCP cluster.  OCP 4.8 is not impacted by this vulnerability.   ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=1978621#c5)  Sam Fowler    2021-07-13 06:00:41 UTC  ``` Fix:  <https://github.com/openshift/kubernetes/pull/714>   ```  [Comment 6](show_bug.cgi?id=1978621#c6)  Sam Fowler    2021-07-13 06:08:00 UTC  ``` In Kubernetes 1.21, which OpenShift 4.8 is based on, the method in which service accounts are mounted in pods changed, to now use projected volumes:  <https://kubernetes.io/docs/reference/access-authn-authz/service-accounts-admin/#bound-service-account-token-volume>  OpenShift rewrote the way service-ca.crt is injected into pods in 4.8, and now no longer includes the incorrect additional CAs.   ```  [Comment 7](show_bug.cgi?id=1978621#c7)  Sam Fowler    2021-07-13 06:13:48 UTC  ``` Below is a comparison of podspecs using the old and new methods of mounting service accounts into pods.

Vulnerable versions will include multiple internal CAs. This can be checked with a command like below:  $ openssl crl2pkcs7 -nocrl --certfile service-ca.crt  | openssl pkcs7 -print_certs --text -noout | grep 'CN='         Issuer: CN=ingress-operator@1626066148         Subject: CN=ingress-operator@1626066148         Issuer: CN=openshift-service-serving-signer@1626066048         Subject: CN=openshift-service-serving-signer@1626066048         ...   ```  [Comment 11](show_bug.cgi?id=1978621#c11)  errata-xmlrpc    2021-07-27 22:07:44 UTC  ``` This issue has been addressed in the following products:    Red Hat OpenShift Container Platform 4.8  Via RHSA-2021:2437 [https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021:2437](https://access.redhat.com/errata/RHSA-2021%3A2437)   ```  [Comment 12](show_bug.cgi?id=1978621#c12)  Product Security DevOps Team    2021-07-28 01:08:01 UTC  ``` This bug is now closed.

Based on <https://access.redhat.com/security/cve/cve-2021-3636>, it sounds like they are with the only resolution requiring version 4.8.

We are really looking for an answer as to whether we may get a fix or we will never get a fix.   ```  [Comment 17](show_bug.cgi?id=1978621#c17)  Sam Fowler    2021-11-02 03:29:23 UTC  ``` (In reply to Richard Theis from [comment #16](show_bug.cgi?id=1978621#c16)) > Does the support policy prevent such CVEs from being fixed?

Fixes for Moderate and Low CVEs can be requested by raising a support ticket.   ```  [Comment 18](show_bug.cgi?id=1978621#c18)  Richard Theis    2021-11-03 20:53:46 UTC  ``` Thank you.

# CVE-2021-36368

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2021-36222.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2021-36370.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-36368 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36368)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."

# CVE-2021-36368

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

[[Previous]](CVE-2021-36222.html) [[Index]](index.html) [[Next]](CVE-2021-36370.html)

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-36368 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36368)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."

# CVE-2021-36368

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-36368 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36368)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=3316#c0)  Manfred Kaiser (bmlv.gv.at)    2021-05-31 21:07:47 AEST  ``` I have done some research on the behavior of the second factor authentication (fido2) and ssh-askpass. Those methods can be used to confirm, when a private key is used by the agent.  By using the authentication method "none", which allows a client to login without credentials an attacker can bypass one of two required confirmations during a mitm attack.  Why is the ssh client and not the agent, fido 2 key or ssh-askpass affected? ----------------------------------------------------------------------------  When "none" authentication is used, the client does not need the agent to sign the data. This is the reason, why the user does not need to confirm the login with the fido 2 key or ssh-askpass.   Scenario --------  I want to connect to a development server with public key authentication and agent forwarding enabled, which is needed, if I want to access an internal git repo or another server from this machine.  The server got compromised and the attacker has access to the forwarded agent.   This is the same scenario as by the Matrix server hack in 2019.  Another scenario is remote copy of files. I want to connect to a remote machine with scp or sftp to copy one file to another server. New implementations of openssh (>8.4) supports agent forwarding in scp and sftp, which makes this attack also possible.   Normal behavior -----------------  When I connect to the dev server with public key authentication, I have to push the button on my fido 2 device.  The attacker got access to my forwarded agent and uses this agent to get access to another server. This does not work, because I need to push the button an my fido 2 device.  This is not expected and I will close the session an inform my administrator of a compromised server.   Bypass of fido 2 devices and ssh-askpass ----------------------------------------  If you configure your ssh server, so it does not need credentials to login (none authentication), an attacker can bypass the first confirmation for the fido 2 device or ssh-askpass.  This can be done, by using the authentication method "none".  If the client connects to the compromised server, the server accepts the connection and requests the agent.  After the attacker got the agent, the attacker can try to login to a different server, which will need a confirmation on the fido 2 device.  The user thinks, that this confirmation is for the development server, because he does not know, that he is already connected. After the confirmation, the attacker is logged in to the other server.   Suggestion mitigation ---------------------  The main problem is the none authentication. If the server does not allow none authentication, this bypass is not possible.  Removing the "none" authentication from the openssh server does not mitigate this bypass, because an attacker can use another server or patch it to the old behavior.  The client can warn, if "none" authentication was successful are close the connection, in a more restrict mode.  Perhaps an optional parameter "e.g. --disable-none" can be added. Default value is the old behavior, where "none" authentication is allowed. When the user wants to disable "none" authentication, he can use the new parameter.   Note:   We are talking about high security use cases where agent forwarding is needed. If you don't use a fido 2 key, a mitm attack becomes far easier and does not require such a bypass.  Of course, one can argue, that agent forwarding is a bad practice, but there are still some use cases. For example pulling a repo on a dev machine from a git server. ```  [Comment 1](show_bug.cgi?id=3316#c1)  Damien Miller    2021-06-04 13:17:08 AEST  ``` First, the root cause is forwarding an agent to an attacker-controlled destination - the user is effectively delegating use of their keys to that attacker.  Second this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed. The user is becoming confused as to the context of a FIDO touch request. That makes this more like phishing than anything else.  This attack may be mitigated by setting LogLevel=verbose so ssh(1) will print a message at the conclusion of authentication:  > [djm@origin ~]$ ssh -oLogLevel=verbose host > Authenticated to host.example.com ([10.0.0.1]:22). > $  Fundamentally, forwarding an agent is a risky operation and should be avoided where possible. This is why we implemented ProxyJump :) ```  [Comment 2](show_bug.cgi?id=3316#c2)  Manfred Kaiser (bmlv.gv.at)    2022-03-10 19:39:37 AEDT  ``` OpenSSH 8.9 added "agent restrictions", which should prevent such attacks. Thanks for implementing the new feature :-D  I think this issue ticket can be closed. ```  [Comment 3](show_bug.cgi?id=3316#c3)  Manfred Kaiser (bmlv.gv.at)    2022-03-11 00:49:50 AEDT  ``` * Information about "agent restriction": <https://www.openssh.com/agent-restrict.html> * Full disclosure: <https://docs.ssh-mitm.at/trivialauth.html>  Note: I will update the full disclosure to reflect the new feature of OpenSSH 8.9. ```  [Comment 4](show_bug.cgi?id=3316#c4)  Manfred Kaiser (bmlv.gv.at)    2022-03-11 01:20:39 AEDT  ``` CVE-2021-36368 was reserved for this vulnerability. ```  [Comment 5](show_bug.cgi?id=3316#c5)  Damien Miller    2022-04-08 12:12:53 AEST  ``` closing bug resolved during openssh-9.0 release cycle ``` |  |

# Understanding GitHub Code Search syntax

You can build search queries for the results you want with specialized code qualifiers, regular expressions, and boolean operations.

## In this article

* [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)
* [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)
* [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)
* [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

* [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)
## [About code search query structure](#about-code-search-query-structure)

The search syntax in this article only applies to searching code with GitHub code search. Note that the syntax and qualifiers for searching for non-code content, such as issues, users, and discussions, is not the same as the syntax for code search. For more information on non-code search, see [About searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/getting-started-with-searching-on-github/about-searching-on-github) and [Searching on GitHub](/en/search-github/searching-on-github).

Search queries consist of search terms, comprising text you want to search for, and qualifiers, which narrow down the search.

A bare term with no qualifiers will match either the content of a file or the file's path.

For example, the following query:

```
http-push

```

The above query will match the file `docs/http-push.txt`, even if it doesn't contain the term `http-push`. It will also match a file called `example.txt` if it contains the term `http-push`.

You can enter multiple terms separated by whitespace to search for documents that satisfy both terms.

For example, the following query:

```
sparse index

```

The search results would include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order. As examples, it would match a file containing `SparseIndexVector`, a file with the phrase `index for sparse trees`, and even a file named `index.txt` that contains the term `sparse`.

Searching for multiple terms separated by whitespace is the equivalent to the search `hello AND world`. Other boolean operations, such as `hello OR world`, are also supported. For more information about boolean operations, see [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations).

Code search also supports searching for an exact string, including whitespace. For more information, see [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match).

You can narrow your code search with specialized qualifiers, such as `repo:`, `language:` and `path:`. For more information on the qualifiers you can use in code search, see [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers).

You can also use regular expressions in your searches by surrounding the expression in slashes. For more information on using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Query for an exact match](#query-for-an-exact-match)

To search for an exact string, including whitespace, you can surround the string in quotes. For example:

```
"sparse index"

```

You can also use quoted strings in qualifiers, for example:

```
path:git language:"protocol buffers"

```
## [Searching for quotes and backslashes](#searching-for-quotes-and-backslashes)

To search for code containing a quotation mark, you can escape the quotation mark using a backslash. For example, to find the exact string `name = "tensorflow"`, you can search:

```
"name = \"tensorflow\""

```

To search for code containing a backslash, `\`, use a double backslash, `\\`.

The two escape sequences `\\` and `\"` can be used outside of quotes as well. No other escape sequences are recognized, though. A backslash that isn't followed by either `"` or `\` is included in the search, unchanged.

Additional escape sequences, such as `\n` to match a newline character, are supported in regular expressions. See [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

## [Using boolean operations](#using-boolean-operations)

Code search supports boolean expressions. You can use the operators `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT` to combine search terms.

By default, adjacent terms separated by whitespace are equivalent to using the `AND` operator. For example, the search query `sparse index` is the same as `sparse AND index`, meaning that the search results will include all documents containing both the terms `sparse` and `index`, in any order.

To search for documents containing either one term or the other, you can use the `OR` operator. For example, the following query will match documents containing either `sparse` or `index`:

```
sparse OR index

```

To exclude files from your search results, you can use the `NOT` operator. For example, to exclude files in the `__testing__` directory, you can search:

```
"fatal error" NOT path:__testing__

```

You can use parentheses to express more complicated boolean expressions. For example:

```
(language:ruby OR language:python) AND NOT path:"/tests/"

```
## [Using qualifiers](#using-qualifiers)

You can use specialized keywords to qualify your search.

* [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)
* [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)
* [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)
* [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)
* [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)
* [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)
* [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

### [Repository qualifier](#repository-qualifier)

To search within a repository, use the `repo:` qualifier. You must provide the full repository name, including the owner. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist

```

To search within a set of repositories, you can combine multiple `repo:` qualifiers with the boolean operator `OR`. For example:

```
repo:github-linguist/linguist OR repo:tree-sitter/tree-sitter

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for repository names, so you will have to type the entire repository name (including the user prefix) for the `repo:` qualifier to work.

### [Organization and user qualifiers](#organization-and-user-qualifiers)

To search for files within an organization, use the `org:` qualifier. For example:

```
org:github

```

To search for files within a personal account, use the `user:` qualifier. For example:

```
user:octocat

```

Note

Code search does not currently support regular expressions or partial matching for organization or user names, so you will have to type the entire organization or user name for the qualifier to work.

### [Language qualifier](#language-qualifier)

To narrow down to a specific languages, use the `language:` qualifier. For example:

```
language:ruby OR language:cpp OR language:csharp

```

For a complete list of supported language names, see [languages.yaml](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist/blob/main/lib/linguist/languages.yml) in [github-linguist/linguist](https://github.com/github-linguist/linguist). If your preferred language is not on the list, you can open a pull request to add it.

### [Path qualifier](#path-qualifier)

To search within file paths, use the `path:` qualifier. This will match files containing the term anywhere in their file path. For example, to find files containing the term `unit_tests` in their path, use:

```
path:unit_tests

```

The above query will match both `src/unit_tests/my_test.py` and `src/docs/unit_tests.md` since they both contain `unit_test` somewhere in their path.

To match only a specific filename (and not part of the path), you could use a regular expression:

```
path:/(^|\/)README\.md$/

```

Note that the `.` in the filename is escaped, since `.` has special meaning for regular expressions. For more information about using regular expressions, see [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions).

You can also use some limited glob expressions in the `path:` qualifier.

For example, to search for files with the extension `txt`, you can use:

```
path:*.txt

```

To search for JavaScript files within a `src` directory, you could use:
```
path:src/*.js

```

* By default, glob expressions are not anchored to the start of the path, so the above expression would still match a path like `app/src/main.js`. But if you prefix the expression with `/`, it will anchor to the start. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/*.js

  ```
* Note that `*` doesn't match the `/` character, so for the above example, all results will be direct descendants of the `src` directory. To match within subdirectories, so that results include deeply nested files such as `/src/app/testing/utils/example.js`, you can use `**`. For example:

  ```
  path:/src/**/*.js

  ```

You can also use the `?` global character. For example, to match the path `file.aac` or `file.abc`, you can use:

```
path:*.a?c

```

To search for a filename which contains a special character like `\*` or `?`, just use a quoted string:
```
path:"file?"

```

Glob expressions are disabled for quoted strings, so the above query will only match paths containing the literal string `file?`.

### [Symbol qualifier](#symbol-qualifier)

You can search for symbol definitions in code, such as function or class definitions, using the `symbol:` qualifier. Symbol search is based on parsing your code using the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, so no extra setup or build tool integration is required.

For example, to search for a symbol called `WithContext`:

```
language:go symbol:WithContext

```

In some languages, you can search for symbols using a prefix (e.g. a prefix of their class name). For example, for a method `deleteRows` on a struct `Maint`, you could search `symbol:Maint.deleteRows` if you are using Go, or `symbol:Maint::deleteRows` in Rust.

You can also use regular expressions with the symbol qualifier. For example, the following query would find conversions people have implemented in Rust for the `String` type:

```
language:rust symbol:/^String::to_.*/

```

Note that this qualifier only searches for definitions and not references, and not all symbol types or languages are fully supported yet. Symbol extraction is supported for the following languages:

* Bash
* C
* C#
* C++
* CodeQL
* Elixir
* Go
* JSX
* Java
* JavaScript
* Lua
* PHP
* Protocol Buffers
* Python
* R
* Ruby
* Rust
* Scala
* Starlark
* Swift
* Typescript

We are working on adding support for more languages. If you would like to help contribute to this effort, you can add support for your language in the open source [Tree-sitter](https://github.com/tree-sitter) parser ecosystem, upon which symbol search is based.

### [Content qualifier](#content-qualifier)

By default, bare terms search both paths and file content. To restrict a search to strictly match the content of a file and not file paths, use the `content:` qualifier. For example:

```
content:README.md

```

This query would only match files containing the term `README.md`, rather than matching files named `README.md`.

### [Is qualifier](#is-qualifier)

To filter based on repository properties, you can use the `is:` qualifier. `is:` supports the following values:

* `archived`: restricts the search to archived repositories.
* `fork`: restricts the search to forked repositories.
* `vendored`: restricts the search to content detected as vendored.
* `generated`: restricts the search to content detected as generated.

For example:

```
path:/^MIT.txt$/ is:archived

```

Note that the `is:` qualifier can be inverted with the `NOT` operator. To search for non-archived repositories, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:archived

```

To exclude forks from your results, you can search:

```
log4j NOT is:fork

```
## [Using regular expressions](#using-regular-expressions)

Code search supports regular expressions to search for patterns in your code. You can use regular expressions in bare search terms as well as within many qualifiers, by surrounding the regex in slashes.

For example, to search for the regular expression `sparse.*index`, you would use:

```
/sparse.*index/

```

Note that you'll have to escape any forward slashes within the regular expression. For example, to search for files within the `App/src` directory, you would use:

```
/^App\/src\//

```

Inside a regular expression, `\n` stands for a newline character, `\t` stands for a tab, and `\x{hhhh}` can be used to escape any Unicode character. This means you can use regular expressions to search for exact strings that contain characters that you can't type into the search bar.

Most common regular expressions features work in code search. However, "look-around" assertions are not supported.

## [Separating search terms](#separating-search-terms)

All parts of a search, such as search terms, exact strings, regular expressions, qualifiers, parentheses, and the boolean keywords `AND`, `OR`, and `NOT`, must be separated from one another with spaces. The one exception is that items inside parentheses, `(` `)`, don't need to be separated from the parentheses.

If your search contains multiple components that aren't separated by spaces, or other text that does not follow the rules listed above, code search will try to guess what you mean. It often falls back on treating that component of your query as the exact text to search for. For example, the following query:

```
printf("hello world\n");

```

Code search will give up on interpreting the parentheses and quotes as special characters and will instead search for files containing that exact code.

If code search guesses wrong, you can always get the search you wanted by using quotes and spaces to make the meaning clear.

## [Case sensitivity](#case-sensitivity)

By default, code search is case-insensitive, and results will include both uppercase and lowercase results. You can do case-sensitive searches by using a regular expression with case insensitivity turned off. For example, to search for the string "True", you would use:

```
/(?-i)True/

```

# CVE-2021-36368

## Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures

### Upstream information

[CVE-2021-36368 at MITRE](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36368)

#### Description

\*\* DISPUTED \*\* An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."

This is an improvement, but is to complicated and inconvenient to mitigate it. This is the reason, why I have updated my pull request to the latest master. |

# CVE-2021-36368

| **Name** | CVE-2021-36368 |
| --- | --- |
| **Description** | An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed. |

Version Effective Date: December 18, 2024

When you use GitHub, you may be given access to lots of additional products and features ("Additional Products and Features"). Because many of the Additional Products and Features offer different functionality, your Agreement with us (the "Agreement") includes the specific terms for that product or feature combined with your main agreement — the GitHub Terms of Service or GitHub Customer Agreement, or the GitHub Corporate Terms of Service or other legacy GitHub contract, or a Microsoft volume licensing agreement. Below, we've listed those products and features, along with the corresponding additional terms that apply to your use of them.

By using the Additional Products and Features, you also agree to the applicable GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features listed below. A violation of these GitHub Terms for Additional Products and Features is a violation of the Agreement. Capitalized terms not defined here have the meaning given in the Agreement.

* **GitHub Enterprise Cloud** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Codespaces, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages, and Pages.
* **GitHub Enterprise Server** users may have access to the following Additional Products and Features: Actions, Advanced Security, Advisory Database, Connect, Dependabot Preview, GitHub Enterprise Importer, Packages, Pages, and SQL Server Images.

## [Actions](#actions)

GitHub Actions enables you to create custom software development lifecycle workflows directly in your GitHub repository. Actions is billed on a usage basis. The [Actions documentation](/en/actions) includes details, including compute and storage quantities (depending on your Account plan), and how to monitor your Actions minutes usage and set usage limits.

Actions and any elements of the Actions product or service may not be used in violation of the Agreement, the [GitHub Acceptable Use Policies](/en/site-policy/acceptable-use-policies/github-acceptable-use-policies), or the GitHub Actions service limitations set forth in the [Actions documentation](/en/actions/learn-github-actions/usage-limits-billing-and-administration). Additionally, regardless of whether an Action is using self-hosted runners, Actions should not be used for:

* Cryptomining;
* Disrupting, gaining, or attempting to gain unauthorized access to, any service, device, data, account, or network (other than those authorized by the [GitHub Bug Bounty program](https://bounty.github.com));
* The provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering the Actions product or service, or any elements of the Actions product or service, for commercial purposes;
* Any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Actions as a content delivery network or as part of a serverless application, but a low benefit Action could be ok if it’s also low burden); or
* If using GitHub-hosted runners, any other activity unrelated to the production, testing, deployment, or publication of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Actions are used.

In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Actions, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Actions. Misuse of GitHub Actions may result in termination of jobs, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Actions, disabling of repositories created to run Actions in a way that violates these Terms, or in some cases, suspension or termination of your GitHub account.

*Use for Development and Testing*

You may only access and use GitHub Actions to develop and test your application(s). Only one licensed user may access a virtual machine provided by Actions at any time.

*Authorized Developer*

You appoint GitHub as your authorized developer with respect to Apple software included in Actions. GitHub is responsible for complying with the terms for any such software included in Actions and will keep confidential any confidential information of Apple accessed as part of Actions.

*Third Party Repository Service Access*

If you grant GitHub access to your third-party repository service account(s), you authorize GitHub to scan the account(s), including the contents of your Public and Private Repositories, for purposes of providing GitHub Actions.

*Self-Hosted Runners on GitHub Actions*

If you use self-hosted runners, you have the ability to turn off automatic updates but GitHub reserves the right to override your choice for critical security updates.

## [Advanced Security](#advanced-security)

GitHub makes extra security features available to customers under an Advanced Security license. These features include code scanning, secret scanning, and dependency review. The [Advanced Security documentation](/en/get-started/learning-about-github/about-github-advanced-security) provides more details.

Advanced Security is licensed on a "Unique Committer" basis. A "Unique Committer" is a licensed user of GitHub Enterprise, GitHub Enterprise Cloud, or GitHub Enterprise Server, who has made a commit in the last 90 days to any repository with any GitHub Advanced Security functionality activated. You must acquire a GitHub Advanced Security User license for each of your Unique Committers. You may only use GitHub Advanced Security on codebases that are developed by or for you. For GitHub Enterprise Cloud users, some Advanced Security features also require the use of GitHub Actions.

For secret scanning with GitHub Advanced Security, when you opt-in to automatic validity checks for partner patterns, exposed third-party tokens may be shared with the relevant partner, in order to provide you with more information about the validity of the token. Not all partners are based in the United States. The [Secret scanning patterns documentation](/en/enterprise-cloud%40latest/code-security/secret-scanning/introduction/supported-secret-scanning-patterns) provides more details on which partners support the validity check.

## [Advisory Database](#advisory-database)

The GitHub Advisory Database allows you to browse or search for vulnerabilities that affect open source projects on GitHub.

*License Grant to Us*

We need the legal right to submit your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database into public domain datasets such as the [National Vulnerability Database](https://nvd.nist.gov/) and to license the GitHub Advisory Database under open terms for use by security researchers, the open source community, industry, and the public. You agree to release your contributions to the GitHub Advisory Database under the [Creative Commons Zero license](https://creativecommons.org/publicdomain/zero/1.0/).

*License to the GitHub Advisory Database*

The GitHub Advisory Database is licensed under the [Creative Commons Attribution 4.0 license](https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/). The attribution term may be fulfilled by linking to the GitHub Advisory Database at <https://github.com/advisories> or to individual GitHub Advisory Database records used, prefixed by <https://github.com/advisories>.

## [Codespaces](#codespaces)

*Note: The github.dev service, available by pressing . on a repo or navigating directly to github.dev, is governed by GitHub's Beta Terms of service.*

GitHub Codespaces enables you to develop code directly from your browser using the code within your GitHub repository. Codespaces and any elements of the Codespaces service may not be used in violation of the Agreement or the Acceptable Use Policies. Additionally, Codespaces should not be used for:

* Cryptomining;
* Using our servers to disrupt, or to gain or to attempt to gain unauthorized access to any service, device, data, account or network (other than those authorized by the GitHub Bug Bounty program);
* The provision of a stand-alone or integrated application or service offering Codespaces or any elements of Codespaces for commercial purposes;
* Any activity that places a burden on our servers, where that burden is disproportionate to the benefits provided to users (for example, don't use Codespaces as a content delivery network, as part of a serverless application, or to host any kind of production-facing application); or
* Any other activity unrelated to the development or testing of the software project associated with the repository where GitHub Codespaces is initiated.

In order to prevent violations of these limitations and abuse of GitHub Codespaces, GitHub may monitor your use of GitHub Codespaces. Misuse of GitHub Codespaces may result in termination of your access to Codespaces, restrictions in your ability to use GitHub Codespaces, or the disabling of repositories created to run Codespaces in a way that violates these Terms.

Codespaces allows you to load extensions from the Microsoft Visual Studio Marketplace (“Marketplace Extensions”) for use in your development environment, for example, to process the programming languages that your code is written in. Marketplace Extensions are licensed under their own separate terms of use as noted in the Visual Studio Marketplace, and the terms of use located at <https://aka.ms/vsmarketplace-ToU>. GitHub makes no warranties of any kind in relation to Marketplace Extensions and is not liable for actions of third-party authors of Marketplace Extensions that are granted access to Your Content. Codespaces also allows you to load software into your environment through devcontainer features. Such software is provided under the separate terms of use accompanying it. Your use of any third-party applications is at your sole risk.

The generally available version of Codespaces is not currently available for U.S. government customers. U.S. government customers may continue to use the Codespaces Beta Preview under separate terms. See [Beta Preview terms](/en/site-policy/github-terms/github-terms-of-service#j-beta-previews).

## [Competitive Benchmarking](#competitive-benchmarking)

If you offer a product or service competitive to any GitHub product or service, by using that GitHub product or service, you agree to and hereby waive any restrictions as to GitHub on competitive use and benchmark testing in the terms governing your competitive product or service. If you do not intend to waive such restrictions in your terms of use, you are not allowed to use that GitHub product or service.

## [Connect](#connect)

With GitHub Connect, you can share certain features and data between your GitHub Enterprise Server deployment and your GitHub Enterprise Cloud organization or enterprise account on GitHub.com. In order to enable GitHub Connect, you must have at least one (1) account on GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com, and one (1) licensed deployment of GitHub Enterprise Server. Your use of GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com through Connect is governed by the terms under which you license GitHub Enterprise Cloud or GitHub.com. Use of Personal Data is governed by the [GitHub Privacy Statement](/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-privacy-statement).

## [GitHub Copilot](#github-copilot)

For GitHub Copilot Business and Copilot Enterprise license holders, your use of GitHub Copilot is governed by the [GitHub Copilot Product Specific Terms](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-copilot-product-specific-terms).

## [GitHub Enterprise Importer](#github-enterprise-importer)

Importer is a framework for exporting data from other sources to be imported to the GitHub platform. Importer is provided “AS-IS”.

## [npm](#npm)

npm is a software package hosting service that allows you to host your software packages privately or publicly and use packages as dependencies in your projects. npm is the registry of record for the JavaScript ecosystem. The npm public registry is free to use but customers are billed if they want to publish private packages or manage private packages using teams. The [npm documentation](https://docs.npmjs.com/) includes details about the limitation of account types and how to manage [private packages](https://docs.npmjs.com/about-private-packages) and [organizations](https://docs.npmjs.com/organizations). Acceptable use of the npm registry is outlined in the [open-source terms](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/open-source-terms). There are supplementary terms for both the npm [solo](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/solo-plan) and [org](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/orgs-plan) plans. The npm [Terms of Use](https://www.npmjs.com/policies/terms) apply to your use of npm.

If your Agreement does not include terms and conditions that address Previews, then the following terms apply. GitHub grants a limited right to use a non-production instance of the Preview. Previews are provided “AS-IS”, “WITH ALL FAULTS” and “AS AVAILABLE”. GitHub may change or discontinue Previews at any time without notice. Any information we give you about a private Preview will be considered GitHub’s confidential information. If you choose to provide comments or suggestions about a Preview, we may use that feedback for any purpose without obligation of any kind. GitHub’s maximum liability is limited to direct damages up to US $500. GitHub has no obligation to defend, indemnify, or hold you harmless for claims brought by third parties arising from your use of Previews.

### `npx fka`

Hello, this is **Fatih Kadir Akın**

I'm a passionate **software developer** living in **Istanbul, Turkey**, working for [Teknasyon](https://teknasyon.com) as the **DevRel Manager**.
I **wrote a book** about **JavaScript**. I love being part of development of web technologies. I like to **organize conferences and give talks**.
I love **open source development** and I build things on my GitHub profile (here).
I love **JavaScript** and **Ruby (and RoR)**.
