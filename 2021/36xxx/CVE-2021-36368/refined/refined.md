**1. Verification of CVE Relevance**

The content directly relates to CVE-2021-36368, with multiple sources referencing the CVE ID and providing descriptions that match the official CVE description:

> An issue was discovered in OpenSSH before 8.9. If a client is using public-key authentication with agent forwarding but without -oLogLevel=verbose, and an attacker has silently modified the server to support the None authentication option, then the user cannot determine whether FIDO authentication is going to confirm that the user wishes to connect to that server, or that the user wishes to allow that server to connect to a different server on the user's behalf. NOTE: the vendor's position is "this is not an authentication bypass, since nothing is being bypassed."

**2. Vulnerability Details**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of user awareness when using agent forwarding in OpenSSH. Specifically, when a client is configured to use public-key authentication with agent forwarding but does *not* use `-oLogLevel=verbose`, and the server has been modified to support the `None` authentication option, the user cannot distinguish if their FIDO authentication is for connecting to the server or for allowing the server to connect to another server on their behalf. The core issue is the ambiguity introduced by the `None` authentication method.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The primary vulnerability is a lack of user awareness and the potential for confusion arising from the "None" authentication method in conjunction with agent forwarding. There is no authentication bypass.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker, having compromised a server and modified it to support "None" authentication, can leverage a forwarded agent to connect to other servers. The impact is the potential to trick the user into authenticating access to another server through the compromised server. This vulnerability is a form of phishing.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   A compromised server.
    *   Agent forwarding enabled on the client.
    *   The client *not* using `-oLogLevel=verbose`.
    *   The compromised server modified to support the "None" authentication option.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   Ability to compromise a server that the user connects to.
    *   Ability to modify the server to support the "None" authentication option.
    *   Ability to receive forwarded agent connections.

**3. Additional Information**

*   **Vendor's Position:**  The vendor (OpenSSH developers) dispute that this is an "authentication bypass", stating that nothing is actually bypassed and that the user's confusion about the context of FIDO authentication is the core issue.
*  **Mitigation:**
    *   Using `LogLevel=verbose` provides additional information to the user about the authentication context
    *  Disabling `None` authentication on the server.
    *   Avoid using agent forwarding or use the `ProxyJump` directive to avoid forwarding.
*   **SUSE's Assessment:** SUSE has rated this issue as low severity and marked it as resolved, acknowledging that it is not an authentication bypass.

*   **Red Hat's Assessment**: Red Hat classifies this vulnerability as "Not a Bug", with an advisory that it does not bypass authentication, rather it misleads the user with an unclear FIDO touch request.

*   **OpenSSH Fix**: OpenSSH 8.9 implements a fix via "agent restrictions" by adding a new protocol extension to control how and where keys in ssh-agent may be used and provide users with more information about the context of FIDO touch requests.

| **Root Cause**              | Lack of user awareness when agent forwarding is used with `None` authentication on a modified server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |
| **Vulnerabilities**        | User confusion and potential phishing due to the ability for a compromised server using "None" authentication to hijack an agent to authenticate to other servers.   |
| **Impact**                 | Attackers can trick users into authenticating with a FIDO key to a remote server using a compromised intermediary server.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **Attack Vector**            |  Compromised server, agent forwarding enabled, no verbose logging, and server configured for None authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **Attacker Capabilities**  | Must compromise a server and have the ability to modify the server to support None authentication. Access to a forwarded agent connection from the client is needed to perform the attack.                                                                                                               |
| **Mitigation**              |  Using `-oLogLevel=verbose` on the client,  disabling `None` authentication,  avoiding agent forwarding, using `ProxyJump`, using OpenSSH >=8.9 and enforcing client-side agent key restrictions.   |
| **Vendor Stance**           | The vendor doesn't see it as a bypass, but as a misrepresentation of the authentication context.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **SUSE Stance**             |   Low severity, resolved.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **Red Hat Stance**             |   Not a bug.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |
| **OpenSSH Fix**      | The implementation of "agent restrictions" which include session binding, and host bound authentication.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
