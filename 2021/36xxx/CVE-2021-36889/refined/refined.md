Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36889:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient sanitization of user-supplied input within the `tarteaucitron.js` WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The plugin is vulnerable to both stored and persistent XSS. This means that malicious scripts can be injected and stored in the plugin's settings and then executed whenever users visit the affected website.
- **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The root cause lies in the failure to properly sanitize or encode user input before displaying it on the web page.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Script Injection:** Attackers can inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the website.
- **Website Compromise:** This malicious script can be used for various purposes, such as:
    - Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    - Displaying unwanted advertisements.
    - Stealing user cookies and session data.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the user.
    - Defacing the website

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker would require administrative privileges to modify the plugin's settings, or inject the malicious script via other vulnerable inputs.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with administrator-level access to the WordPress site's backend to exploit the persistent XSS vulnerability described by Patchstack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The Patchstack content mentions that the issue is a "low priority" due to low exploitability.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 1.6.1 of the plugin.
- The changelog of the plugin also mentions a fix for "Multiple Authenticated (Admin+) Persistent XSS" in version 1.6.1, which is likely referring to this issue.
- The patchstack also indicates the vulnerability was reported by Ex.Mi.
