Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is due to an "Access of Memory Location After End of Buffer," which corresponds to CWE-788. This indicates a buffer overflow or similar memory access error where the software attempts to read or write data beyond the allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
-  A memory corruption vulnerability (CWE-788) exists, specifically an access of memory location after the end of a buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to arbitrary code execution within the context of the current user. This means an attacker could potentially gain control of the affected system, execute malicious code, install malware, access sensitive data, etc.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L). This means the attacker needs local access to the system, potentially by using a maliciously crafted file that is processed by the vulnerable software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have local access (AV:L) to the machine. User interaction (UI:R) is required, which means the victim has to perform some action like opening or processing a crafted malicious file to trigger the vulnerability. No privileges are required (PR:N).

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is categorized as critical with a CVSS base score of 7.8.
- The content mentions the vulnerability is present in Adobe Media Encoder version 15.4 and earlier.
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 15.4.1.
- The vulnerability is also listed alongside CVE-2021-46818 and CVE-2021-46817, which have the same vulnerability details.
