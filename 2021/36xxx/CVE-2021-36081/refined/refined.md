Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36081:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability is a heap-use-after-free, which occurs in the `__libcpp_strpbrk` function.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-use-after-free: This indicates a memory management issue where a program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, leading to a crash or potential exploitation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The primary impact is a crash, as indicated in the provided details. It could also be potentially exploitable for arbitrary code execution, although the provided data does not confirm this.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The specific attack vector isn't detailed in the provided text, but it is triggered within the `tesseract::Tesseract::one_ell_conflict` function, which is part of the tesseract-ocr library.
- The vulnerability is triggered when processing input that causes the `__libcpp_strpbrk` to be called with freed memory.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to provide a specific input that can trigger the vulnerable code path within Tesseract.
- It would likely require the attacker to have the ability to influence the input processed by Tesseract.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was identified by OSS-Fuzz, a Google project for finding vulnerabilities.
- The issue was introduced with commit `4043204c2b418994475f6f09332363427b2702e7` and fixed with commit `e6f15621c2ab2ecbfabf656942d8ef66f03b2d55` and  `91b2b4f4a08d4693b02838636c53a2af93397138`.
- The vulnerability exists within the tesseract-ocr package, specifically versions up to 5.0.0-alpha-20201231
