Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36750:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the flawed key derivation function used in the SanDisk SecureAccess software (also used by Sony and Lexar products). Specifically:

1.  **Predictable Salt:** The software used a hardcoded, constant salt for the PBKDF2 key derivation function. This means that the same salt was used for all users, making it easier to create reusable password cracking resources.
2.  **Insufficient Iterations:** The software used PBKDF2 with only 1000 iterations of MD5. This is computationally weak and allows for practical brute-force attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Weak Key Derivation Function:** The combination of a constant salt and low iteration count in PBKDF2 with MD5 made the password hash easily crackable.
*   **Lack of Data Integrity:** The encryption method was malleable and lacked integrity checks, allowing for undetected modification of encrypted data. The encryption uses a CTR-like construction with AES-128, but chaining multiple encryptions with key-derived IVs does not increase security beyond 128 bits.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** Attackers could brute-force user passwords, gaining access to sensitive data stored in encrypted vaults.
*   **Data Modification:** The malleable encryption allowed attackers to modify encrypted data without detection.
*   **Widespread Vulnerability:** Due to the use of the same vulnerable software across multiple vendors (Sony, SanDisk, and Lexar) and some libraries, the vulnerability had widespread implications.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Dictionary Attacks:** Due to the predictable salt, attackers could use dictionary attacks or rainbow tables to crack user passwords.
*   **Brute-Force Attacks:** The low iteration count in the key derivation function made brute-force attacks feasible.
*  **Malleability Attacks:** The lack of data integrity allows modifying encrypted data without detection

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs access to the encrypted vault file.
*   The attacker needs computational resources sufficient for password cracking and has to know about the vulnerabilities in the key derivation function.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The presentation mentioned releasing a John the Ripper plugin to facilitate brute-force attacks.
*   Western Digital (which owns SanDisk) released an update (SanDisk PrivateAccess Version 6.3.5) that addresses the issues by using PBKDF2-SHA256 with a randomly generated salt.
*   The vulnerability was reported by Sylvain Pelissier.
*   The original software claimed "Ultimate encryption using 1024 bit AES keys Military grade" which was not the case.
