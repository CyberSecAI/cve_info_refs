Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-36016

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds read error during the parsing of FLV files. This is due to a lack of proper input validation of user-supplied data, which can cause the software to read past the end of an allocated buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **CWE-125:** Out-of-bounds Read

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Memory leak (as reported by Adobe).**
*   **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability allows attackers to disclose sensitive information by reading data beyond the allocated buffer.
*   **Potential for Arbitrary Code Execution:** The ZDI advisory notes that this vulnerability can be leveraged in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. However, Adobe does not mention arbitrary code execution, it only states that the vulnerability leads to "Memory Leak".

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Malicious File:** An attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious FLV file that, when parsed by the application, triggers the out-of-bounds read.
*  **Malicious Web Page:** The ZDI advisory states that a user interaction is required for exploitation, in that the target must visit a malicious page or open a malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to get the target user to open a specially crafted FLV file.
*   User interaction is required in order to open the malicious file or visit a malicious page.
*   The attacker could be a remote attacker given the use of malicious files.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "Moderate" with a CVSS score of 3.3 according to Adobe and ZDI.
*   Adobe categorizes the vulnerability's impact as a memory leak.
*   ZDI mentions that an attacker could leverage the vulnerability in conjunction with other vulnerabilities to execute arbitrary code.
*  The vulnerability affects Adobe Media Encoder 15.2 and earlier versions on Windows.
*   Adobe released version 15.4 to address the vulnerability.
