- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Dell EMC Streaming Data Platform has a Server-Side Request Forgery vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Server Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A remote unauthenticated attacker can exploit the vulnerability to perform port scanning of internal networks and make HTTP requests to an arbitrary domain controlled by the attacker. This can lead to the exposure of internal network information and potential further attacks.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote unauthenticated network access. The attacker crafts malicious requests that force the vulnerable server to make requests to other servers, potentially internal to the network.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the affected Dell EMC Streaming Data Platform server. No prior authentication is required.
