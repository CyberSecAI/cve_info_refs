it works perfect. make sure you are not logged-in at wordpress admin to view the changes at front end. always use another browser or incognito window of your browser to see the live version. this is usually most of the people make mistake.

I based my entire relaunch around this plug in. Unfortunately it did not work AT ALL. And yes, I did set it up correctly. The plug in even said, “Launcher enabled.” I uninstalled and reinstalled numerous times and it simply did not work. I was on a tight schedule and this already set me back so I went with a different, nowhere near as nice looking, product. I had tested it and it had worked previously, but when push came to shove… nope. Would not turn on. Not with a private browser, not even with people from across the country trying it. Just.. nothing.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
