Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36348:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by an input injection flaw in Dell EMC iDRAC9. This means the iDRAC software does not properly sanitize or validate user-supplied input before processing it.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Input Injection:** The core vulnerability is the improper handling of input data. This allows an attacker to inject malicious data into the iDRAC system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure:** By injecting specific crafted inputs, a malicious user could potentially gain access to sensitive information stored within the iDRAC system.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The vulnerability can be exploited to disrupt the normal operation of iDRAC, potentially rendering it unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Remote:** The vulnerability is remotely exploitable, meaning the attacker does not need physical access to the affected server.
- **Network:** The attacker would interact with the iDRAC via its network interface, likely through web-based management or other network protocols used by iDRAC.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user on the iDRAC system. However, only low privileges are required for successful exploitation. This suggests that the vulnerability is accessible to a wide range of users, rather than only administrator-level users.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to communicate with the iDRAC interface over the network.
- **Crafted Input:** The attacker needs the ability to craft specialized input data that will trigger the vulnerability, which is achievable by a threat actor with sufficient understanding of the affected interface.

**Summary of CVE-2021-36348:**

The vulnerability allows a remote, authenticated attacker with low privileges to inject crafted input into the Dell EMC iDRAC9 system, potentially leading to information disclosure or denial of service. This is due to improper input handling by the iDRAC software. The vulnerability is addressed in iDRAC9 version 5.00.20.00 and later.

The information provided in the Dell advisory provides more details than the standard CVE description, such as the specific nature of the vulnerability (input injection), the privilege level required for exploitation, and the specific impact of a successful attack.
