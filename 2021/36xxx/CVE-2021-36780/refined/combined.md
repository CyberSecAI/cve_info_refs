# Unauthorized data access from replicas through vulnerable instance manager pods

High

[innobead](/innobead)
published
GHSA-27q8-g55w-83p9
Dec 17, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.1.3, < 1.2.3

## Patched versions

1.1.3, 1.2.3

## Description

### Impact

The Longhorn instance manager pods are responsible for volume replica management and access. The vulnerability issue is found that it is possible to connect to a longhorn-engine replica instance running in the instance-manager replica pod. The longhorn-engine replica can handle multiple TCP connections. Each connection is able to read and write data on the replica. It may allow other pods in the cluster to read and write data to and from a replica that the malicious pod doesn't have access to.

### Patches

This issue is fixed in 1.1.3 and 1.2.3.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds/mitigations. Please upgrade the Longhorn cluster to 1.1.3 or 1.2.3 to resolve the issue.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn>

### Credits

Thanks to [Dagan Henderson](dhenderson%40goraft.tech) and [Will Kline](will.kline%40darkwolfsolutions.com) for reporting this vulnerability issue.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

# Host operations allowed in privileged Longhorn managed pods

High

Dec 17, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.1.3, < 1.2.3

## Patched versions

1.1.3, 1.2.3

## Description

### Impact

The privileged pods are managed by Longhorn running on every node for volume replica management in a Kubernetes cluster. Each pod container runs as root and exposes a gRPC service on TCP port 8500. The service is accessible by any workload in the cluster without authentication. A malicious workload can take advantage of this service to execute any binary present in the image on the host.

### Patches

This issue is fixed in 1.1.3 and 1.2.3.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds/mitigations. Please upgrade the Longhorn cluster to 1.1.3 or 1.2.3 to resolve the issue.

| **Is your feature request related to a problem? Please describe.** When longhorn-UI is deployed, it is easily accessible from inside the cluster without authentication. This poses a security risk if 1) not every application within the cluster is trusted 2) if there is a security breach within the kubernetes cluster in some way.  Additionally, hardening other components is probably worth-while.  **Describe the solution you'd like** Include a built-in NetworkPolicy in Longhorn.  **Describe alternatives you've considered** I don't know many other ways to secure a longhorn-ui deployment from internal components.  **Additional context** Not all Kubernetes distributions support NetworkPolicy, so I think a few good checks and balancers are worth-while   * The default deployment of longhorn should not break (fail to run, or fail to install completely). * If NetworkPolicy has no effect in any common Kubernetes distributions, it should be mentioned in the docs at very least. * Policies should not make use of any features outside of the standard kubernetes distribution (IE: from Calico) |

| I started writing calico specific network policies - not just for the UI, but for all components. To achieve this it would be extremely useful to have the necessary connections documented somehow - this issue looks like a good place to start. I currently have a working setup that allows / restricts the following.  Summarized based on a default deny all setup:  egress:   * allow egress traffic from all pods in `longhorn-system` to any destination (would be nice to be more precise)   ingress:   * allow pods that belong to my ingress controller on port `8000` to pods labeled with `app: longhorn-ui` * allow all pods in `longhorn-system` on port `9500` to pods labeled with `app: longhorn-manager` * allow all pods in `longhorn-system` on port `8500` to pods labeled with `longhorn.io/component: "instance-manager"` * allow all pods in labeled with `longhorn.io/component: instance-manager` or `app: longhorn-manager` to access ports in range `10000:12000` to pods labeled with `longhorn.io/component: instance-manager`   Especially the last rule looks fragile to me - I noticed that there were connection on port `10000` - afterwards on `10001` - on `10015`... therefore I decided to pick that range. |

| This is a huge problem. Any untrusted tenant or SSRF vulnerability means an attacker can delete volumes, or probably manipulate files on the nodes. This makes Longhorn a really bad idea for anything but a toy deployment 😨 |

| Test steps:   1. Deploy Longhorn 2. Deploy the network policies examples: <https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn-manager/tree/master/examples/network-policy> 3. Make sure all Longhorn functionalities are not broken by the network policies. 4. Try to ping/curl Longhorn pods from unauthorized pods specified in the network policy. Verify that the access is blocked. |

| Validating in progress, testing with master branch.  The example NetworkPolicies does its job by blocking access not defined in the rules. Creating and deleting volumes via kubectl after policies applied does not have problem. But I am still looking at the way to make UI work through the ingress and rancher proxy.   ---   Attaching some error messages for later discussion: With the ingress, it gives a `504 Gateway Time-out` With the example via Rancher UI, will sees 500 error,  ``` {   "kind": "Status",   "apiVersion": "v1",   "metadata": {        },   "status": "Failure",   "message": "error trying to reach service: dial tcp 10.42.3.4:8000: i/o timeout",   "code": 500 }  ``` |

| Validation - **PASSED**  Tested the examples configuration files with following combination, pods outside of the rule will not able to access longhorn-manager resources and the basic operations are working fine with the policies:   * Longhorn: master (20211109) * Kubernetes: RKE1, v1.20.12   + CNI: Canal   Things to be noticed:   * Longhorn UI via Rancher proxy won't go through, additional policies is needed to allow the traffic * For RKE2 will require different Network Policy configurations   -- Thanks [@PhanLe1010](https://github.com/PhanLe1010) for the discussion on my ingress set up. |
