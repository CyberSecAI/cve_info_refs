Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36780:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability arises from the fact that the Longhorn engine replica instance running within an instance-manager replica pod can handle multiple TCP connections. This allows unauthorized access to the replica's data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Access:** The primary vulnerability is the ability for any pod within the cluster to connect to the longhorn-engine replica instance. These connections are not properly controlled or authenticated.
*   **Lack of Authentication:** The longhorn-engine replica does not require authentication for TCP connections.
*   **Multiple TCP Connections:** The ability of the engine replica to handle multiple TCP connections increases the attack surface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Confidentiality Breach:** A malicious pod can read data from a replica it doesn't have authorized access to.
*   **Data Integrity Violation:** A malicious pod can write data to a replica, potentially corrupting or manipulating it.
*   **Potential for wider cluster compromise:** Malicious workloads could read or write data to replicas they are not authorized to interact with.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:**  Any pod within the Kubernetes cluster that has network access to the instance-manager replica pod can exploit this vulnerability. The attack vector is classified as "Adjacent".
*   **TCP Connection:** Exploitation involves establishing a TCP connection to the vulnerable longhorn-engine replica instance.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Pod within the Cluster:** The attacker needs to have a pod running within the same Kubernetes cluster as the vulnerable Longhorn deployment.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker's pod must be able to establish network connections to the instance manager pods.
*   **No Privileges Required:** No special privileges are required for a pod to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
*   The vulnerability is present in Longhorn versions prior to 1.1.3 and 1.2.3.
*   The vulnerability can allow pods to read and write data from a replica that the malicious pod does not have access to.
*   The vulnerability is rated as having a "High" severity and a CVSS score of 8.9.
*  The attack complexity is low.
*  User interaction is required.
* The scope of the vulnerability is changed (meaning the impact reaches beyond the vulnerable component).
*  Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability are all rated as "High" in terms of impact.
