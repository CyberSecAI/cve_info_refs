Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-36064:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability is a "Buffer Underflow", also referred to as "Buffer Underwrite". This occurs when a program attempts to write data before the beginning of an allocated memory buffer.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Buffer Underflow:** The primary vulnerability is the potential to write data outside the intended memory boundary before the start of the buffer.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Exploitation:** The attack vector is local, requiring the attacker to have some level of access to the system.
*   **User Interaction:** The user interaction is required, suggesting that the user needs to open or process a file with the specific exploit.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Local Access:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the application locally, typically by opening a malicious file.
*   **User Context:** The code execution would occur within the context of the user running the vulnerable application.
