Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The WordPress Responsive Tabs plugin, specifically versions 4.0.5 and earlier, is vulnerable to Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The provided information does not specify the exact location or method of injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): The plugin doesn't properly sanitize user input, allowing an attacker to inject malicious scripts.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Malicious actors can inject scripts into the website. This allows them to:
  - Redirect users to malicious websites.
  - Display unwanted advertisements.
  - Execute other HTML payloads when users visit the site.
  - Potentially perform other malicious actions, like stealing cookies or session tokens.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The exact attack vector is not detailed but generally with XSS, a malicious user would inject script through user-controlled input fields or other parts of the plugin that do not sanitize data. This data would then be rendered on the page for other users to execute.
- The attacker needs to be able to inject data into the vulnerable part of the plugin. The patchstack content mentions 'Author' privilege is required but does not detail where the input can be supplied.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  An attacker requires at least "Author" level privileges within the WordPress instance.
-  The attacker needs to identify the specific input field(s) or vulnerable code in the plugin where they can inject the malicious script.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability has a CVSS score of 4.8, considered low severity.
- Patchstack has issued a virtual patch to mitigate this issue for its users.
- The issue is fixed in version 4.0.6 of the plugin.
- The vulnerability is classified as an OWASP Top 10 A7: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
