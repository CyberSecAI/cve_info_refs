The tabs admittedly work pretty nicely if you are just figuring things out.
I’ve been trying to cancel this service for 3 years though and they keep charging me. Don’t give them your card details.

### [Nice & lightweight](https://wordpress.org/support/topic/nice-lightweight-2/)

[hj](https://profiles.wordpress.org/hj/ "Posts by hj")

Nice and lightweight plugin, pretty easy to follow and use right out of the box – created just what I wanted. Not many bells and whistles in the free version, a bit more dressing in the Pro version.
However, I’ve had a repeated problem of content not showing in the edit box when I want to edit a tab’s content. The content is definitely there, it shows in the tab mini-view area and on the live site – but hit the edit button and I’ve frequently, though not all the time, got an edit window with no visible content.
Could be a bug? Could be the browser? (Firefox 94 on Mac OSX).
I like it for its much smaller footprint than other plugins. But that content edit issue needs fixing.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
