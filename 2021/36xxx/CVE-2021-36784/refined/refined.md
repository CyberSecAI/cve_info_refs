Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36784:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a lack of restrictions on permissions when creating or editing Global Roles within Rancher. Users with the ability to create or update Global Roles were not limited to granting only permissions that they already possessed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Privilege Management:** The system failed to restrict the permissions that could be granted when creating or modifying Global Roles.
*   **Privilege Escalation:** Users with specific create/update permissions could grant themselves or other users higher-level administrative privileges.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** Attackers can escalate their privileges to admin-level, allowing them full control over Rancher.
*   **Full System Compromise:** The attacker could perform any action that an admin user can perform on the Rancher system, including creating clusters, managing users, and potentially impacting all managed resources.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network:** Exploitation occurs over the network, using the Rancher interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Create/Update Permissions:** Attackers must have existing permissions to create or update Global Roles in Rancher. This could be via roles like the `restricted-admin` role.
*   **Rancher Access:** The attacker needs to have network access to the Rancher instance.

**Technical Details and Descriptions:**

*   The vulnerability is present in Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.12 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.3.
*   Two specific methods for privilege escalation were identified:
    1.  Modifying the global `admin` role to be the default for new users and creating a new user to elevate them to the `admin` role.
    2.  Creating a new role with existing permissions of a user and then modifying that role to grant admin-level permissions to the user.
*   The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-269 ("Improper Privilege Management") and CWE-285 ("Improper Authorization").
*   CVSS v3 base score: 7.2, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Patched Versions**
The vulnerability is patched in versions 2.5.13, 2.6.4 and later releases.
