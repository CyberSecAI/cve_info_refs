# Privilege escalation for users with create/update permissions in Global Roles

High

[macedogm](/macedogm)
published
GHSA-jwvr-vv7p-gpwq
Apr 15, 2022

## Package

Rancher
(Rancher)

## Affected versions

From 2.5.0 and 2.6.0 up to and including 2.5.12 and 2.6.3

## Patched versions

2.5.13, 2.6.4 and later releases

## Description

### Impact

This vulnerability affects customers who utilize non-admin users that are able to create or edit [Global Roles](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/). The most common use case for this scenario is the [`restricted-admin`](https://rancher.com/docs/rancher/v2.6/en/admin-settings/rbac/global-permissions/#restricted-admin) role.

A flaw was discovered in Rancher versions from 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.12 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.3 which allows users who have create or update permissions on Global Roles to escalate their permissions, or those of another user, to admin-level permissions. Global Roles grant users Rancher-wide permissions, such as the ability to create clusters. In the identified versions of Rancher, when users are given permission to edit or create Global Roles, they are not restricted to only granting permissions which they already posses.

The privilege escalation can be taken advantage of in two ways by users with create or update permissions on Global Roles (including the `restricted-admin`):

1. Editing the global `admin` role to make it the default for new users, then creating a new user that will be elevated to the global `admin` role.
2. Creating a new global role with permissions already possessed by the `restricted-admin`, assigning this new role to a user, then modifying the global role to grant additional administrive like permissions (`'*'`) to the elevated user.

### Patches

Patched versions include releases 2.5.13, 2.6.4 and later versions.

### Workarounds

Limit access in Rancher to trusted users. There is not a direct mitigation besides upgrading to the patched Rancher versions.

**Note:** If you have users who have create or edit permissions on Global Roles but are not admin users (for example, the `restricted-admin`), it is highly advised to review the roles and users created by those users for possible privilege escalations.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Reach out to [SUSE Rancher Security team](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/policy) for security related inquiries.
* Open an issue in [Rancher](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/issues/new/choose) repository.
* Verify our [support matrix](https://www.suse.com/suse-rancher/support-matrix/all-supported-versions/) and [product support lifecycle](https://www.suse.com/lifecycle/).

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
