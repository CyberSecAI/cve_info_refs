- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Stack-based buffer overflow.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: A stack-based buffer overflow (CWE-121) exists in Adobe Photoshop.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is local (AV:L), requires low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N), user interaction (UI:R), and the scope is unchanged (S:U)
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have local access to the system and requires user interaction to trigger the vulnerability, such as opening a specially crafted file.
