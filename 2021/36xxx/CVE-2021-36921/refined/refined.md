Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36921:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authentication mechanism of the MonitorApp Application Insight Manager (AIMANAGER). Specifically, the application is vulnerable to response manipulation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
*   **Authentication Bypass:** An attacker can bypass the authentication process by tampering with the response of the authentication check request.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   Successful exploitation grants the attacker access to administrative functionalities with execute privileges. This allows the attacker to fully control the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The attack vector involves intercepting and modifying the authentication check request and its corresponding response. By manipulating the response, an attacker can trick the system into granting access without proper authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be positioned to intercept and manipulate network traffic between the user and the AIMANAGER server. This could involve man-in-the-middle attacks or other methods to intercept the communication.
*   The attacker needs to be able to understand the authentication process well enough to craft a manipulated response that bypasses the checks.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects AIMANAGER versions up to and including B107.
*   The vulnerability has been addressed in AIMANAGER B115 and later versions.
*   The exploit complexity is considered very low, making this an easy vulnerability to exploit.
