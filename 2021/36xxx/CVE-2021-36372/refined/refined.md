Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-36372:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Block tokens generated by Apache Ozone are persistently stored in the metadata database.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Token Persistence:** Block tokens are not ephemeral and remain stored even after their intended use period or after user permissions are revoked.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Authenticated users, even after having their access revoked, can retrieve these stored block tokens and potentially reuse them to access data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Access After Revocation:** Users with previously valid access can bypass access control mechanisms by using retrieved tokens.
- **Potential Data Breach:**  Revoked users could gain unauthorized access to data they should no longer have permission to view or modify.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to be a previously authenticated user who has had access to the key.
- **Metadata Database Access:** The attacker must be able to interact with the metadata database to retrieve the tokens.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have previously had legitimate access to the key.
- The attacker must be an authenticated user of the system.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the metadata database (likely through an API or other provided means) to retrieve the persisted tokens.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is tracked as HDDS-5315 in Apache's system.
- The mitigation involves upgrading to Apache Ozone version 1.2.0.
- The vulnerability was reported by Marton Elek.
