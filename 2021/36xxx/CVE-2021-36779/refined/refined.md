Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36779:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is the lack of authentication for the gRPC service exposed by the Longhorn instance manager pods. These privileged pods run as root on every node in a Kubernetes cluster for volume replica management. The gRPC service, running on TCP port 8500, is accessible to any workload within the cluster without any authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated gRPC Service:** The primary weakness is the gRPC service's lack of authentication, allowing any workload within the cluster to connect and send commands.
*   **Privileged Pods:** The Longhorn instance manager pods run with a privileged context, meaning they have extensive access to the host system.
*   **Root Access:**  The containers within these pods run as root, granting further powerful privileges.
*   **Host Operations:** The gRPC service allows for the execution of binaries present in the image which can be used to perform host operations.
*   **Data Access:** The longhorn-engine replica instance within the pod can handle multiple TCP connections, each able to read and write data on the replica, potentially allowing unauthorized access to volume data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A malicious workload can leverage the unauthenticated gRPC service to execute arbitrary binaries within the privileged pod. This includes access to utilities like `curl` and `apt`, enabling the installation and execution of arbitrary applications.
*   **Host Access and Modification:** Attackers can use the executed code to access and modify the host filesystem as root, potentially leading to full node compromise.
*   **Data Breaches/Manipulation:** A malicious pod can potentially read and write data to and from a replica that it should not have access to, resulting in data breaches or tampering with volume data.
*   **Cluster-Wide Impact:** Given that these pods run on every node, a single successful exploit can have widespread consequences across the entire Kubernetes cluster.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Access:** The attack vector is primarily network-based. An attacker needs to have a workload deployed within the same Kubernetes cluster as the vulnerable Longhorn instance.
*   **Lack of Network Segmentation:** The lack of network segmentation or authentication controls allows easy access to the vulnerable gRPC service from any other pod in the cluster.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Workload Deployment:** The attacker needs the ability to deploy a workload within the Kubernetes cluster where the vulnerable Longhorn setup is running. No other specific privileges on the cluster are required.
*   **Basic Network Knowledge:** Basic understanding of network communication within the Kubernetes cluster is required.
*   **gRPC knowledge (Optional):** While knowledge of gRPC is not strictly necessary since existing tools can be used, it would help in crafting more advanced exploits.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability is rated as "High" severity with a CVSS score of 8.9.
*   The attack vector is "Adjacent", meaning the attacker must be on the same network segment.
*   The attack complexity is "Low", meaning it is easy to exploit.
*   No privileges are required to initiate the attack.
*   User interaction is not required, beyond initial deployment.
*   The scope is "Changed" because the impact extends beyond the vulnerable component itself.

The provided information also notes that the vulnerability is fixed in Longhorn versions 1.1.3 and 1.2.3. There are no workarounds, so upgrading is necessary.
