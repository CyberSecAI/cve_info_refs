# Host operations allowed in privileged Longhorn managed pods

High

[innobead](/innobead)
published
GHSA-g358-m2wp-mhhx
Dec 17, 2021

## Package

No package listed

## Affected versions

< 1.1.3, < 1.2.3

## Patched versions

1.1.3, 1.2.3

## Description

### Impact

The privileged pods are managed by Longhorn running on every node for volume replica management in a Kubernetes cluster. Each pod container runs as root and exposes a gRPC service on TCP port 8500. The service is accessible by any workload in the cluster without authentication. A malicious workload can take advantage of this service to execute any binary present in the image on the host.

### Patches

This issue is fixed in 1.1.3 and 1.2.3.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds/mitigations. Please upgrade the Longhorn cluster to 1.1.3 or 1.2.3 to resolve the issue.

### References

N/A

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn>

### Impact

The Longhorn instance manager pods are responsible for volume replica management and access. The vulnerability issue is found that it is possible to connect to a longhorn-engine replica instance running in the instance-manager replica pod. The longhorn-engine replica can handle multiple TCP connections. Each connection is able to read and write data on the replica. It may allow other pods in the cluster to read and write data to and from a replica that the malicious pod doesn't have access to.

### Patches

This issue is fixed in 1.1.3 and 1.2.3.

### Workarounds

There are no workarounds/mitigations. Please upgrade the Longhorn cluster to 1.1.3 or 1.2.3 to resolve the issue.

### For more information

If you have any questions or comments about this advisory:

* Open an issue in <https://github.com/longhorn/longhorn>

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
