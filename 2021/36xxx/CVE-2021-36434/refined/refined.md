The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in jocms v0.8.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause of these vulnerabilities lies in the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied inputs before they are used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The following SQL injection vulnerabilities are described:
1. **Unsanitized JSON input in `mask.php` (lines 18-23):** The `id` parameter from JSON data is directly inserted into the `WHERE` clause of an SQL query in the `jo_get_masks()` function, without any sanitization.
2. **Unsanitized JSON input in `getmask.php` (lines 16-21):** Similar to the above vulnerability, the `content` parameter from JSON data is directly injected into a SQL query.
3. **Unsanitized POST parameters in `mask.php` (lines 19-30):** The `id`, `name`, and `code` parameters from POST data are used in `jo_set_mask()` function. The code parameter is processed with `str_replace` and `str_get_html`, but no sanitization is performed before being used in an SQL query.
4. **Unsanitized GET parameters in `mask.php` (lines 31-33):** The `id` parameter from GET data is directly used in the `jo_delete_mask()` function, without sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities allows an attacker to:
*   **Read or modify database contents:** An attacker can use SQL injection to bypass the intended logic of the application, retrieve sensitive data, modify existing data, or even create new data in the database. This is shown in the provided examples where the attacker retrieves the database version and inserts the "hacked" string.
*   **Execute arbitrary SQL queries:** The most significant impact is the ability to execute arbitrary SQL statements. Attackers can use this to potentially escalate privileges, achieve remote code execution (as demonstrated in the 3rd vulnerability), or cause a denial of service by manipulating the SQL queries.
*   **Time-based injection:** The fourth vulnerability allows time-based SQL injection, which can be used to extract data from the database in a more stealthy manner, though slower.
*   **Create malicious files:** By exploiting the 3rd vulnerability, an attacker can create a PHP file within the web root and execute arbitrary code, thus enabling the attacker to potentially take full control of the system.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vectors are:
*   **HTTP POST request with JSON body:** Sending a crafted JSON payload in the POST request to `mask.php` and `getmask.php`.
*   **HTTP POST request with form data:** Submitting a crafted POST request with form data to `mask.php`.
*   **HTTP GET request with URL parameters:** Sending a crafted URL with the `deleted` and `id` parameters to `mask.php`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No special privileges are required to perform the attack.
