Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36082:

**Summary:**

The provided content indicates that CVE-2021-36082 is a stack-based buffer overflow vulnerability in the `processClientServerHello` function of the nDPI library, specifically within the `src/lib/protocols/tls.c` file.

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient bounds checking when writing data to the `ja3_str` buffer within the `processClientServerHello` function. The code uses `snprintf` to format and write data related to TLS handshake parameters (version, ciphers, extensions, etc.) into `ja3_str`. However, the code was not correctly checking if the `snprintf` operations will exceed the buffer boundaries leading to potential overflow.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Stack-based buffer overflow:** The `ja3_str` buffer is allocated on the stack, making it vulnerable to overflow if the data written into it exceeds its allocated size.
*   **Lack of proper bounds checking with `snprintf`**:  The initial code uses `sizeof(ja3_str)` with snprintf which is only the size of the buffer, not the remaining size. The fixes use a variable to track the length of the string `ja3_str_len` and a define `JA3_STR_LEN` to avoid writing past the end of the buffer.
*   **Uncontrolled input:** The size of the data being written into `ja3_str` depends on the TLS handshake parameters, which are essentially controlled by the network traffic being processed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Code execution:** A successful stack-based buffer overflow can overwrite adjacent data on the stack, including return addresses, which can lead to arbitrary code execution if an attacker can control the overwritten data.
*   **Denial of service:** A buffer overflow can cause a crash, leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network Traffic:** The vulnerability is triggered during the processing of TLS handshake packets. Therefore, an attacker would need to send specially crafted TLS packets to trigger the overflow.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** An attacker would need to be positioned in a network path where they can intercept and manipulate TLS traffic targeting a system running a vulnerable version of nDPI.
*   **Crafted TLS Packets:** The attacker must be able to create TLS packets that will cause the `ja3_str` buffer to overflow in the vulnerable code.

**Additional Details:**

*   The fix for the vulnerability is implemented in the commit `1ec621c85b9411cc611652fd57a892cfef478af3` by modifying the loop conditions and `snprintf` calls in `src/lib/protocols/tls.c` to include a check on `JA3_STR_LEN` and track the string length to avoid exceeding the buffer size.
*   The `OSV-2021-304.yaml` file provides additional context, including:
    *   The vulnerability was identified by OSS-Fuzz.
    *   The vulnerability was introduced by commit `32bd3d7a599a6dfcfadf6ed4ad684f904e50719c`.
    *   The affected versions are <= 3.4
    *   The severity is considered HIGH.
