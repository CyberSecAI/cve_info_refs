How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

## Installation

1. Upload the âage-gateâ folder to the â/wp-content/plugins/â directory
2. Activate the plugin through the âPluginsâ menu in WordPress
3. Visit âAge Gateâ admin section and adjust your configuration.

**Important**

Be sure to check the âAccessâ settings tab to grant permissions and omit any post types you donât wish to display Age Gate options on.

## FAQ

### I canât get past the Age Gate / The Age Gate only worked once

The most likely cause for this is caching on your site either via a plugin or your hosting provider. If the Age Gate appears stuck try using the JavaScript mode in the advanced tab and clear any caches.

### Can I restrict a particular page?

You can. If you use selected content, a checkbox will appear in content pages

### Can I add my own logo/branding?

Of course, itâs your site

### Iâm in X country, can I format the date style?

Yes! DD MM YYYY and MM DD YYYY are supported along with a choice of how the dates are entered.

### I use caching, will that be affected?

From version 1.4.0 those using caching can select the âCache Bypassâ option to allow age gating even with caching on. Be sure to empty your cache when making changes to the plugin settings. From 2.0.0 this option is in Advanced -> Use uncachable version

The plugin has a red flag on the PageSpeed Report that says:
âPolyfills and transformations allow older browsers to use new JavaScript features. However, many are not necessary for modern browsers. For your integrated JavaScript, adopt a modern script implementation strategy by detecting module/nomodule functionality to reduce the amount of code sent to modern browsers while maintaining compatibility with legacy browsers.â
Edit:
The issue has been fixed. Iâll rate the plugin according to this edit.
