Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36877:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in the uListing WordPress plugin.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The plugin is vulnerable to CSRF attacks, which allow an attacker to force a logged-in user to perform unwanted actions on the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- A successful CSRF attack could allow a malicious actor to force higher-privileged users (e.g., administrators) to execute unintended actions. The specific impact depends on the vulnerable actions within the plugin, but it could potentially lead to unauthorized data modification, account takeover, or other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker could craft a malicious webpage that contains code that exploits the lack of CSRF protection in the plugin. This malicious code would initiate requests to the vulnerable web application, masquerading as an authorized user's actions.
- The attacker would need to trick a logged-in user into visiting the malicious webpage.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious webpage and trick a logged-in user into visiting it.
- The attacker doesn't require any special privileges on the target website.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is present in uListing plugin versions 2.0.5 and earlier.
- It was fixed in version 2.0.6.
- The vulnerability is considered to have low severity and is unlikely to be exploited, according to Patchstack.
- The provided text also mentions additional security issues fixed in version 2.0.6, such as: "CSRF requests in all plugin sections", "Unauthenticated Privilege Escalation for Registration", "Authenticated (Admin) Reflected XSS for User Plans" and "Authenticated (User) IDOR".
