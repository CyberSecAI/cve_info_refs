    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Displaying unwanted advertisements or content.
    *   Stealing sensitive information, such as session cookies.
    *   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   The vulnerability is triggered through an AJAX call within the plugin's CSS/JS manager.
*   The attacker needs to inject a malicious payload into the unsanitized parameters of the AJAX call.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be an administrator.
