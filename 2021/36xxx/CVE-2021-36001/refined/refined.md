- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The software reads data past the end of the intended buffer, resulting in an out-of-bounds read vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation leads to a memory leak.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability can be triggered locally.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to trick a user into opening a malicious file. User interaction (UI) is required. No privileges are needed, but it is a local attack vector.
