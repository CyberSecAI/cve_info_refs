- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input when creating download file links. Specifically, it allows the use of "javascript:" protocol in the download link, leading to XSS.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers. This could potentially lead to privilege escalation.
- **Attack vectors:** Creating a file download link with a "javascript:" protocol payload.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Any authenticated non-admin user.
