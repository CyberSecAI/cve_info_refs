Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36213:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a logic error in Consul's intention enforcement when using a specific configuration. When a default deny policy is active and a single Layer 7 (L7) application-aware intention with a deny action is defined, it incorrectly cancels out the intended blocking behavior, resulting in a fail-open scenario.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Incorrect Intention Enforcement:** The core issue lies in the flawed logic that processes L7 deny intentions in conjunction with a default deny policy. Instead of maintaining the deny state, the presence of the specific L7 intention results in traffic being allowed despite the intended block.
- **Fail-Open Vulnerability:** The flaw leads to a fail-open condition, where traffic that should be blocked is unexpectedly allowed, breaching the desired access control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass of Access Controls:** Exploitation allows unauthorized traffic to bypass intended restrictions, potentially leading to access to restricted services.
- **Data Exposure/Unauthorized Actions:** If the vulnerable service exposes sensitive data or performs unauthorized actions, the vulnerability could be leveraged for malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Configuration-Based Attack:** An attacker would need to configure Consul to use the specific vulnerable configuration. This would require them to have write access to Consul configurations, including setting a default deny policy and defining specific L7 intentions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Consul Configuration Access:** An attacker needs the ability to configure intentions within the Consul environment.
- **Understanding of Consul Intentions:** The attacker needs to be aware of how to craft intentions to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Network Access:**  The attacker needs to be in a position where they can attempt connections to the vulnerable service.

**Summary of the provided information:**

The provided content confirms that CVE-2021-36213 is a vulnerability in HashiCorp Consul related to how Layer 7 intentions are processed when combined with a default deny policy.  Specifically, the issue causes a single L7 deny intention to be ignored, resulting in a fail-open scenario where traffic that should be blocked is allowed. This vulnerability is fixed in Consul versions 1.9.8 and 1.10.1. The content also clarifies that this is a specific configuration that might not be common and that the L7 intention with a default deny is redundant configuration. The pull request and commit logs show the fix that was implemented.
