- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability exists within the Windows Installer Service. By creating a directory junction, an attacker can abuse the service to disclose the contents of arbitrary files.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The Windows Installer Service improperly handles directory junctions, leading to an information disclosure vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can disclose the contents of arbitrary files, potentially gaining access to sensitive information in the context of SYSTEM.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack is local and requires the ability to execute low-privileged code on the target system. The attacker creates a directory junction to exploit the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access and be able to execute low-privileged code on the target system.
