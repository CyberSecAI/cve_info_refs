Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-36224:

**Root Cause:** Hardcoded credentials for the `nobody` and `squeezecenter` users in Western Digital My Cloud Pro Series PR4100 devices.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
*   **Hardcoded Credentials:** The `nobody` user has a blank password and `squeezecenter` user has a password that can be easily cracked, both being the same across firmware versions. This allows unauthenticated access.
*   **Insecure Hashing:** The use of a weak MD5 hashing algorithm without salting makes the passwords trivial to crack.
*   **Unnecessary User Authentication in REST API:** The `/api/2.1/rest/firmware_update` endpoint allowed low-privileged users (specifically the 'nobody' user) to initiate a firmware update, when only admin users should have been permitted.
*   **Lack of Firmware Signature Verification:** The `upload_firmware` binary only performs basic integrity checks like checksums and magic number verification, but lacks cryptographic verification of the firmware, which allows the device to flash malicious firmware.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An unauthenticated attacker can achieve remote code execution as root on the PR4100 by exploiting the combination of these vulnerabilities.
*   **Persistent Backdoor:** The attacker can install a persistent backdoor, which gives them full control of the device even after a reboot, by replacing a binary executed at boot with their own malicious script.
*   **Full Device Control:** The attacker can gain complete control of the device and potentially access or modify sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the device, either through the local network or remotely if remote access is enabled.
*   **HTTP Requests:** The attacker sends HTTP POST requests to the `/api/2.1/rest/firmware_update` endpoint with the username `nobody` and an empty password to upload the malicious firmware.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable device.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoint and Authentication Method:**  The attacker needs knowledge of the specific API endpoint `/api/2.1/rest/firmware_update`, and that the `nobody` account has an empty password which can be used for authentication.
*   **Ability to craft malicious firmware**: The attacker needs to be able to generate a valid firmware image (which can be done by using the official GPL tools).

**Additional Details:**

* The advisory details how the vulnerabilities were discovered, the process for creating a backdoored firmware image using Western Digital's GPL code, and the steps for exploiting the device.
* It also discusses Western Digital's problematic release of MyCloud OS 5, the new operating system which fixed the mentioned vulnerabilities, and the issues it caused for users due to missing features and bricking devices, and their lack of communication.
* A temporary patch is provided as a shell script that restricts access to the firmware update endpoint. This script needs to be run at every boot to be effective.
* The researchers provided a YouTube video that demonstrates the full end-to-end exploit and further explain the vulnerabilities and the circumstances of their discovery during Pwn2Own competition.
