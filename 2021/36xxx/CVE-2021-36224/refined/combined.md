# Summary

This document describes a chain of vulnerabilities that were found by **Pedro Ribeiro ([@pedrib1337](https://twitter.com/pedrib1337) | pedrib@gmail.com)** and **Radek Domanski ([@RabbitPro](https://twitter.com/RabbitPro) | radek.domanski@gmail.com)** and *intended to be presented* at [Zero Day Initiative](https://www.zerodayinitiative.com/) **Pwn2Own Tokyo 2020** competition in November 2020.

The vulnerabilities described in this document are present in the network attached storage (NAS) device **Western Digital My Cloud Pro Series PR4100** ([PR4100](https://shop.westerndigital.com/products/network-attached-storage/wd-my-cloud-pro-series-pr4100)), on firmware versions up to and including 2.40.157.

The default configuration is exploitable by an unauthenticated attacker, who can achieve remote code execution as root on the PR4100. The exploit creates a persistent backdoor, which gives the attacker full control of the device even after a reboot.

The exploit chains three vulnerabilities to achieve code execution:

* [CVE-2021-36224](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36224): Hard-coded User Credentials
* [CVE-2021-36225](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36224): Firmware Upgrade Can be Initiated by Low Privilege User
* [CVE-2021-36226](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-36224): No Cryptographic Verification of Firmware Upgrades

All code snippets in this advisory were obtained from files in firmware version 2.40.155.

## Western Digital, the Party Poopers

Less than one week before the Pwn2Own competiton, WD released a entirely new operating system, OS version 5, which replaced OS version 3. This was certainly not a coincidence, as WD was listed as one of the ZDI "partners" for Pwn2Own.

The new operating system is completely different, and it killed off the vulnerabilities listed below, as well as many other vulnerabilities discovered by other competitors.
While fixing or killing vulnerabilities is a good thing, we believe that it was WD's intention to trip up all Pwn2Own competitors, and then claim "victory" by saying their product is secure and was not hacked at the competition.

While we did not have time to find new vulnerabilities in OS 5, other competitors did, and WD's evil plan was foiled - they were still humbled by a series of vulnerabilities disclosed at the competition.

However, it seems that OS 5 was released in such a rush that it didn't even implement some basic features expected by users of OS 3, and some device models running OS 3 were not supported at all.

We highly recommend that you watch [our video that explains all of these vulnerabilities](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsg9YgvGBec) in detail, as well as the drama surrounding it, which is also detailed in a [Krebs On Security article](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/).

# Vulnerability Details

## Background on PR4100 HTTP services

The PR4100 device exposes a number of services to the local network. There is an Apache *httpd* server running on ports 80 and 443, which hosts the main administrative web application and a REST API.

The REST API is the main component that we have abused to exploit the device.
It is accessible at */api/2.1/rest/\** and it exposes various API endpoints that are used for a variety of tasks, from managing data stored in the device, to accessing it, managing system properties of the device, etc. Each endpoint has different permissions such as the ones shown below:

* NO\_AUTH
* USER\_AUTH
* ADMIN\_AUTH\_LAN

The permissions are self explanatory, but the first one requires no authentication to access, the second one only authenticated users can access, while the last one is only accessible to administrative users. Each endpoint can be configured to respond to different HTTP verbs such as GET, POST, etc, and access is controlled by tagging it with one or more of the permissions shown above.

## Vulnerability 1: Hard-coded User Credentials

The first vulnerability we have identified in PR4100 was the usage of various hard-coded credentials for a number of users in the system. The contents of */etc/shadow* are shown below:

```
root:$1$$HTjCpuPOAkaXeDD7e2p.5.:14746:0:99999:7:::
sshd:$1$$HTjCpuPOAkaXeDD7e2p.5.:14746:0:99999:7:::
admin:$1$$CoERg7ynjYLsj2j4glJ34.:15882:0:99999:7:::
nobody:$1$$qRPK7m23GJusamGpoGLby/:15882:0:99999:7:::
squeezecenter:$1$$o7vIitnZu4MHlaR5S90M/1:15460:0:99999:7:::

```

The *root*, *sshd* and *admin* passwords are set when the device is configured for the first time, and therefore unique to each device. However, users *nobody* and *squeezecenter* have fixed passwords, which are the same across multiple firmware versions. These passwords are embedded in the firmware updates, therefore they are the same in every PR4100 device.

These passwords are trivial to crack using wordlists and rainbow tables due to the usage of a weak hashing algorithm (*md5crypt*) with no salting. After we ran these through a password cracker, the *nobody* password was found in seconds - it is actually an empty password ("").

We briefly attempted to crack the *squeezecenter* password but were unable to with a simple dictionary. We believe this password is easily crackable by bruteforcing with a GPU, AWS or other cloud password cracking mechanism. However this was unnecessary, since we could exploit the device with the *nobody* user, so it was not attempted.

## Vulnerability #2: Firmware Upgrade Can be Initiated by Low Privilege User

While the *nobody* user could not login via the web interface, it could perform *USER\_AUTH* (authenticated user) actions in the REST API. After auditing the REST API code for interesting calls, we found one that triggers a firmware update:

```

     */
    public function post($urlPath, $queryParams = null, $outputFormat = 'xml') {

        if (!isset($queryParams['filepath']) && isset($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'])) {
            $queryParams["filepath"] = "/CacheVolume/" . $_FILES['file']['name'];
            move_uploaded_file($_FILES['file']['tmp_name'], $queryParams['filepath']);
        }

        $fwUpdateObj = new Model\Firmware();
        $result = $fwUpdateObj->manualFWUpdate($queryParams);

        switch ($result) {
            case 'SUCCESS':
                $results = array('status' => 'success');
                $this->generateSuccessOutput(200, 'firmware_update', $results, $outputFormat);
                break;
            case 'BAD_REQUEST':
                throw new \Core\Rest\Exception('FIRMWARE_UPDATE_BAD_REQUEST', 400, NULL, self::COMPONENT_NAME);
            case 'SERVER_ERROR':
                throw new \Core\Rest\Exception('FIRMWARE_UPDATE_INTERNAL_SERVER_ERROR', 400, NULL, self::COMPONENT_NAME);
        }
    }
```
> Snippet 1: *Update.php::post()* firmware\_update POST REST API endpoint

We can see that it accepts a multipart file upload and then moves it to */CacheVolume*. At the time we thought this would allow us to write to an arbitrary directory using path traversal, but it seems that PHP sanitises the upload filename in the *$\_FILES* array, so this was not possible.

The filename is then passed to *manualFWUpdate()*, which is shown below:

```
    public function manualFWUpdate($changes) {

        if (!isset($changes['filepath'])) {
            return 'BAD_REQUEST';
        }

        $output=$retVal=null;
		$escFirmwareArg = escapeshellarg($changes["filepath"]);
        exec_runtime("sudo nohup /usr/local/sbin/updateFirmwareFromFile.sh $escFirmwareArg 1>/dev/null 2>&1 &", $output, $retVal, false);

        return 'SUCCESS';
    }
```
> Snippet 2: *Firmware.php::manualFWUpdate()*

In this snippet, the *filepath* shell argument is escaped, which avoids command injection, but then it is passed to */usr/local/sbin/updateFirmwareFromFile.sh*, which is shown below:

```
#!/bin/sh
#
# Modified by Alpha_Hwalock, for LT4A
#
# updateFirmwareFromFile.sh <filename> [check_filesize]"
#
# <return>	 1:	shell script check failure
#			 0: success
#			-1: upload_firmware return fail

PATH=/sbin:/bin:/usr/bin:/usr/sbin:/usr/local/bin:/usr/local/sbin

. /etc/nas/alert-param.sh

filename=${1}
check_size=${2:-""}
upFwPathPrefix="/usr/local/upload/"

# check params
if [ $# -lt 1 ]; then
    echo "usage: updateFirmwareFromFile.sh <filename> [check_filesize]"
    exit 1
fi
if [ ! -f ${filename} ]; then
    echo "File not found"
    exit 1
fi

# hwalock: check file size
if [ "${check_size}" != "" ]; then
    FileSize=`cat /tmp/fw_upgrade_filesize`
    blocksize_ls=`ls -l ${filename} | awk '{print $5}'`
    if [ "${FileSize}" != "${blocksize_ls}" ]; then
        echo "failed 202 \"failed download file size check\"" | tee /tmp/fw_update_status
		exit 1
    fi
fi

upload_firmware -c auto
cp -f ${filename} /usr/local/upload/newFirmware

touch /tmp/upload_fw
upload_firmware -n newFirmware
status=$?

do_reboot &
#alert_test -a ${rebootRequired} -f&

exit ${status}
```
> Snippet 3: */usr/local/sbin/updateFirmwareFromFile.sh*

Here we can see that the firmware file we have uploaded is copied to */usr/local/upload/newFirmware* and then *upload\_firmware* is invoked.

*upload\_firmware* is an executable file that performs integrity checks on the firmware file, and then if all checks are passed, flashes the file to the eMMC memory chip.

In order to access this API with the *nobody* user, we simple have to send the following POST request:

```
POST /api/2.1/rest/firmware_update?auth_username=nobody&auth_password=

< ... multipart file upload ...>

```

Recall that *nobody* has an empty password, hence why it will allow access to this authenticated endpoint.

We believe this is a critical flaw - why is a unprivileged user allowed to upload firmware files and initiate firmware upgrades? This functionality should only be performed by administrative users.

## Vulnerability #3: No Cryptographic Verification of Firmware Upgrades

In order to have secure firmware upgrades, a firmware upgrade file should be signed by device vendor in order for the device to verify its authenticity.
Unfortunately for Western Digital, that is not the case for the PR4100 device.

The final part of the upgrade process is when *upload\_firmware* is invoked. This binary does simple integrity checks such as checksums, verifying magic numbers, etc, but no cryptographic verification of the uploaded firmware.

This means that any firmware upgrade file that is received and passes the integrity checks will be flashed onto the device.

# Exploitation

As shown in the previous sections, we can access the authenticated REST API endpoints with the default user *nobody* and use the *firmware\_update* API endpoint to upload a firmware file to the device. As long as this file passes the integrity checks, it will be flashed onto the device.

To create a valid firmware file we can use the PR4100 GPL code. This code contains tools to build firmware images that are accepted by the device, and saved us a lot of time of reverse engineering on how to build a valid firmware file.

There are multiple ways to achieve code execution since we fully control the firmware file that is flashed onto the device. We chose to replace the UPNP daemon *upnp\_nas\_device*, which is called at every boot, with a shell script that spawns an unauthenticated telnet root shell on port 4444.

The firmware file is then uploaded to the device and after a few minutes of upgrading and rebooting, we can connect to port 4444 on the device and get our root shell:

```
BusyBox v1.20.2 (2019-07-04 10:39:50 CST) built-in shell (ash)
Enter 'help' for a list of built-in commands.

root@MyCloudPR4100 / # id
uid=0(root) gid=0(root)
root@MyCloudPR4100 / # uname -a
Linux MyCloudPR4100 4.1.13 #1 SMP Mon Jun 29 00:11:44 PDT 2020 Build-git249a60f x86_64 GNU/Linux
root@MyCloudPR4100 / #

```

By flashing the stock firmware we can revert our changes and "unbackdoor" the device.

## Full exploit

The full end-to-end exploit is shown below. This exploit builds the backdoored firmware image, uploads it to the device and then connects to the root reverse shell. The exploit takes a minimum of 5 minutes to run, depending on the network and CPU speed of the computer running the exploit. It is recommended to run the exploit in a Kali, Debian or Ubuntu machine that can run 32 bit binaries.

In the Pwn2Own competition, our intention was to use a shortened version that uploaded a pre-built backdoored firmware image instead. This shortened version consists of steps 6 and 7 of the exploit below, and takes a maximum of 3 minutes and 30 seconds to run in order to fit the competition's time limits (5 minutes per attempt).

[00:06] However, the competition was very dramatic,
as manufacturers released last minute firmware
[00:12] updates which killed a lot of vulnerabilities.
Today, we will show you a chain of these
[00:17] vulnerabilities, which allow an
unauthenticated attacker to execute
[00:21] code as root in a Western Digital NAS
device and install a permanent backdoor.
[00:26] We will also show you why we think Western Digital
screwed up and this might still be a zero day.

[00:41] Hey, this is Pedro.
Before we go into the
[00:43] vulnerability details, let's quickly explain
our position and why we're doing this.
[00:48] Here's the story. One week before Pwn2Own Tokyo
2020, Western Digital released a new update for
[00:54] their network attached storage (NAS) devices.
This new update is called
[00:59] OS5 whereas the older one is OS3.
It is a complete rewrite of the operating system
[01:06] and Radek will show you the
differences between the two shortly.
[01:09] This new operating system obviously killed a
lot of vulnerabilities that other teams and us
[01:14] were going to use in Pwn2Own.
In fact, it did wipe out some
[01:17] teams from the competition.
This is all within Pwn2Own rules.
[01:20] What ZDI does is, one day before the competition
they update all devices to the latest firmware.
[01:26] So you know what, let's give them
a taste of their own medicine.
[01:30] Let's give them one week to fix these
vulnerabilities, the same week they gave
[01:34] us to find new vulnerabilities in OS5.
So as we are shooting this video we gave
[01:39] vulnerability details to Western Digital.
We don't know what's going to happen,
[01:43] if they're going to patch it or not. We'll do
at the end of this video a one week video update
[01:49] to tell you what happened.
And finally let's justify
[01:52] ourselves: why are we doing this?
There are several reasons: first of all
[01:56] OS3 is out of support.
There is a November 2020
[02:01] advisory by other researchers that found
remote code execution vulnerabilities in OS3.
[02:07] Western Digital's official response was: if
you have a supported model upgrade to OS5;
[02:13] otherwise disable remote access.
That's it, they basically don't
[02:17] care about OS3 anymore.
Having said that they just
[02:20] released a new OS3 version in December 2020.
So what gives WD, do you support it or not?
[02:26] I guess we'll find out in one week right?
Secondly, we did a lot of research on
[02:30] Shodan and BinaryEdge and only found a
couple of thousand vulnerable devices,
[02:34] so we don't consider this high risk.
And finally, we're also providing a patch
[02:38] at the end of this video, so stay tuned.
So what do you think do you think?
[02:42] Are we a-holes or do you agree with
us? Let us know in the comments.
[02:46] OK with that out of the way let's go to
Radek, which will show us our target.
[02:51] Western Digital My Cloud Pro Series
PR4100. Wow what a long name!
[02:57] Let me introduce you our target: it's a
four bay home NAS solution, quite expensive.
[03:02] It has two Ethernet and
power ports for redundancy,
[03:05] so we think that it was designed for power users.
You could use it for backups, pictures, movies,
[03:11] whatever you can think of and yeah,
happy professional people also use it.
[03:18] Let's dive in into the management interface.
It welcomes us with a status page.
[03:23] System is healthy and runs
latest OS3 firmware version.
[03:28] From a functionality point of view
you can add users, share folders,
[03:32] install apps, configure the Internet cloud,
do various backups, use RAID for disks, etc.
[03:41] In the settings we can find
the firmware update tab.
[03:45] I disabled automatic updates, but I can still
update the firmware manually if i want to.
[03:52] For research purposes we are happy it
supports SSH. Makes life much easier.
[04:01] The target is running OS3. As mentioned before,
OS5 is a completely different operating system.
[04:08] In OS5 most of the components were
removed or rewritten to Golang.
[04:14] So the component that we're gonna show you
how we attacked doesn't exist anymore in OS5.
[04:20] At the release of OS5 in late October,
[04:22] only few devices from the Western
Digital line-up supported it.
[04:26] That effectively means that Western Digital
was running two parallel operating systems!
[04:31] What is more, a lot of functionality
of OS3 was not yet ported to OS5.
[04:37] When we tried to upgrade to OS5
it actually bricked our device.
[04:41] So we couldn't get rid of the feeling that
Western Digital decided to release a still
[04:46] work-in-progress OS5, which angered not
only us but also a lot of regular users.
[04:51] Take a look at the feedback shortly
after the release. It broke a lot
[04:55] of the users' functionality and also
they were unable to roll back to OS3,
[04:59] as Western Digital blocked such functionality.
[05:02] Actually, we found a way to roll back from
OS5 to OS3, which we will show you later in
[05:06] the video. So if you hate OS5 as much as we
do, continue watching the video to learn how
[05:12] to roll back and don't forget to apply the
patch for the vuln that we are presenting.
[05:18] OK, let's move on and SSH into the NAS. We
have to use the pre-defined username sshd.
[05:24] OK, it has root privileges.
[05:33] A lot of processes running,
all of them as root, awesome!
[05:40] Let's check if there are other
users configured on the box.
[05:45] OK, root, sshd, admin, all of them use the
same password that I have set, but nobody and
[05:51] squeezecenter... Interesting, what are those?
Can we crack the passwords?
[05:57] Let's set john with the password and shadow files.
[06:00] We have to first use the unshadow
command to prepare it for john.
[06:08] OK we're good to go, first
we'll try the dictionary attack.
[06:19] Oh crap! The nobody user uses a blank password!
[06:24] Some time later and we have
both accounts cracked, sweeeeet.
[06:30] So can we just like that
log in with the user nobody?
[06:34] What? Oh no, doesn't let
us in, what about the SSH?
[06:43] Same story what a useless account.
[06:46] OK let's get back to our recon and see
what processes are listed on the box.
[06:51] Quite some attack surface. Let's start from
the top and look into that web interface... but
[06:56] i'm tired, Pedro please take over and turn that
useless nobody account into something positive.
[07:02] OK, awesome, thanks Radek. This is Pedro,
[07:05] I'm going to take over and show you
a bit of what we have on the device.
[07:09] If we start digging around the /var/www
folder, we find this rest-api folder.
[07:16] Looking a bit further, we will see that
it has a lot of interesting directories
[07:21] and then if we dig still further,
we'll find lots of PHP files.
[07:27] And it appears this is not the same as
the web interface that Radek showed us.
[07:32] So what can we do with it right? If we
couldn't use the nobody account for the other,
[07:37] perhaps we could use it for this one?
Let's dig in a bit into it and investigate.
[07:45] Let's have a look at one of these
files called StorageUsage.php.
[07:49] We have a short description
and then we have a PHP class.
[07:53] It returns XML by default. Then again we have
some comments on the code and then the function.
[08:00] It uses a lot of PHP objects,
let's ignore it for now.
[08:03] Here in the description we can see this is to
check the storage being used by photos, etc.
[08:09] Importantly, no authentication is
required and also helpfully, we have here
[08:14] the URL we can use to access this API.
It includes some optional parameters,
[08:19] we don't really care about that, and then
also shows us possible response codes.
[08:25] OK, this all looks good, let's
have a look at it in the device.
[08:30] If we use curl and hit that URL, then we can see
what happens and yeah, seems to return the usage,
[08:38] you know, bytes being used. OK,
this looks good, looks promising.
[08:45] Now we know how the API works for
unauthenticated stuff, so now let's
[08:50] try and do something more interesting, call
an authenticated API using our nobody account.
[08:57] Here we have this API used to retrieve device
info. It is authenticated and here is the URL.
[09:05] We got some response codes and we got an
expected response in XML, and here's the code.
[09:10] We don't need to focus on it, the
description tells us what it does.
[09:16] Now we do a curl request to it and as
expected, we're not authorized to do it.
[09:21] Now let's try and inject our nobody user.
[09:24] It has no password so let's pass just the
user and hopefully we'll be able to hit it.
[09:32] Not yet? What's wrong?
It has an empty password! Maybe
[09:37] we should pass that as empty? Yeah, I guess so, it
doesn't make much sense but we're hackers right?
[09:43] We got to try all possibilities.
Let's do it... Yeah there we go!
[09:50] We're authenticated!
This looks awesome!
[09:53] Now we can access authenticated
APIs with that nobody account.
[09:57] Let's just check with some bogus
password, and yeah it wasn't a fluke!
[10:01] We can really do it! So now let's
look at something more interesting.
[10:07] Now let's look at the file where we found a
vulnerability this file is called Update.php
[10:11] and it's in the Firmware folder.
As the others, it extends the REST
[10:16] component and the default data format is XML
OK, so this file has several methods on it.
[10:25] The first one is the GET request.
Here's the URL and what it does,
[10:29] return status of the firmware update in progress.
Doesn't require any auth. Yeah this is not
[10:35] interesting for us right from a vulnerability
point of view, so let's just skip it.
[10:40] Then we got the PUT request
which is a bit more interesting.
[10:44] Causes the NAS to fetch and update firmware to
the same URL as PUT and then take some parameters.
[10:52] So looks like it downloads something and installs
it as firmware? This definitely looks interesting,
[11:00] but you know, let's keep going and
see what the rest of the file has.
[11:04] Here's the PUT, let's go on, here's our
POST request so this is more interesting
[11:09] because it's enough to update the firmware
in the file that is copied to the device.
[11:13] Hmm, OK so it has some parameters like
filepath, but looks like if we don't
[11:19] specify that parameter the file is assumed
to be streamed as part of the HTTP POST?
[11:24] So does this mean if we do a POST to this URL,
it will take whatever we have in a POST body and
[11:31] accept it as a firmware file?
Possible right?
[11:34] OK let's look at this POST method
and understand what's going on.
[11:38] So it takes the $\_FILES array.
This $\_FILES array is something that is built
[11:43] in PHP. When you upload a file, it gets filled
with the file name and the file data, all of this.
[11:50] It does something with it and then
passes to this manualFWUpdate() function.
[11:55] OK, let's see what goes on here. If filepath
not set and if file tmp\_name exists,
[12:02] it builds some sort of file path that
appends /CacheVolume to the name you provide
[12:09] and then moves this uploaded file to /CacheVolume.
Looking at it as a hacker we can see maybe there
[12:17] is some potential for directory traversal,
so we can write files arbitrarily.
[12:21] Unfortunately PHP is quite smart and sanitizes the
file name, so there's nothing we can do with it.
[12:27] Anyway, in essence what's happening
here is that our file name is being
[12:33] concatenated with /CacheVolume, written to
there and then passed to manualFWUpdate().
[12:38] Now let's look at the device see what happens.
[12:40] Here we got a curl POST request
to that firmware update.
[12:44] Hmm user not authorized. OK, remember we got our
little trick right? So we pass user as nobody and
[12:54] then we give it an empty password, and
then let's see what happens and BINGO!
[13:01] Something happened! This looks really
promising I think we need to dig further.
[13:09] OK, so let's have a look at
it again. Here's the POST,
[13:12] we already explained what
passes on with those parameters
[13:15] and manualFWUpdate() gets invoked with our
query parameters, which is basically the file.
[13:21] Let's have a look at that in another tab,
here it is, it just takes the file path
[13:26] from us and then does escapeshellarg().
If you're not familiar with it, it is a
[13:31] PHP function that escapes arguments
to be used in shell scripts and
[13:36] in system calls, this kind of thing.
So that's quite unfortunate, because here
[13:40] would be quite a nice command injection if they
didn't use it, but looks like they were smart.
[13:45] Anyway, our arguments get passed to
updateFirmwareFromFile.sh which is a shell script.
[13:53] That's basically our file being passed
there, that's fine, let's have a look at it.
[14:00] Here's the updateFirmwareFromFile.sh we can
see it takes the file name as a parameter
[14:05] which gets passed from the POST request,
an optional check\_filesize parameter,
[14:10] we don't care about that.
So there's some parameter checking
[14:14] then the check\_filesize, we don't care, OK
we move on, we have some upload\_firmware
[14:20] binary we don't know about being invoked, our
file gets copied to /usr/local/upload/newFirmware
[14:26] and then another binary we don't
know upload\_firmware gets invoked
[14:30] with this newFirmware file, reboots,
done. OK, let's dig in a bit more.
[14:38] Let's recap all of this. Here we have
our bald but very good looking hackers
[14:44] and on the right side our vulnerable REST API.
So our hackers send an HTTP POST with a
[14:50] malicious firmware, this gets processed in
the post() method, manualFWUpdate() method,
[14:57] updateFirmwareFromFile.sh shell file, goes
into some unknown binary and then we pwn it?
[15:04] I guess so. But wait it's not that simple,
it expects a certain firmware format.
[15:12] But here's the thing, luckily for us there's
no cryptographic checks on this firmware,
[15:19] so if we can guess the
format we can really own it.
[15:23] OK so let's recap and look
at all the vulns we have.
[15:28] First we authenticate using the
nobody user and an empty password.
[15:33] Then we send our malicious firmware, we
have to pack this firmware in a certain
[15:37] format but is not cryptographically checked,
and yes, we do consider this a vulnerability.
[15:43] If you disagree, let us know in the comments.
But here are our three vulns.
[15:48] I know I keep saying that the firmware has to be
in a certain format but we haven't showed you how.
[15:53] Here's the thing: if you go to Western Digital's
support page for this device and you scroll down,
[15:59] you will see they have GPL
for download, a GPL package.
[16:03] It's quite a large package,
covers a lot of versions
[16:06] and this is what we use in our exploit.
So in reality we didn't really find out
[16:11] how the firmware needs to be packaged, we use
this GPL to do everything for us in the exploit.
[16:17] Very easy. And with this, off the Radek
again to show us the exploit in action.
[16:25] So that useless nobody account is
not really that useless anymore?
[16:29] Cool, it's time to pwn the box.
Let's look into the exploit,
[16:33] it's just a batch script really.
On top we have a nice banner that
[16:37] says that we were supposed to
use it at Pwn2Own Tokyo 2020.
[16:41] The script takes only one argument,
the IP address of the target.
[16:46] Next we have a variable that holds information
for which firmware you want to build the image.
[16:52] At this stage we just download the package
from the Western Digital website and untar it.
[16:59] Now we have to prepare the firmware, we replace
the firmware version to anything that you want.
[17:05] This is the version that the
target will think it will run,
[17:08] we are leet right, so let's put
the version number accordingly.
[17:13] So with the vulnerability that we
have we can only upload the firmware
[17:16] but we still need code execution.
There are many ways to do it obviously,
[17:21] we simply found a binary that starts at the
system boot and replace it with a malicious file.
[17:26] It will simply start telnetd on port 4444.
[17:32] OK, we are done with file modifications,
so we can build a file system image.
[17:36] There is a create\_image.sh
shell script that we can use
[17:41] for that and that comes with the GPL package.
We make sure that we have it in the merge folder
[17:47] that stores all the components that will
be used to create a final firmware image.
[17:52] We go to that directory and we can build the
final firmware together with kernel, bootloader
[17:59] and other components that come
by default with the GPL package.
[18:04] So now we can use curl to exploit the
vuln and send our firmware to the target.
[18:09] We'll abuse the firmware update API call
with the username nobody and empty password.
[18:18] Now sit back and relax. The script is
constantly making connections to port 4444.
[18:24] When the box is flashed, it opens
the telnetd port and we are in.
[18:31] Let's start the exploit.
[18:37] First the GPL firmware package is downloading.
[18:49] Now we build our flashback
image with the backdoor.
[18:53] OK, Larry so what we gonna do? Everything is
ready to send it, we let this baby leave or what?
[18:58] I don't know I just woke up from a
little nap, it's a little dark but
[19:01] you guys silly? I'm still gonna send it.
[19:10] Haha I can't argue with Larry, let's do it.
[19:14] We're uploading the firmware and
the firmware is being installed.
[19:22] Now it will take a while.
[19:29] And we're root! We win!
[19:35] So obviously this exploit would work over the
Internet if you enabled remote management access.
[19:41] So don't be a noob and disable it immediately.
As we want to make the Internet a safer place
[19:48] and save you from nude pictures leaks,
we have a nice surprise for you, a patch!
[19:56] Thanks for that Radek.
So now we know that we have a vulnerability,
[20:01] we know how to exploit it but here's the thing,
[20:04] if Western Digital is not going
to fix it, how do we fix it?
[20:08] One thing we didn't touch in this
video is how authentication is done.
[20:12] We're not going to go into detail as
this would make the video too boring,
[20:15] but at top level of each API folder there's this
XML file like the one we're seeing on the screen.
[20:21] For each controller and URL it contains
the security of each HTTP method.
[20:28] So we can see a GET, PUT, can see
POST and then they are tagged with a
[20:33] certain string that identifies the
kind of authentication required.
[20:37] For example NO\_AUTH\_LAN, USER\_AUTH, ADMIN\_AUTH,
I think those are pretty self-explanatory right?
[20:46] So let's go to our firmware and
here we see our firmware\_update.
[20:50] We see the GET method has no user auth, the
POST requires USER\_AUTH and the PUT ADMIN\_AUTH.
[20:57] Why is POST and PUT different?
Don't know, ask WD,
[21:01] they're the ones who screwed up.
But to fix it we just replace
[21:04] USER\_AUTH in the POST with ADMIN\_AUTH.
We save the file and now our API is
[21:10] authenticated. Only an admin can access it
and nobody should not be used to access it.
[21:16] So let's try it out with
curl and see what happens.
[21:19] We send a request... uff, well looks like we
can still hit the API with the nobody user.
[21:27] What went wrong here?
You know the problem might
[21:31] be that while we updated the XML, the
server didn't pick it up automatically.
[21:37] Let's find out where the HTTP server is running,
we just copy its arguments so we can run it again
[21:45] and now we're going to kill it and then restart
it and hopefully it will pick up our API changes.
[21:53] We do that and now we use curl to try and hit
it again with nobody user... and there we go!
[22:02] Our vuln is now fixed! We're not
vulnerable anymore. However, there's a
[22:07] catch... This patch will not survive a reboot.
This is because the NAS uses the squashfs file
[22:13] system, which is embedded in the firmware,
and while we could use our exploit to install
[22:19] a patched firmware, an exploit like this can
be quite dangerous and brick some devices.
[22:24] So instead, we're providing in the video
description a link to a GitHub which includes
[22:29] an automated shell script that you need to run at
every boot and it will patch this vulnerability.
[22:35] But remember, do not expose
your NAS to the internet.
[22:38] This is the most important.
[22:41] As we mentioned before, we believe early
release of OS5 was not production ready.
[22:46] It actually bricked our target and
we had to find a way to unbreak it.
[22:50] And here comes a bonus point: Western Digital
claims you cannot roll back from OS5 to OS3.
[22:57] Guess what, a while back I posted
on Twitter how to downgrade.
[23:01] Now let's see that in action.
You have to open the case,
[23:06] it's really just a mini computer in there.
Immediately you can spot the interface which
[23:11] could be a UART and it is. So we need a
UART USB device to connect to the pins.
[23:18] If you haven't watched our video about
UART, I strongly suggest you watch it
[23:21] as we go in details what UART is, how
to identify pins and how to use it.
[23:27] Let's connect to the console.
[23:30] You can enter the BIOS if you
wanted to, but here we have a
[23:34] GRUB and look, we can pick a rescue mode.
Sounds legit, I'm sure it must be useful.
[23:40] You can even log into the console
as root but you don't have to,
[23:44] and you know why, because rescue mode exposes
a nice web interface which can be used to flash
[23:50] any firmware. No restrictions whatsoever.
Let's wait for it to finish flashing.
[24:02] And that's it we are back in OS3, we win!
[24:11] OK guys it's been one week since
we sent the original email.
[24:15] We did a follow-up shortly, we used my
email address, we use Radek's email address
[24:21] to make sure it didn't land in their spam folder.
[24:23] We didn't get an answer, in their
security page they say they answer
[24:27] in three business days so maybe they are
busy or they don't care, we don't know.
[24:32] Anyway this leaves you two options: either
you apply our patch or you upgrade to OS5.
[24:39] You can find the link to the
patch in the description.
[24:42] Make sure to subscribe to our channel,
watch our other videos and take care!

# Another 0-Day Looms for Many Western Digital Users

July 2, 2021

[24 Comments](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/#comments)

![](https://krebsonsecurity.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/07/mycloud.png)

Countless **Western Digital** customers saw their **MyBook Live** network storage drives remotely wiped in the past month thanks to a bug in a product line the company stopped supporting in 2015, as well as a previously unknown zero-day flaw. But there is a similarly serious zero-day flaw present in a much broader range of newer Western Digital **MyCloud** network storage devices that will remain unfixed for many customers who can’t or won’t upgrade to the latest operating system.

At issue is a remote code execution flaw residing in all Western Digital network attached storage (NAS) devices running **MyCloud** **OS 3**, an operating system the company only recently stopped supporting.

Researchers [**Radek Domanski** and **Pedro Ribeiro**](https://www.flashback.sh/) originally planned to present their findings at the [Pwn2Own hacking competition in Tokyo](https://www.thezdi.com/blog/2020/7/28/announcing-pwn2own-tokyo-2020-live-from-toronto) last year. But just days before the event Western Digital released **MyCloud OS 5**, which eliminated the bug they found. That update effectively nullified their chances at competing in Pwn2Own, which requires exploits to work against the latest firmware or software supported by the targeted device.

Nevertheless, in February 2021, the duo published [this detailed YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsg9YgvGBec), which documents how they discovered a chain of weaknesses that allows an attacker to remotely update a vulnerable device’s firmware with a malicious backdoor — using a low-privileged user account that has a blank password.

The researchers said Western Digital never responded to their reports. In a statement provided to KrebsOnSecurity, Western Digital said it received their report after Pwn2Own Tokyo 2020, but that at the time the vulnerability they reported had already been fixed by the release of My Cloud OS 5.

“The communication that came our way confirmed the research team involved planned to release details of the vulnerability and asked us to contact them with any questions,” Western Digital said. “We didn’t have any questions so we didn’t respond. Since then, we have updated our process and respond to every report in order to avoid any miscommunication like this again. We take reports from the security research community very seriously and conduct investigations as soon as we receive them.”

Western Digital ignored questions about whether the flaw found by Domanski and Ribeiro was ever addressed in OS 3. A statement published on its support site March 12, 2021 says the company will [no longer provide further security updates to the MyCloud OS 3 firmware](https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-21004-recommended-upgrade-to-mycloud-os-5).

“We strongly encourage moving to the My Cloud OS5 firmware,” the statement reads. “If your device is not eligible for upgrade to My Cloud OS 5, we recommend that you upgrade to one of our other My Cloud offerings that support My Cloud OS 5. More information can be found [here](https://shop.westerndigital.com/support/software/my-cloud-os).” A list of MyCloud devices that can support OS 5 is [here](http://My Cloud EX2 Ultra My Cloud EX4100 My Cloud PR2100 My Cloud PR4100 My Cloud DL2100 My Cloud DL4100 My Cloud EX2100 My Cloud (Firmware 2.xx.xxx) My Cloud Mirror Gen 2).

But according to Domanski, OS 5 is a complete rewrite of Western Digital’s core operating system, and as a result some of the more popular features and functionality built into OS3 are missing.

“It broke a lot of functionality,” Domanski said of OS 5. “So some users might not decide to migrate to OS 5.”

In recognition of this, the researchers have [developed and released their own patch](https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=video_description&redir_token=QUFFLUhqa3VQYnhhbG9LMDRFdlRuX1Y3aVFnTXVEU2swQXxBQ3Jtc0ttRVl0SExFQ29oRFkyNzlvRXpWdXJ5ekxTOGdoS2tpck1nQ0tpYnNyMGs3WVdxQkNtRTl0ZnJaUW9RNlFMX08xT0JOdFJHMXhYUjdyelZNX2pPbzBhaEpSdWVITUotWVkzd2ZPNUFubFJWd09tbGNLOA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fgithub.com%2Fpedrib%2FPoC%2Fblob%2Fmaster%2Fadvisories%2FPwn2Own%2FTokyo_2020%2Fweekend_destroyer%2Fweekend_destroyer_patch.sh) that fixes the vulnerabilities they found in OS 3 (the patch needs to be reapplied each time the device is rebooted). Western Digital said it is aware of third parties offering security patches for My Cloud OS 3.

“We have not evaluated any such patches and we are unable to provide any support for such patches,” the company stated.

Domanski said MyCloud users on OS 3 can virtually eliminate the threat from this attack by simply ensuring that the devices are not set up to be reachable remotely over the Internet. MyCloud devices make it super easy for customers to access their data remotely, but doing so also exposes them to attacks like last month’s that led to the mass-wipe of MyBook Live devices.

“Luckily for many users they don’t expose the interface to the Internet,” he said. “But looking at the number of posts on Western Digital’s support page related to OS3, I can assume the userbase is still considerable. It almost feels like Western Digital without any notice jumped to OS5, leaving all the users without support.”

[Dan Goodin](https://twitter.com/dangoodin001) at *Ars Technica* has [a fascinating deep dive](https://arstechnica.com/gadgets/2021/06/hackers-exploited-0-day-not-2018-bug-to-mass-wipe-my-book-live-devices/) on the other zero-day flaw that led to the mass attack last month on MyBook Live devices that Western Digital stopped supporting in 2015. In response to Goodin’s report, Western Digital acknowledged that the flaw was enabled by a Western Digital developer who removed code that required a valid user password before allowing factory resets to proceed.

Facing a backlash of angry customers, Western Digital also [pledged](https://www.westerndigital.com/support/productsecurity/wdc-21008-recommended-security-measures-wd-mybooklive-wd-mybookliveduo) to provide data recovery services to affected customers starting this month. “MyBook Live customers will also be eligible for a trade-in program so they can upgrade to MyCloud devices,” Goodin wrote. “A spokeswoman said the data recovery service will be free of charge.”

If attackers get around to exploiting this OS 3 bug, Western Digital might soon be paying for data recovery services and trade-ins for a whole lot more customers.

   This affects only the WD MyBook product line? If you have a WD MyPassport (ultra or other) it’s not affected, because that product is not set up to be reachable remotely over the Internet, correct?

   1. Mark [July 2, 2021](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/#comment-536078)

      This only affects WD devices that can connect directly to a network (i.e. NAS devices). USB-connected devices like the ones you mentioned are not affected by these bugs.

      Correct. My book live and my book cloud.

   Honestly.. Western Digital has a track record of atrocious software on their network attached devices. I remember getting a box of old tech with a WD NAS in it, and after a quick google, I turfed it into ewaste (after pulling out the drives) as it was a steaming pile of remotely compromisable cruft.

   They clearly want to have some network attached solutions to appeal to folks who want more than just device attached storage, but their heart clearly isn’t in it… just increasing the breadth of the product portfolio.

   Anybody that nowadays makes all their backup or whatever data accessible from the Internet simply through a half baked bundled OEM application is bound to be looking for trouble just like this. When will people finally realize that today’s Internet is the “Danger Zone”. For sure it ain’t Kansas anymore…

      How many people know or even care if they do know?

         I think the question we need to ask is do we expect all users to STOP USING the HW when the product EOL hits after a mere 4(!) years? That’s the proposition described, the security support ends with feature support. That should be decoupled IMO. Not all devices need to run the new 5 version, but the old ones should still have a rudimentary patch (it wouldn’t really cost that much, but it has a cost) to address the big flopping 0 days as discovered. If it’s something that can’t be overcome by a minor update maybe they’re off the hook, but this isn’t that. This is fixable. And I acknowledge they can’t support products forever – that’s not what I’m describing, just a priority shift towards a base-level secure state and separation of responsibility vis a vis major holes that are easily filled in 4-5 year old products, rather than artificially “deciding” that the only way to address it is landfill. Yes I’m calling for a higher legal standard than extant.

   I ordered 2 Mybook drives in January that were DOA and they didn’t have any stock left to replace them. There is nothing to worry about with standard usb wd drives? I have 4 of the mypassport ones.

    I find it interesting that WD will help with data recovery but ONLY if you buy (with trade-in) a new device from them. Translation: “We’re sorry you lost your precious family photos. We’ll be happy to get them back for you unless you decide you don’t want to (or are financially unable to) keep using our products.

       And what’s wrong with that. WD will help with data recovery on the understanding that you won’t just stick the recovered data right back onto the vulnerable devices and go through the same thing again. Because like it or not, there would be some users stupid enough to do just that. Translation: We’ll help you recover your data but only on the understanding that you will not be using your unsupported, obsolete WD NAS system to store that data so that you don’t (and we don’t) have to go through this again.
    3. William Kemmler [July 5, 2021](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/#comment-536220)

       Upon further investigation I cannot find where Western Digital is requiring people to buy a new WD NAS device in order to qualify for data recovery services. All I can find is the following statement(s):

       “Data Recovery and Product Trade-In Programs: To help customers who have lost data as a result of these attacks, Western Digital will provide data recovery services, which will be available beginning in July. My Book Live customers will also be offered a trade-in program to upgrade to a supported My Cloud device.”

       And the following:

       Neither of which state that in order to receive the data recovery assistance once must trade in or buy a new WD NAS device. So what is your exact source for your claim that a trade-in or purchase of a new WD NAS device is required.

    I mean, I get the discontent…But could you really even label this as incompetence? With “Nation States” that have enumerable resources dedicated to stealing any/all data…Should any company be held responsible for an exploit on out of warranty equipment especially if it’s 5 years out? If so, what is the time-line for accountability? Millennials always need someone to blame when something goes wrong…Maybe Millennials are what’s wrong…

    1. Ok Boomer [July 6, 2021](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/#comment-536261)

       Millennials would only set up these devices for their Boomer parents who don’t know or care to keep them updated.

       The “set it and forget it” mentality of the older generation is simply incompatible with modern threats.

       1. Mike [July 6, 2021](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/#comment-536267)

          I know more millennials with a “set it and forget it” mentality than “Boomer parents” with that mentality. Remember, it was boomers and GenXers who created the thing. Most of us who have been around since the days when 1200 baud modems were “state of the art” know better.

          It is the generation that was raised on iPhones and iThis and iThats that expect things to “just work” without putting in any effort that have led to most of this. All of that “just works” convenience has \*ALWAYS\* come at a security cost. But people have come to expect that computers will update themselves (because PCs and Macs do that. Even when you explicitly tell them not to; if you block their ability to do so, PCs will start complaining that you are running “unlicensed software”. It really goes hand in hand with the mentality that just accepts that we don’t own the software on our computing devices.

          In a world where we don’t own the software on our computing devices, and in particular, we don’t own the software on the computing device (it’s no accident that when you install or upgrade your software, you are presented with a \*\*LICENSING\*\* agreement…), then yeah, I’d say it’s the publisher’s responsibility to maintain their software. If you own a car, you don’t get to stop taking care of the brakes, and still expect it to run. So sure, if I \*own\* the software, then I should be expected to maintain it, but I am explicitly told I \*DO NOT\* own the software. So which is it? Do I own the software, or do I license the software?

          1. Right Gramps [July 6, 2021](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/#comment-536271)

             I doubt it. The “set it and forget it” mentality comes from household appliances that boomers invented for themselves.

             Now, they treat computers like appliances. They want all the cloud benefits, but don’t understand that the cloud isn’t magic.

             “But people have come to expect that computers will update themselves”

             Um… no. We understand when devices prompt to be updated. We don’t call our kids every time a popup says to confirm an update like you guys.

             What are you talking about? What’s your definition of “owning”. Rights to the intellectual property? Being allowed to distribute software? Or just buying the rights to operate a single instance of the software? If you write software, and sell it… do you think whoever buys a license to use it, should be entitled to indefinite support?

             The car analogy is better one. When a car goes out of warranty… the owner still has to periodically check for recall notices.
    3. Mike [July 6, 2021](https://krebsonsecurity.com/2021/07/another-0-day-looms-for-many-western-digital-users/#comment-536268)

       I think when WD published software that deliberately disabled even basic protection like a password check… yeah, they’re responsible for that. Obviously, that update was published before they went out of warranty. They should at least be required to fix \*that\* bit of stupidity.

       If the update that disabled password authentication for admin tasks happened to be published in the days leading up to the product going out of warranty… that’s \*at least\* borderline criminal. It would likely be \*really\* hard to prove that it was intentional, but that the sort of thing that even if it wasn’t intentional could destroy a company.

       Note that I’m not saying that particular things \*was\* published just before they went out of warranty; I have no way to know when that entered the source code. One could probably look at the modification date in the firmware and make an educated guess, but I don’t have one of these devices (and if I did, I’d have replaced the factory OS as soon as I could figure out how. I don’t even run stock firmware on my WiFi routers if I can help it (and I always purchase units that I can reflash…) )

    Given that physical storage companies think of firmware as something that can be deprecated and no longer supported, it seems like we should be relying on the firmware for as little as possible (performant I/O directly through a standard interface). Build the NAS or other solution via software on top, with those solutions presumably have much longer support timelines, and better migration paths when they reach deprecation status?

    I updated my firmware to 2.41.116 but since I don’t agree with the TOS to use the new browser interface I can’t log in to jump to v5.

    I disabled all apps and access to the cloud on original install and put a block rule from my LAN IP in my router so I don’t feel exposed.

    I am curious I don’t really see anyone talking about the possibility of shucking these drives and putting them in a new USB 3 enclosure. I am assuming that would mitigate the security vulnerability.
