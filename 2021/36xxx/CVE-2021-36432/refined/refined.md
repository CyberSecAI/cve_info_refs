The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the jocms project.

**Vulnerability 1:**

*   **Root cause:** Unsanitized user-controlled input (`$decoded["id"]`) is directly embedded into an SQL query in the `jo_get_masks()` function within `jocms/apps/mask/inc/mask.php`.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted JSON payload with a malicious `id` value via POST request to `jocms/apps/mask/inc/mask.php`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker can send POST requests to the server and control the `id` parameter of JSON input.
*  **Payload example:** `{"id":"1'union select 1,'hacked',3,sqlite_version(),5--"}`

**Vulnerability 2:**

*   **Root cause:** Similar to vulnerability 1, unsanitized user-controlled input (`$decoded["content"]`) is directly embedded into an SQL query in the `jo_get_masks()` function, but in `jocms/apps/mask/inc/getmask.php`.
*  **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Same as vulnerability 1 - arbitrary SQL query execution.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted JSON payload with a malicious `content` value via POST request to `jocms/apps/mask/inc/getmask.php`.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker can send POST requests to the server and control the `content` parameter of JSON input.
*   **Payload example:** `{"content":"1'union select 1,'hacked',3,sqlite_version(),5--"}`

**Vulnerability 3:**

*   **Root cause:** Unsanitized user-controlled inputs (`$_POST["id"]`, `$_POST["name"]`, `$_POST["code"]`) are used in the `jo_set_mask()` function within `jocms/core/inc/db.php` without proper sanitization or escaping.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or arbitrary code execution. The attacker is able to write php code to the database.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted POST request to `jocms/apps/mask/mask.php` with malicious `id`, `name`, and `code` parameters.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker can send POST requests to the server and control the `id`, `name` and `code` parameters.
*   **Payload example:** `saved=a&id=1';ATTACH DATABASE 'shell.php' AS test ;create TABLE test.exp (dataz text) ; insert INTO test.exp (dataz) VALUES ('<?php phpinfo()?>');&name=xxxxxxx&code=xxxxxxxx`

**Vulnerability 4:**

*   **Root cause:** Unsanitized user-controlled input (`$_GET["id"]`) is used in the `jo_delete_mask()` function within `jocms/core/inc/db.php` without sanitization or escaping.
*   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability.
*   **Impact:** Attackers can inject arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to data breaches, data manipulation, or denial of service, Time-based injection can be exploited.
*   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted GET request to `jocms/apps/mask/mask.php` with a malicious `id` parameter.
*   **Required Capabilities:** The attacker can send GET requests to the server and control the `id` parameter.
*   **Payload example:** `?deleted=x&id=0'or+case+when(1=2)+then(randomblob(1000000000))else(0)end+or+'`
