Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-36787:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the "femanager" TYPO3 extension allowing the upload of SVG files by default when a logged-in frontend user uploads a new profile image. This is a insecure default behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The core issue is the ability to upload SVG files containing embedded JavaScript code, which is then stored on the server. When these SVG files are rendered as profile images, the embedded JavaScript executes within the user's browser, leading to XSS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into an SVG file.
- **Account Takeover/Data Theft:** When other users view the attacker's profile, the malicious JavaScript executes in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities. The impact depends on the actions coded in the malicious Javascript.
- **Website Defacement:** Malicious JavaScript could potentially deface the website or redirect users to malicious sites.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **File Upload:** The primary attack vector is the file upload functionality within the "femanager" extension during the frontend user registration process.
- **SVG File with Embedded JavaScript:** The attacker crafts a malicious SVG file containing JavaScript code designed for malicious purposes.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Frontend User Account:** The attacker needs to be a registered frontend user of the affected TYPO3 website.
- **Ability to Upload Files:** The attacker needs the ability to upload profile images within the "femanager" extension's user profile management or registration form.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability affects versions 6.0.0 to 6.3.0 and 5.5.0 and below of the "femanager" extension.
- The vulnerability was fixed in versions 6.3.1 and 5.5.1 of the extension.
- The official advisory recommends updating to the patched versions and suggests using the `svg_sanitizer` extension, or implementing a strict Content Security Policy for SVG uploads, if SVG uploads are necessary for website functionality.
