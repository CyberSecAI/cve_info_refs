Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-36776:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the Steve API proxy component of Rancher. It does not properly drop the impersonation header before forwarding requests to the Kubernetes API.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Improper Authorization Check:** The Steve API proxy fails to remove the impersonation header, leading to a lack of proper authorization checks when interacting with the Kubernetes API. This allows an attacker to potentially bypass authorization controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Privilege Escalation:** An authenticated user can impersonate any other user within the cluster without requiring knowledge of the impersonated user's credentials. This allows an attacker to escalate their privileges to that of the impersonated user.
*   **Complete Cluster Control:** A malicious user could impersonate an administrator within Rancher and gain administrator-level access to the cluster, granting them full control.
*   **Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact:** The vulnerability has a high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability due to the potential for complete control over the cluster.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network-based:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network through Rancher's Steve API.
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs valid authenticated access to the Rancher service to exploit this vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker must be an authenticated user with access to Rancher.
*   The attacker does not require knowledge of the impersonated user's credentials.

**Additional details:**

*   **Affected Versions:** Rancher versions 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.9 are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:** The vulnerability is patched in Rancher versions 2.5.10, 2.6.0, and later releases.
*   **Workarounds:** The only effective workaround is to limit access in Rancher to trusted users and upgrading to the patched Rancher version. There's no direct mitigation apart from upgrading.

**CVSS Metrics:**
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.8
*   **Attack Vector:** Network (AV:N)
*   **Attack Complexity:** Low (AC:L)
*   **Privileges Required:** Low (PR:L)
*   **User Interaction:** None (UI:N)
*   **Scope:** Unchanged (S:U)
*   **Confidentiality:** High (C:H)
*   **Integrity:** High (I:H)
*   **Availability:** High (A:H)

**CWE:**
* CWE-285: Improper Authorization
