{
  "CVE-2021-36409": {
    "Description": "There is an Assertion `scaling_list_pred_matrix_id_delta==1' failed at sps.cc:925 in libde265 v1.0.8 when decoding file, which allows attackers to cause a Denial of Service (DoS) by running the application with a crafted file or possibly have unspecified other impact.",
    "Root cause": "An assertion failure occurs at sps.cc:925 when the value of `scaling_list_pred_matrix_id_delta` is not equal to 1 during the decoding of a crafted HEVC video file.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of scaling list prediction matrix delta values in the HEVC decoder.",
      "Missing input validation or proper error handling leading to an assertion failure."
    ],
    "Impact": "Denial of service (DoS) due to program termination (abort) when decoding a crafted HEVC file. The possibility of unspecified other impact is also mentioned.",
    "Attack vectors": [
      "Crafted HEVC video file that triggers the assertion failure."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities/position": "An attacker needs to provide a crafted HEVC video file to the vulnerable application (libde265) to trigger the assertion failure."
  }
