How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.

I recently updated my theme to be as state of the art as I can be. Their search sucked. It was only searching woo products and yet I have over a thousand articles on mmy blog that is the life blood of my natural products business. So. I discovered Ivory in desparation because my theme developers do not seem to get it. Now I have a full search engine that fits my needs and is relavant.
Keep up the good work Ivory!

This is a really great plugin. It allowed me to create a ADA-compliant Search field where I want. However, the best feature is the author. I asked several questions, and he kindly send me the CSS code to implement my requests. Nice! I highly recommend Ivory Search.
