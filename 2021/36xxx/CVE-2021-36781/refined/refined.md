The provided content is related to CVE-2021-36781.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the parsec package installing a systemd-tmpfiles configuration that sets insecure permissions (777) for the `/run/parsec` directory. This directory is intended to hold a UNIX domain socket used by the parsec service for client connections.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Insecure directory permissions:** The world-writable (777) permission on `/run/parsec` allows any local user to modify the directory's contents.
- **UNIX domain socket hijacking:** An attacker can replace the legitimate UNIX domain socket with a malicious one.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Man-in-the-middle:** A local attacker can intercept and manipulate communication between parsec clients and the service by redirecting connections to an imposter service.
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** An attacker can cause the service to malfunction or become unusable by disrupting its normal operation, such as by echoing requests back to clients resulting in a client error and broken functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access: The attacker needs to be a local user on the system where the parsec service is running.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have local user access with the ability to write to the `/run/parsec` directory
