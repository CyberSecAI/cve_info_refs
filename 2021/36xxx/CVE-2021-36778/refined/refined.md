Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36778:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   An insufficient check of the same-origin policy when downloading Helm charts from a configured private repository in Rancher.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Exposure of Credentials:** The vulnerability leads to the exposure of repository credentials to third-party providers.
*   **Insufficient Same-Origin Check:** The lack of proper validation when following redirects or downloading external resources allows for the leakage of credentials. Specifically, the issue arises when a private repository:
    1.  HTTP redirects to a third-party.
    2.  Downloads an icon resource from a third-party provider.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Leakage:** The primary impact is the exposure of private repository credentials in the HTTP `Authorization` header (base64 encoded).
*   **Potential for Unauthorized Access:**  Compromised credentials could allow attackers to access the private repository.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploitable over the network.
*   **Specifically**: This happens when Rancher is configured to use a private repository in "Apps & Marketplace > Repositories". When downloading helm charts, the application fails to properly check if the redirects or resources being downloaded match the same domain origin, thus leaking the credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **No Special Privileges:** An attacker does not require any special privileges on the target system to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **No User Interaction:**  No user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** An attacker needs to be able to interact with the Rancher instance and the potentially malicious third-party server.
*   **Malicious Third Party Server**: An attacker needs to control the third-party server that is used for the redirect or for the resources.

**Additional Notes**

*   **Affected Versions:** Rancher versions 2.5.0 up to and including 2.5.11 and from 2.6.0 up to and including 2.6.2 are affected.
*   **Patched Versions:**  The vulnerability is fixed in Rancher versions 2.5.12, 2.6.3, and later releases.
*   **Workarounds:** The provided workarounds include upgrading Rancher, checking Helm charts for redirects, and evaluating/changing affected credentials.
*   **CVSS Score:** The vulnerability has a CVSS v3 base score of 7.3, classified as "High" severity.
*  **CWE**: The identified weakness is CWE-200 (Exposure of Sensitive Information to an Unauthorized Actor).
