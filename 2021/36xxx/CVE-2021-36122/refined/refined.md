**Summary of Vulnerabilities in ShareCare Application (Version 8.15.5)**

*   **SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application concatenates user-supplied input directly into SQL queries without sanitization or parameterization using the `cfquery` tag in ColdFusion Markup Language (CFML). This occurs when retrieving records using URL parameters and session validation logic.
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input sanitization, direct concatenation of user input into SQL queries, use of `LIKE` operator in session validation making session hijacking easier.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** Allows attackers to bypass authentication, exfiltrate sensitive SQL records, manipulate data, and potentially achieve remote compromise. Session hijacking is possible without SQL injection due to use of `LIKE` operator.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating URL parameters (e.g., `menu_ID`) and `SCToken` session cookie by supplying SQL wildcards.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote, unauthenticated user can achieve SQL injection and session hijacking.

*   **Local File Inclusion:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/General/TextReader/TextReader.cfm` script accepts file paths in the `textFile` parameter without proper validation or sanitization.
    *  **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of input validation or sanitization for file paths.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** Attackers can read arbitrary files on the serverâ€™s file system, including files accessible via UNC paths.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Manipulating the `textFile` parameter with file system paths or UNC paths.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote, authenticated user.

*   **Improper Authorization:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Inconsistent application of authentication and authorization checks for sensitive pages.
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Some sensitive pages are accessible without authentication, exposing them to unauthenticated attacks, such as SQL injection.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** Unauthenticated users can access pages vulnerable to SQL injection, leading to potential remote compromise and patient data leaks.
    *   **Attack Vectors:** Direct access to the unauthenticated sensitive pages, such as `/General/UserInterface/submenus.cfm`, `/General/UserInterface/JobClockCheck_Sel.cfm`, `/General/UserInterface/JobClockDisplay_Sel.cfm`, `/General/UserInterface/helpDictionaryGet.cfm`, `/General/UserInterface/helpContent.cfm`, `/General/UserInterface/TabBar.cfm`.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote, unauthenticated user.

*   **Unrestricted File Upload:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/Access/DownloadFeed_Mnt/FileUpload_Upd.cfm` script inadequately filters file names provided in the `name1` parameter.
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Inadequate filtering of forward slashes ( `/` ) as path delimiters, which bypasses the backslash ( `\` ) filter.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** Allows attackers to upload arbitrary files to any location on the `Z:` drive (where the application resides) and execute code as the ShareCare service user (`NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM`).
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  Manipulating the `name1` parameter with path traversal sequences using forward slashes.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote, authenticated user.

*   **Command Argument Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The `/Access/EligFeedParse_Sup/UnzipFile_Upd.cfm` script executes `7z.exe` with a password parameter, `Form.zippass`, without proper sanitization.
    *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Lack of sanitization for the `Form.zippass` parameter passed to `7z.exe`.
    *   **Impact of Exploitation:** Allows injection of arbitrary command arguments to `7z.exe`.
    *   **Attack Vectors:**  Manipulating the `Form.zippass` parameter.
    *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** Remote, authenticated user.

**Mitigation:**
The vulnerabilities were addressed in ShareCare version 9.0.1.
