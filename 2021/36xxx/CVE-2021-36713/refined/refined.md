Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36713:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The provided content directly relates to CVE-2021-36713. Specifically, the NetApp advisory `NTAP-20230406-0003` explicitly mentions "CVE-2021-36713 jQuery Vulnerability in NetApp Products". The provided code snippet, attributed to walhajri, also confirms this vulnerability in the specified version of the `DataTables` plugin.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `_fnCreateCookie` function of the DataTables plugin (version 1.9.2), specifically how it processes the `sBaseName` parameter.  If a website exposes this parameter to user input, an attacker can inject malicious Javascript code via a cookie. This occurs due to the use of `eval()` on a value obtained from `document.cookie`
*   **Weakness/Vulnerability:** Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The vulnerability stems from the use of  `eval()` to process potentially user-controlled data from cookies.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** A successful exploit could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of a vulnerable web page. This could lead to:
    *   Disclosure of sensitive information accessible within the application.
    *   Addition or modification of data within the application.
    *   Redirection to malicious sites.
    *   Other malicious actions depending on the context of the application.
*   **Attack Vector:**  An attacker crafts a malicious cookie with the name "XSS" (in the provided PoC) or another name if `sBaseName` is exposed and injects it into a victim's browser. The vulnerable javascript code, running client-side, then parses and executes this code due to the use of `eval()`.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject a cookie into the victim's browser and for a vulnerable web page containing the vulnerable version of DataTables and where the `sBaseName` is exposed.

**3. Additional details beyond the CVE Description**

*   The vulnerability is present in `DataTables` plugin version 1.9.2.
*   The NetApp advisory lists several specific NetApp products affected, and also the ones that are not affected.
*   The provided content also includes  a PoC that demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by setting a malicious cookie.
*  The NetApp advisory (NTAP-20230406-0003) notes that a fix is available for SnapCenter. However, other products including *NetApp Cloud Backup OST Plug-in*, *NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H300S/H500S/H700S/H410S*, *NetApp HCI Baseboard Management Controller (BMC) - H410C*, *NetApp Virtual Desktop Service (VDS)*, and *Spot PC* are listed as "Won't Fix".

In summary, the content provides a clear understanding of the vulnerability, its root cause, potential impact, and how it can be exploited. It also gives specific details about which NetApp products are affected and provides links to patches where available.
