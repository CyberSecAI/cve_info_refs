# Security patch is now available.

### (1.1) Originally by Richard Hipp ([drh](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=drh)) with edits by Stephan Beal ([stephan](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=stephan)) on 2021-06-15 09:57:56 from [1.0](/forum/forumpost/7d9edca410?hist) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/8d367e16f53d93c7?raw)

It has been discovered that the client-side TLS implementation in Fossil was
often failing to verify that the hostname of the server matched the hostname
contained in the TLS certificate. Hence, an "https" connection would always
work as long as the server returned any valid certificate, even if that
certificate did not match the hostname.

This problem has now been patched on trunk, and on the 2.15 and 2.14 branches.

Fresh downloads are available on the [download page](https://fossil-scm.org/home/uv/download.html). Though not a crisis,
upgrading is recommended. Make sure you are using one of the following
versions of Fossil (in order of preference):

* Builds from any check-in dated 2021-06-15 or later
* Version 2.15.2
* Version 2.14.2

(edited by Stephan to correct version number.)

Shouldn't this be 2.14.2 ?

Correct. Fixed!

It was discussed in the developers' chatroom.

Hi,

I package fossil for OpenBSD and updating our port for 2.15.2. It seems tarballs are no longer being uploaded to https://fossil-scm.org/home/uv/ like with previous releases.

I'm guessing the new /home/tarball/ urls are generating the tarballs on the fly which is never a good idea for those of use who create ports that ship checksums. Also I've noticed https://fossil-scm.org/home/tarball/fossil-2.15.2.tar.gz?r=version-2.15.2 and https://fossil-scm.org/home/tarball/fossil-2.15.2.tar.gz yield different size packages.

This was being fixed right about the time you posted. Please try again.

Edit:

> I'm guessing the new /home/tarball/ urls are generating the tarballs on the fly which is never a good idea for those of use who create ports that ship checksums.

Based on a comment in the chatroom, that is now exactly what is happening in order to avoid having to retain X copies of old, large binaries as unversioned state. The tarballs should be byte-for-byte identical on each rebuild. The metadata for the included files, including their timestamps, is based on their repo-side state.

> Also I've noticed https://fossil-scm.org/home/tarball/fossil-2.15.2.tar.gz?r=version-2.15.2 and https://fossil-scm.org/home/tarball/fossil-2.15.2.tar.gz yield different size packages.

They are different. One of the side effects of building from a tag (the first link) is that you get the latest version of that tag:

```
$ cat f2/manifest.uuid f1/manifest.uuid
e0ebe6f0338825affb13e19d3f9c2af96c292ca73308a5d7dc38d7e9ec03cfbd

```

Thanks, I see the uploaded tarball now!

> The tarballs should be byte-for-byte identical on each rebuild.

The tarball content should be identical. But, if we recompile fossil
with an updated version of zlib, does that mean that the compression might
be a little different, and thus the compressed tarball might not be
byte-for-byte the same?

Does that matter?

In the [SQLite README.md file](https://sqlite.org/src/file/README.md), near the bottom, I have a paragraph that
describes how to verify the integrity of an SQLite source tarball by referencing
the SHA1 and SHA3 hashes in the "manifest" file. Should we perhaps provide
a utility program, or a new Fossil command, or both, that verifies the
integrity of a tarball or ZIP archive based on the manifest file contained
within that archive?

### (10) By Richard Hipp ([drh](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=drh)) on 2021-06-16 03:01:52 in reply to [9](/forum/forumpost/25de76ea7b) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/3af466b195ebe088) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/3af466b195ebe088?raw)

Maybe we need a "sha3sum" type of program that operates directly on a
tarball or ZIP archive, but instead of blindly hashing the bytes of the
archive, instead hashes the archive content. Such a "content-hash" would
always be the same, even if the archive is recomputed using a different
version of zlib.

### (11) By [ravbc](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=ravbc) on 2021-06-16 08:01:17 in reply to [10](/forum/forumpost/3af466b195) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/ba0b034ad00a39cb) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/ba0b034ad00a39cb?raw)

This won't help distributions - they keep a checksum of a source package on their
side, just to be sure that whenever (and wherever) a given version of packaged
software is build, it is always compiled from exactly the same source. And they
probably wouldn't want to change own packaging framework to accommodate just to
fossils packaging "quirks". Especially when providing static tarball isn't very
tedious. Just my $0.03. ;-)

### (12.1) By Richard Hipp ([drh](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=drh)) on 2021-06-16 13:43:45 edited from [12.0](/forum/forumpost/39ecf58d5b?hist) in reply to [9](/forum/forumpost/25de76ea7b) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/59b6fc60221ddc5b) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/59b6fc60221ddc5b?raw)

The links to the source tarballs on the download page were originally
coded like this:

> **/tarball/***filename***?r=***tag*

For example:

> ```
> /tarball/fossil-src-2.15.2?r=version-2.15.2
>
> ```

But with that encoding, anything tagged as "version-2.15.2" might be
downloaded. Any developer could add the tag "version-2.15.2" to any
check-in and that would case the tagged check-in to be downloaded.

We prefer that the Download page only deliver the official release.
To enforce this, the download link for the source tarballs has been
changed to follow this template:

> **/tarball/***full-SHA3-hash***/***filename*

For example:

> /tarball/7cfd58d771e77123dcccfce67da9da633fdba912b6e7019a84912146aa8f06ba/fossil-2.15.2.tar.gz

This causes check-in 7cfd58d771e77 to be delivered always. It is not possible to
surreptitiously change the deliverable by adjusting tags.
