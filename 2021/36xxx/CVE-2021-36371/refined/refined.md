The provided content describes a vulnerability related to mTLS bypass in Emissary Ingress versions prior to 2.0.0, specifically versions 1.7.2 and 1.13.2.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises from the way Emissary Ingress handles TLSContexts and Host headers. It matches TLSContexts based on the Server Name Indication (SNI) during the TLS handshake, but matches mappings based on the Host header in the HTTP request. This discrepancy allows an attacker to bypass mTLS requirements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **mTLS Bypass:** An attacker can bypass mTLS by sending an SNI for a TLSContext that does not require mTLS, while sending a Host header that corresponds to a mapping that requires mTLS.
- **Catch-all Filter:** Emissary Ingress uses a catch-all TLS filter that applies every mapping to a wildcard virtual host. This allows for routes to be accessible even if the SNI does not match the intended TLSContext.
- **Default TLSContext fallback:** If no SNI is given, the system falls back on a default TLSContext. If this default context does not require mTLS, it can be exploited.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can access backend services that require mTLS without presenting a valid client certificate, potentially gaining unauthorized access to sensitive data or functionality.

**Attack vectors:**
- **SNI Spoofing:** By sending a valid SNI for a TLSContext that doesn't require mTLS and then specifying a `Host` header that matches a protected resource, an attacker can bypass mTLS.
- **Direct Connection without SNI:** If the default TLSContext does not require mTLS, an attacker can connect directly to the Ambassador LoadBalancer IP address without specifying any SNI and still bypass mTLS for resources that require it based on the host header.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Emissary Ingress load balancer.
- The attacker needs to be able to manipulate the `Host` header in the HTTP request and the SNI during the TLS handshake.
- The attacker can be external or internal as long as they can reach the load balancer.

The content also mentions mitigations such as:
- Ensuring that none of the `Host`s completely disable mTLS.
- Enabling external authentication.
- Defining a wildcard host with restrictive TLS settings and setting `prune_unreachable_hosts: true`
- Upgrading to version 2.0.0 which fixes this vulnerability
