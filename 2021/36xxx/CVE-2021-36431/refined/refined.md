The provided content describes multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the `jocms` project.

**Root Cause:** The root cause of these vulnerabilities is the lack of proper sanitization or parameterization of user-supplied input before being used in SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **SQL Injection in `jocms/apps/mask/inc/mask.php`:** The `jo_get_masks()` function directly incorporates the `id` parameter from a JSON payload into a SQL query without sanitization. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
2.  **SQL Injection in `jocms/apps/mask/inc/getmask.php`:** Similar to the previous case, the `content` parameter from a JSON payload is directly used in a SQL query within the `jo_get_masks()` function, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.
3.  **SQL Injection in `jocms/apps/mask/mask.php` (via `jo_set_mask`):**  The `jo_set_mask()` function in `jocms/core/inc/db.php` does not sanitize `name`, `code`, or `id` parameters before including them in an SQL query, leading to a SQL injection vulnerability.
4.  **SQL Injection in `jocms/apps/mask/mask.php` (via `jo_delete_mask`):** The `jo_delete_mask()` function directly uses the `id` parameter from a GET request in a SQL query without sanitization, making it vulnerable to SQL injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries, potentially leading to:
    *   Data exfiltration: Extracting sensitive information from the database.
    *   Data modification: Altering or deleting data in the database.
    *   Privilege escalation: Potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system.
    *   Arbitrary Code Execution: In the third vulnerability, the attacker can write a php file to the server.
    *   Denial of Service: The fourth vulnerability allows for time-based injection which can result in denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   Sending crafted JSON payloads via POST requests (vulnerabilities 1 & 2).
*   Sending crafted POST requests with specific parameters (vulnerability 3).
*   Sending crafted GET requests with specific parameters (vulnerability 4).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No authentication is required to exploit the SQL injection vulnerabilities described, though the attacker would need to know the specific URLs and parameter names of the vulnerable endpoints.
