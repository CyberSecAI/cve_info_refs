Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36309:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability exists due to sensitive information disclosure in Dell Enterprise SONiC OS versions 3.3.0 and earlier. Specifically, TACACS/Radius credentials are being stored in a way that can be accessed by a malicious user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive information disclosure:  TACACS/Radius credentials are not securely stored, allowing access to them.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An authenticated malicious user, with access to the system, can use the disclosed TACACS/Radius credentials.
- This can lead to further attacks, including unauthorized access to other systems or data within the network.
- The impact is classified as High, with potential compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is Adjacent Network (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated on the affected system (PR:L - Low Privileges).
- The attack doesn't require any user interaction (UI:N)
- The attacker must be positioned on the same network segment or have adjacent network access.

**CVSS Vector String:**
CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
(Adjacent Network, High Attack Complexity, Low Privileges Required, No User Interaction, Unchanged Scope, High Confidentiality Impact, High Integrity Impact, High Availability Impact)

**Affected Products:**
- Dell Enterprise SONiC OS versions 3.3.0 and earlier

**Resolution:**
- Upgrade to Dell Enterprise SONiC OS version 3.4.0 or later.
