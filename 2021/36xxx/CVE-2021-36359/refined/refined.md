Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36359:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The BSCW Server application allows users to export objects to PDF files using the `exportpdf` package and the ReportLab library.
*   The application fails to properly encode user-provided content before passing it to the ReportLab library.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XML Tag Injection:** The lack of proper encoding allows attackers to inject arbitrary XML tags into the content that is processed by ReportLab.
*   **Python Code Execution:** By injecting specific tags like `<unichar code="...">`, attackers can execute arbitrary Python code.
*   **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF):**  Vulnerable versions of ReportLab (prior to 3.5.55) allow for SSRF attacks using the `<img>` tag. This was not the main focus of the report but is noted as a related issue.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Python Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary Python code on the server by injecting malicious XML tags, potentially leading to complete system compromise.
*   **SSRF (depending on ReportLab version):** Attackers can make requests to internal services or external systems, potentially revealing sensitive information or compromising other systems.
*   **Information Disclosure:**  The injection of `unichar` can be used to exfiltrate information by writing ASCII characters to the generated PDF.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **User-supplied input:** The vulnerability is triggered by user-controlled input (e.g., folder descriptions) that is passed to the ReportLab library without proper sanitization.
*   **Export to PDF functionality:** The attack vector requires the use of the "Send To -> File(PDF)" functionality within the BSCW application.
*   **Specific XML tags:** The attacker needs to inject specific XML tags understood by ReportLab (e.g., `<unichar>`,`<img>`, etc.) to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Low-privileged user:** A user with low privileges in the BSCW system is sufficient to exploit the vulnerability, as they can modify folder descriptions which are then used in the PDF export.
*   **Access to BSCW server:** The attacker needs network access to the BSCW server to interact with the application.
*   **Knowledge of ReportLab tags:** The attacker needs to be aware of ReportLab's supported tags and their behavior to construct malicious payloads.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory includes a proof-of-concept demonstrating code execution by injecting the `<unichar>` tag.
*   The vulnerability was discovered in BSCW Classic 5.2.3, and the vendor confirmed it affects other versions as well.
*   The advisory recommends upgrading to a patched version of BSCW Server or disabling the export to PDF functionality.
*   The advisory suggests ensuring that the used `ReportLab` version is >= `3.5.55` to mitigate the SSRF aspect.
