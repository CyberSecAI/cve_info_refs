Business recommendation:
------------------------
The vendor provides a patched version for the affected products, which should
be installed immediately.

Vulnerability overview/description:
-----------------------------------
1) XML Tag injection
The application allows a user with low privileges to export different objects
to a `PDF` file (`Send To -> File(PDF)`) via the `exportpdf` package. To
export the content of the objects the framework ReportLab is used. This library
supports different tags to export structured content:

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# File: reportlab/platypus/paraparser.py
 !!! NOTE !!! THIS TEXT IS NOW REPLICATED IN PARAGRAPH.PY !!!
 The ParaFormatter will be able to format the following
 tags:
       < /b > - bold
       < /i > - italics
       < u [color="red"] [width="pts"] [offset="pts"]> < /u > - underline
           width and offset can be empty meaning use existing canvas line width
           or with an f/F suffix regarded as a fraction of the font size
       < strike > < /strike > - strike through has the same parameters as underline
       < super [size="pts"] [rise="pts"]> < /super > - superscript
       < sup ="pts"] [rise="pts"]> < /sup > - superscript
       < sub ="pts"] [rise="pts"]> < /sub > - subscript
       <font name=fontfamily/fontname color=colorname size=float>
        <span name=fontfamily/fontname color=colorname backcolor=colorname size=float style=stylename>
       < bullet > </bullet> - bullet text (at head of para only)
       <onDraw name=callable label="a label"/>
       <index [name="callablecanvasattribute"] label="a label"/>
       <link>link text</link>
           attributes of links
               size/fontSize/uwidth/uoffset=num
               name/face/fontName=name
               fg/textColor/color/ucolor=color
               backcolor/backColor/bgcolor=color
               dest/destination/target/href/link=target
               underline=bool turn on underline
       <a>anchor text</a>
           attributes of anchors
               fontSize=num
               fontName=name
               fg/textColor/color=color
               backcolor/backColor/bgcolor=color
               href=href
       <a name="anchorpoint"/>
       <unichar name="unicode character name"/>
       <unichar value="unicode code point"/>
       <img src="path" width="1in" height="1in" valign="bottom"/>
               width="w%" --> fontSize*w/100   idea from Roberto Alsina
               height="h%" --> linewidth*h/100 <ralsina () netmanagers com ar>
       <greek> - </greek>
       <nobr> ... </nobr> turn off word breaking and hyphenation

       The whole may be surrounded by <para> </para> tags
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The application does not properly encode the user content before passing it to
`ReportLab`, which allows the user to inject own tags. These tags get evaluated
by the `ReportLab`.

Depending on the version of `ReportLab` it allows the user to do a `SSRF`
(server side request forgery) attack via the `img` tag
(<https://snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-PYTHON-REPORTLAB-1022145>).

There are also known vulnerabilites in `ReportLab`:

* <https://www.cybersecurity-help.cz/vdb/SB2019101613>
* <https://hg.reportlab.com/hg-public/reportlab/rev/b117091a73c2>

This allows an attacker to execute `Python` code via the `unichar` tag or the
`color` attribute.

Proof of concept:
-----------------
1) XML Tag injection
One possible injection point is the `description` of a folder. Using the
following payload allows the execution of the `Python` code `28+20`.

<strike>hello</strike><unichar code="28+20"/>

The result of this code is `48` (ASCII: `0`), which gets written to the
generated `PDF` file.

-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The vulnerable code in the `ReportLab` framework:
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# File: reportlab\platypus\paraparser.py
def start_unichar(self, attr):
   if 'name' in attr:
      if 'code' in attr:
            self._syntax_error('<unichar/> invalid with both name and code attributes')
      try:
            v = unicodedata.lookup(attr['name'])
      except KeyError:
            self._syntax_error('<unichar/> invalid name attribute\n"%s"' % ascii(attr['name']))
            v = '\0'
   elif 'code' in attr:
      try:
            v = int(eval(attr['code']))
            v = chr(v) if isPy3 else unichr(v)
      except:
            self._syntax_error('<unichar/> invalid code attribute %s' % ascii(attr['code']))
            v = '\0'
-------------------------------------------------------------------------------
Most likely there are more injection points to include own tags, but no further
actions were taken to find them.

Vulnerable / tested versions:
-----------------------------
BSCW Classic 5.2.3 has been used to identify the vulnerability.

The vendor confirmed the following versions to be also affected by the
vulnerability:
BSCW Server <=5.0.11, <=5.1.9, <=5.2.3, <=7.3.2, <=7.4.2

Vendor contact timeline:
------------------------
2021-07-31: Sent report to vendor.
2021-08-01: Vendor confirmed the issue and is working on a patch.
2021-08-19: Vendor notified licensed customers about the issue and a patch.
2021-08-27: Coordinated release of security advisory.

Solution:
---------
The vendor provides a patched version for the affected and supported products,
which should be installed immediately.

Additional information can be viewed at the vendor's support page.

Workaround:
-----------
Ensure the the used `ReportLab` version is >= `3.5.55` to mitigiate an active
exploit of these known vulnerabilites.
It is also possbile to disable the `Export to PDF` function. This should be the
preferred way, until the vendor provides a patch.

$ bin/bsadmin package -d exportpdf

# Groupware made in Germany

## We develop software that works for people

Partners

**How it all began…**

In 1995, in an era of technological advancement and digital revolution, the core product BSCW was unveiled at a conference. This groundbreaking tool was the result of tireless work and dedication by scientists and engineers at GMD (now Fraunhofer). The BSCW system, a pioneer in the world of groupware and Internet technologies, was to change the way people collaborate and communicate.

![](https://www.bscw.de/wp-content/uploads/2017/12/1732627239260-1024x691.jpg)Company headquarters of OrbiTeam Software GmbH & Co. KG in Bonn, Germany

OrbiTeam Software was founded in 1998 to do justice to this revolutionary technology and exploit its full potential. As a spin-off of the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology (FIT), OrbiTeam can concentrate fully on the further development and marketing of the BSCW Shared Workspace System. The founding fathers of OrbiTeam were pioneers in the field of Internet applications and groupware-based systems who contributed their knowledge and expertise to continuously improve and adapt the BSCW system.

OrbiTeam’s employees have many years of in-depth knowledge in the planning and development of advanced Internet applications and groupware-based systems. Thanks to the close cooperation with the Fraunhofer Institute and their dedication to the continuous development and maintenance of the BSCW system, OrbiTeam is able to implement individual adaptations and extensions to the system quickly and efficiently.

![](/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/orbiteam.png)

**Reliable partner for 30 years**

OrbiTeam works closely with the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT, which has been engaged in the development of collaborative support systems for almost 30 years.

**Joint projects**

The central information system **EnArgus** ([www.enargus.de](https://www.enargus.de/)) for the advancement of energy research provides project initiators, the government and the public uniform and centralized access to information regarding research activities in the area of energy in Germany. This platform thus helps to make government funding policies in the area of energy research more transparent.

The **CloudTeams**([www.cloudteams.eu](https://www.fit.fraunhofer.de/en/fb/cscw/projects/cloudteams.html)) collaboration platform is an EU-sponsored project developed under the leadership of the Fraunhofer Institute for Applied Information Technology FIT. The team platform component that is used by software developers is an adapted and enhanced version of the BSCW system.

**Collaboration beyond the borders of the enterprise**

OrbiTeam is proud to partner with well-known European research institutes and innovative IT companies in developing and marketing the BSCW system:
