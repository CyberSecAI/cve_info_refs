- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "lost password" feature in OTRS allows an attacker to enumerate valid user logins.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** User enumeration vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious attacker can discover valid user logins by utilizing the "lost password" feature. This information can be used in subsequent attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** Network-based attack through the "lost password" feature.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any prior authentication or access to the system. They can initiate the attack through the publicly accessible "lost password" functionality.
