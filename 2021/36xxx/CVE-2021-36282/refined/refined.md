Based on the provided document, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-36282:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Use of an uninitialized resource. Specifically, the vulnerability lies in how Dell EMC PowerScale OneFS handles resources, leading to the potential exposure of uninitialized data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Use of Uninitialized Resource:** The core weakness is the failure to properly initialize a resource before it's accessed, potentially exposing sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** An attacker can potentially gain access to up to 24 bytes of data from the `/ifs` kernel stack.
*   **Limited Impact:** The impact is described as information disclosure of a limited amount of data (24 bytes) and is not described as leading to other impacts like code execution or privilege escalation.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Local Access:** The attack must originate from a local user.
*   **Authentication Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the system.
*   **Specific Privileges:** The user must have either `ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_CONSOLE` or `ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH` privileges.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must have a local user account with either `ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_CONSOLE` or `ISI_PRIV_LOGIN_SSH` privileges.
*   The attacker must be able to log in to the system through console or SSH.
*   The system must be running an affected version of OneFS (8.2.x - 9.1.0.x).

**Summary**
The vulnerability is due to using an uninitialized resource, leading to potential disclosure of 24 bytes of kernel stack data. It requires local access with specific privileges, and while the vulnerability exists, the impact is limited to information disclosure.
