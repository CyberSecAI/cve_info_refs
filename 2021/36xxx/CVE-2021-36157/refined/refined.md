Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36157:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

   - The content from `github.com_182fef97_20250115_225343.html` directly mentions `CVE-2021-36157` and describes how it prevents path traversal attacks, thus, it is related to this CVE
  - The content from `github.com_17aba11f_20250115_225354.html`  mentions the CVE, and that the fix prevents path traversal attacks.  It provides additional details on the vulnerability. This also relates to the CVE.
  - The content from `github.com_88fbedee_20250115_225348.html`  is a GitHub Security Advisory page for `CVE-2021-36157` which also directly relates to the CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The root cause is a lack of sanitization of the `X-Scope-OrgID` header value. This header is used to construct file paths within the application.
   -  The application does not properly validate or sanitize the `X-Scope-OrgID` header, allowing path traversal characters (e.g., `..`, `/`, `\`) to be injected.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Path Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to traverse the file system and potentially access sensitive files outside the intended scope.
   - **Improper Input Validation:** The lack of proper input validation on the `X-Scope-OrgID` header makes the application susceptible to this type of attack.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Information Disclosure:** An attacker could potentially read the content of arbitrary files that the Cortex application has access to by crafting a malicious header value. This is the main impact of the vulnerability as described in the various content snippets
   - **Other API impacts:** While less severe, an attacker could also manipulate the ingester into writing metrics to a different location, causing a "nuisance" impact.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **HTTP Header Manipulation:** The primary attack vector is through the manipulation of the `X-Scope-OrgID` HTTP header. An attacker can send a malicious header value to the server.
   - **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to send HTTP requests to the affected service with a malicious header.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    - **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Cortex instance.
    - **Control over HTTP Headers:** The attacker must be able to control or manipulate the `X-Scope-OrgID` header in the HTTP request
    - The vulnerability is present when Cortex is not behind a proxy that sanitizes the header

**Additional Technical Details (from the content):**
  - The fix includes a function `containsUnsafePathSegments` that checks for directory references like `.` and `..`, as well as path separators `/` and `\`.
  - The fix also applies to multi-tenant contexts, where multiple tenant IDs may be present in the `X-Scope-OrgID` header, separated by `|`.

**Mitigation Notes (from the content):**

   - It is mentioned that if Cortex is fronted by an auth proxy which validates the tenant IDs, the vulnerability is mitigated.
   - Running Cortex with limited access to sensitive files and in a restricted environment can limit the scope of this vulnerability.

**Summary of key details:**

- The vulnerability is a path traversal issue due to unsanitized input in the `X-Scope-OrgID` header.
- It leads to potential file content disclosure, and possibly other impacts such as writing to incorrect metric locations.
- The fix involves sanitizing the header value to remove path traversal characters and references.
- The vulnerability is rated as moderate severity.
