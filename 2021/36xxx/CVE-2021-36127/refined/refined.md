Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36127:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**

The content from `phabricator.wikimedia.org` directly references CVE-2021-36127 in the task title: "Special:GlobalUserRights reveals existence of globally suppressed users (CVE-2021-36127)". This confirms that the provided content is related to the specified CVE.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is that the `Special:GlobalUserRights` page in MediaWiki did not properly handle globally suppressed user accounts. Instead of treating these accounts as non-existent, the page displayed information about them, revealing their existence despite their suppressed status.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Information Leakage:** The primary vulnerability is the information leak. The `Special:GlobalUserRights` page revealed the existence of globally suppressed users, which should have been hidden. This could allow an attacker to enumerate these users and potentially target them in other ways.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Privacy Violation:** The exploitation of this vulnerability results in the privacy violation of globally suppressed users. By knowing the usernames of suppressed users, an attacker might try to find their alternative profiles or try to obtain other information.
-   **Enumeration of Hidden Users:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to enumerate globally suppressed user accounts.
-   **Potential for Further Attacks:** Knowing the existence of specific suppressed user accounts could enable targeted attacks. This information, combined with other leaked information from other vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-30156 and CVE-2021-30153) could allow a more targeted and complex attack

**5. Attack Vectors:**

-   **Direct Access:** An unauthenticated attacker could directly access the `Special:GlobalUserRights` page, either by a username or user ID, to determine if an account exists and if it is suppressed.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker does not need to be logged in to access the vulnerable page.
-   **Basic Knowledge:**  The attacker needs basic knowledge of MediaWiki features and URLs to access the page.

**Additional Technical Details:**

The provided Phabricator task details how the vulnerability was addressed through code changes in the `CentralAuth` extension. The patch aimed to treat suppressed users as if they do not exist in the context of `Special:GlobalUserRights`.
The fixes were deployed in multiple MediaWiki versions, as described in the Phabricator task.

**Summary of Patches**

The following patches were created and deployed to address the vulnerability:
*   `F34515858`: Initial patch to address the vulnerability.
*   `F34520123`: Second patchset, includes users with $mHidden set to 'lists'
*   `F34524186`: Fixes user id scenario described in T260863.
*  `F34532053`: Final patch, fixes issue on testwiki with `CentralAuthGroupMembershipProxy`

The patches primarily focus on modifying the CentralAuth extension to ensure that globally suppressed users are treated as non-existent when their information is requested, fixing the leakage vulnerability.

In summary, CVE-2021-36127 is an information disclosure vulnerability where `Special:GlobalUserRights` page revealed the existence of globally suppressed user accounts. The fix involved modifying the `CentralAuth` extension to ensure that suppressed users are not visible on this page.
