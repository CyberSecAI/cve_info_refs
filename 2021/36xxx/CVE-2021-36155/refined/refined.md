Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36155:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies within the `LengthPrefixedMessageReader` component of gRPC Swift. This component is responsible for parsing length-prefixed messages. The vulnerability stems from a failure to properly handle the message length.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Uncontrolled Resource Consumption:** The `LengthPrefixedMessageReader` fails to properly validate or limit the size of messages being parsed. This leads to excessive memory allocation when parsing a message with an invalidly large length prefix.
- **CWE-190 (Integer Overflow):**  The parsing process might be vulnerable to integer overflow when handling the message length.
- **CWE-400 (Uncontrolled Resource Consumption):** The vulnerability directly leads to uncontrolled resource consumption (memory allocation) which can cause a denial-of-service (DoS).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** By sending specially crafted messages with excessively large length prefixes, an attacker can cause the gRPC Swift client or server to allocate large amounts of memory, potentially leading to a denial-of-service condition. This would make the affected service unavailable to legitimate users.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Network-Based:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely by sending crafted gRPC messages over the network.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send gRPC messages to a vulnerable gRPC Swift client or server. This would mean the attacker needs to be able to connect and communicate with the affected gRPC service.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability affects gRPC Swift versions 1.0.0, 1.1.0, and 1.1.1.
- The fix is available in version 1.2.0.
- No workarounds are available, users must upgrade to the patched version to mitigate the vulnerability.
