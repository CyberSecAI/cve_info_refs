### üßê What makes Tripetto a better form builder plugin?

üí° With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create stunning custom form experiences instead of boring forms. You can use all your forms in three form layouts, also named ‚Äòform faces‚Äô in Tripetto:

* **Autoscroll form face**: the autoscroll form face presents one question at a time and is akin to Typeform‚Äôs conversational forms;
* **Chat form face**: the chat form face presents all questions and answers as speech bubbles and is partly inspired by Landbot;
* **Classic form face**: the classic form face presents question fields in a traditional form as often seen in SurveyMonkey and the likes.

Just use the form face that suits your form and purpose best. [See all form layouts.](https://tripetto.com/form-layouts/ "More info about form faces")

üí° With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create smart forms that react to the given answers of your respondents. That‚Äôs why we call them conversational forms. To help you with this, our unique visual form builder easily lets you create the right logic, like **branch logic**, **jump logic** and **pipe logic**. [Learn more about form logic.](https://tripetto.com/logic-types/ "More info about logic")

üí° With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create interactive quizzes, order forms, exams and more with the **calculator block**. Use the given answers of your respondents to perform any calculation you need in your form. The calculator block can add, subtract, multiply and divide, but also supports formulas and advanced mathematical functions. The result: fully no-code calculator forms! [Learn more about calculations.](https://tripetto.com/calculator/ "More info about the calculator block")

üí° With the Tripetto form builder plugin you create beautiful responsive forms that match your website perfectly, with custom **welcome and end screens**, advanced **styling options** and **full translations**. Your forms are **totally responsive** for mobile, tablet, laptop and desktop usage. [Learn more about customizations.](https://tripetto.com/form-layouts/ "More info about customizations")

üí° With the Tripetto form builder plugin you easily automate your form data workflows. **Receive notifications**, **connect to 1.000+ services** and **track form activity**. [Learn more about automations.](https://tripetto.com/data-automations/ "More info about automations")

After 25 years of doing IT I thought that I had seen it all but Tripetto has blown me away! Prompt support, attention to detail, flawless code. When there are so many bad plugins out there Tripetto is one of the few professional application/plugins that are affordable. I could not have done my current project without Tripetto.

We have been using Tripetto Pro for about 2 years now and it‚Äôs one of our favorite plugins. The chat form is so much better than any other form we tried at driving customer engagement and actually encouraging users to provide their information. On top of that it‚Äôs so versatile and powerful so that we can learn a lot about the user based on what device they use, what page they come from etc.
On top of being a solid plugin the support from them was above and beyond when we had some issues with our site. They spent the time to actually login and look around to figure out what settings and other plugins were interacting in a bad way and let us know how to fix it. Def worth every penny!

It is simple to use and looks nice. I would like to see the added ability to format the introduction and closing text alignment; Right, Left, Justify. Once that is done, this will be to best form creator in the land!!

Ich habe fast alle Formbuilder ausprobiert, sei es formidable, wpforms, fluentforms, ninjaforms und und und‚Ä¶st√§ndig hat irgendwas nicht funktioniert, man brauchte eigenes css oder sonstiges. Ich bin kein Programmierer und kann auch nicht verstehen, wie man so wenig intuitive Tools entwickelt teilweise, allen voran Formidable, sicherlich sehr m√§chtig aber ohne Programmierkenntnisse einfach nervig. Tripetto ist einfach unschlagbar. Sehr schade, dass es verh√§ltnism√§√üig unbekannt ist. Ich w√ºnschte ich h√§tte es schon vor einigen Jahren gefunden.

How can Patchstack provide the fastest protection?

Patchstack is one of the largest open-source vulnerability disclosers in the world. For example, in 2023 more than 70% of new WordPress vulnerabilities were originally published by Patchstack. This focus on research enables us to deploy vulnerability protection rules faster than anybody else.

What is virtual patching?

Patchstack vPatching auto-mitigates security vulnerabilities even when there's no official patch available. It's the fastest and most effective way to eliminate new security vulnerabilities without sacrificing performance.

Why would a hacker target my website?

Hackers automate attacks against new security vulnerabilities to take over as many websites as they can before users have time to patch and update. The attacks are opportunistic and victims are not chosen - everyone is a target.

What if my website has already been compromised?

We recommend reaching out to your hosting provider for server-side malware scanning or use a professional incident response service. Don't rely on plugin based malware scanners as they are commonly tampered with by malware.
