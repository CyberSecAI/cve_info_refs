Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-36748:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The vulnerability lies in the `ph_simpleblog` Prestashop module, specifically within the `SimpleBlogCategory::getByRewrite()` function.
- User-supplied input from the `sb_category` parameter is not sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **SQL Injection (SQLi):** The lack of sanitization allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the `link_rewrite` parameter of the query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- An attacker could potentially gain unauthorized access to the database.
- Depending on the database permissions and the attacker's actions, the impact could range from reading sensitive information to modifying or deleting data.

**Attack Vectors:**

- The vulnerability is accessible through the `sb_category` parameter in the `list` controller of the module.
- The specific URL endpoint is `/module/ph_simpleblog/list?sb_category=*` where `*` is the malicious SQL payload.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Prestashop instance.
- No authentication is required for exploiting the vulnerability, since it is present in a front-facing controller.
- The attacker does not need to be an administrator or have any special privileges.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is a boolean-based blind SQL injection.
- The vendor patched this vulnerability in version 1.7.8 of the module.
- The vulnerability was discovered during a penetration test.
- The vulnerability can be detected using SQLmap.
