# SQLi in ph\_simpleblog CVE-2021-36748

This blog post details an SQLi I found in Blog for Prestashop (ph\_simpleblog) by [Prestahome](https://prestahome.com/), it is also my first CVE 😊

To begin with I had to identify that the module was installed, it is a blog plugin so this can generally be spotted by looking at the page source of the blog but you can also test if Prestashop modules are installed more directly by checking `https://example.com/modules/ph_simpleblog/config.xml`.

This Prestashop module uses the controller functionality so that’s where I started to look as it’s usually where the user input will go first.

The controllers of interest were `controllers/front/list.php` and `controllers/front/single.php`. In Prestashop modules the init() and initContent() functions are called whenever the endpoint is reached.
In the init function we can see that the `sb_category` parameter isn’t sanitised.
```
public function init(){
	parent::init();
	$sb_category = Tools::getValue('sb_category');
	// ...
	if($sb_category) $this->sb_category = $sb_category;
	//more code...
}
```

Later in the initContent() function sb\_category gets passed to the getByRewrite() function in the SimpleBlogCategory class.
```
public function initContent(){
	// ...
	if($this->sb_category != ''){
		$this->context->smarty->assign('is_category', true);
		$SimpleBlogCategory =
		SimpleBlogCategory::getByRewrite($this->sb_category, $id_lang);
```

In the getByRewrite function we can see it gets used in an SQL query without any sanitisation.
```
public static function getByRewrite($rewrite = null, $id_lang = false){
	if(!$rewrite) return;
	$sql = new DbQuery();
	$sql->select('l.id_simpleblog_category');
	$sql->from('simpleblog_category_lang', 'l');
	if($id_lang)
		$sql->where('l.link_rewrite = \''.$rewrite.'\' AND l.id_lang =
	'.(int)$id_lang);
	else
		$sql->where('l.link_rewrite = \''.$rewrite.'\'');
	$category = new SimpleBlogCategory(Db::getInstance()->getValue($sql),
	$id_lang);
	return $category;
}
```

Okay, success, found the SQLi but where is this endpoint?
In Prestashop the controllers for modules are located at `/module/modulename/filename` (not `/modules`!) so for this case: `https://example.com/module/ph_simpleblog/list?sb_category=*`.
No exploit script or manual SQLi was required as sqlmap was able to detect it as boolean-based blind.

# Fixing the issue

Prestashop provide a built in function for sanitising strings to be used in SQL queries called pSQL. This is the quick fix in situations like this but one must be sure to surround the parameter with quotes or the query will still be vulnerable to SQLi as I will show in the next blog post.

The most correct way to patch this would be to use PDO as desribed in Prestashop’s [Best Practices for the DB Class](https://doc.prestashop.com/pages/viewpage.action?pageId=51184692). PDO eliminates the risks of faulty parameter sanitisation and makes it hard to do things the wrong way.

I found the contact details for the developer of the module and they were quickly able to patch the issue.

```

Add the following to your `config.toml` or `config.yaml`

```
theme =  ["github.com/Mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis"]
```

### As Git Submodule

Inside the folder of your Hugo site run:

```
$ git submodule add https://github.com/mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis.git themes/anubis

```

For more information read the official [setup guide](https://gohugo.io/overview/installing/) of Hugo.

### Check your site

In order to see your site in action, run Hugo's built-in local server.

`$ hugo server`

Now enter [`localhost:1313`](http://localhost:1313/) in the address bar of your browser.

## Feature Settings

### Dark Mode

Customize via `style` param in `params` section of config.
Options:

* `light-without-switcher` - light theme, without switcher (by default)
* `dark-without-switcher` - dark theme, without switcher
* `auto-without-switcher` - theme based on user system settings, without switcher
* `light` - light theme by default, can be switched by user to dark theme and back. Theme settings are saved for user
* `dark` - dark theme by default, can be switched by user to light theme and back. Theme settings are saved for user
* `auto` - theme based on user system settings by default, can be switched by user to dark/light theme. Theme settings are saved for user (by default in example sites)

### Table of Contents

If `toc` param in `params` section of the config file is set to `true`,
Table of Contents is generated for every post that is at least `tocWordCount`
words long (`0` by default, also belongs to the `params` section of the config).

This behavior can be overridden on per-post basis
by setting `toc` to either `true` or `false` in the front matter of a post.

### Social icons

#### Predefined icons

To add icon from predefined list, add to `params.social` config:

* id of social network
* name for placeholder (usually it's your nickname or login)

Predefined list:

* email
* facebook
* github
* instagram
* linkedin
* mastodon (need full url)
* patreon
* reddit
* snapchat
* soundcloud
* spotify
* telegram
* twitch
* twitter
* vk
* youtube

Example:

```
  - id: github
    name: gohugoio

```

Config like this generate github icon with "<https://github.com/gohugoio>" url.

#### Predefined icons with custom url

To add predefined icon with custom url, add to `params.social` config:

* id of social network
* full url to your network

Example:

```
  - id: github
    url: "https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo"

```

Config like this generate github icon with "<https://github.com/gohugoio/hugo>" url.

#### Custom icons

To add custom icon, add to `params.social` config:

* id of social network/site
* full url to your network/site

Also you need to create directory `static/fa-icons` and add svg icon of your network/site with name equals to `id` from config.

Example:

```
  - id: google
    url: "https://www.google.com/search?q=I'm+lucky"

```

Icon should be "static/fa-icons/google.svg"

If you want font awesome icons, download "Font Awesome For Desktop" and open svg directory.

### Google Analytics

Only works for production environment.

### Multilingual mode

Check config/example usage in [exampleSiteMultilingual](https://github.com/Mitrichius/hugo-theme-anubis/tree/master/exampleSiteMultilingual) directory and documentation on [Hugo site](https://gohugo.io/content-management/multilingual/).

### RSS

RSS is available by site url + /index.xml. Also available for specific language, section, taxonomy.

`rssAsSocialIcon` parameter enables rss social icon with link to site current language RSS.

### Robots.txt

Based on environment.

For production — allow all, for other — disallow all.

### Favorite posts

Add `favorite: true` to post front matter. It adds a "★" icon nearby post's title.

### Related posts (Read Next section)

### Hiding posts from RSS

### Make post available only by link

### Pagination on post single page

### Webmentions

To provide webmention support you can **either** specify your webmention.io username with `login: webmentionusername` **or** specify a link to your custom webmention endpoint with `url: https://yourdomain.com/webemntions/receive`.
If you use webmention.io you can also enable pingback with `pingback: true`

### Disabling comments per-page basis

Add `disableComments: true` to post front matter.

## Custom shortcodes

### Video (for local videofiles)

![Hugo Logo](/images/hugo-logo-wide.svg)
## The world’s fastest framework for building websites

Hugo is one of the most popular open-source static site generators. With its amazing speed and flexibility, Hugo makes building websites fun again.

[Quick Start](/getting-started/quick-start/)

![icon depicting Blistering Speed](/images/icon-fast.svg)

### Blistering Speed

What's modern about waiting for your site to build?

Hugo is the fastest tool of its kind. At <1 ms per page, the average site builds in less than a second.

![icon depicting Robust Content Management](/images/icon-content-management.svg)

### Robust Content Management

Flexibility rules. Hugo is a content strategist's dream.

Hugo supports unlimited content types, taxonomies, menus, dynamic API-driven content, and more, all without plugins.

![icon depicting Shortcodes](/images/icon-shortcodes.svg)

### Shortcodes

Hugo's shortcodes are Markdown's hidden superpower.

We love the beautiful simplicity of Markdown’s syntax, but there are times when we want more flexibility. Hugo shortcodes allow for both beauty and flexibility.

![icon depicting Built-in Templates](/images/icon-built-in-templates.svg)

### Built-in Templates

Hugo has common patterns to get your work done quickly.

Hugo ships with pre-made templates to make quick work of SEO, commenting, analytics and other functions. One line of code, and you're done.

![icon depicting Multilingual and i18n](/images/icon-multilingual2.svg)

### Multilingual and i18n

Polyglot baked in.

Hugo provides full i18n support for multi-language sites with the same straightforward development experience Hugo users love in single-language sites.

![icon depicting Custom Outputs](/images/icon-custom-outputs.svg)

### Custom Outputs

HTML not enough?

Hugo allows you to output your content in multiple formats, including JSON or AMP, and makes it easy to create your own.

### 300+ Themes

Hugo provides a robust theming system that is easy to implement but capable of producing even the most complicated websites.

[Check out the Hugo themes.](https://themes.gohugo.io/)

![image depicting an example of Capable Templating](/images/home-page-templating-example.png)

### Capable Templating

Hugo's Go-based templating provides just the right amount of logic to build anything from the simple to complex.

[Get Started.](https://gohugo.io/templates/)

### Template / PR Information

Blog for PrestaShop by PrestaHome up until version 1.7.7 is vulnerable to SQL injections.

Vulnerable path: /module/ph\_simpleblog/list?sb\_category=

It doesn't seem like data can be reflected with a `UNION SELECT` and due to a special way the plugin or shop system seems to react to an empty result caused by a `AND false` injection in the `WHERE` clause, I figured this might be faster than a time-based detection.

From by observation while creating the template with example pages, requesting the normal site by showing all categories via `OR true-- -` returns a 200 with some content or an information that there are no posts and not returning any data by using `AND false` results in an entirely empty 404 response. Combining all these aspects into the need of an 200 vs. a 404 and a existent body vs. an empty body should be a solid detection. We could go time-based though. It takes 4 times the `SLEEP` value, so 5 takes about 20 seconds, 3 takes about 12 seconds.

If I may ask a question while someone with more in-depth knowledge about Nuclei is reading this:

Is there a way to dump DSL aspects? Like if my DSL doesn't match for some reason, it would be nice to have some kind of a debug mode that tells me about `status_code_1`, `status_code_2` and the other values. In the best case it even detects the parts that don't match. Maybe not just for DSL matchers but for any matcher so I know what exactly has been done and returned to debug why things don't work, -v only gives the request path. This is also how I found out why I seemingly need to use raw requests for this simple task. There was a double `//` if the input target has a trailing `/`, which caused the application to respond differently, it seems to be important to have the exact path and using trimright doesn't work in normal requests to remove a possible trailing slash if I'm not mistaken. (Just as documentation and information for people that might read this in the future: This is BS. I was using an older Nuclei version, the behaviour was changed over time.)

Please feel free to correct me if I am wrong about any of my information, I'm also open to a time-based detection as explained above.

### Template Validation

I've validated this template locally?

* YES
* NO

#### Additional Details (leave it blank if not applicable)

You can easily find vulnerable pages by searching for "modules/ph\_simpleblog/" in website source code search engines. Basically all of them are vulnerable. I literally can't find a secure one which is bad for a double verification. Even the demo shop from the vendor is still vulnerable.

| [@pajoda](https://github.com/pajoda)  If I may ask a question while someone with more in-depth knowledge about Nuclei is reading this: Is there a way to dump DSL aspects? Like if my DSL doesn't match for some reason, it would be nice to have some kind of a debug mode that tells me about status\_code\_1, status\_code\_2 and the other values. In the best case it even detects the parts that don't match. Maybe not just for DSL matchers but for any matcher so I know what exactly has been done and returned to debug why things don't work, -v only gives the request path.  You can use `debug` flag to dump request and response, or `debug-req` or `debug-resp` for dumping specific parts. |

[@pajoda](https://github.com/pajoda) thank you for adding all the details around this template, it's working very well, also the matchers you wrote were technically right, I just updated them per line to make it more readable and easy to understand for others.

Also only looking for length and status code will work for the vulnerable host, as well as some random hosts having similar responses, so it's always a good idea to include some page-specific unique string to ensure our matchers doesn't get a match against an unrelated target, so I've also included PrestaShop specific string in the matchers.

I've also noticed that `len(body_2) == 0` works perfectly when a server returns the `content-length` header in the response, and unfortunately not all the servers return that header, in that case, this matcher will miss the valid target, so I think this part can be improved as well.

Sorry, something went wrong.

| No problem, I hope detailed information helps to speed up your review and understand my thought process and find possible issues in it.  Great addition again, I should have spotted the redirect header too actually. Thank you!  I see, comprehensive review again! Does the following matcher section fix this?  ```           - "status_code_1 == 200"           - 'contains(tolower(body_1), "prestashop")'           - "len(body_1) > 0"           - "status_code_2 == 404"           - 'trimspace(body_2) == ""'           - "contains(tolower(all_headers_2), 'index.php?controller=404')" ```  I also added a `tolower` to the `prestashop` string lookup. I guess you were looking for `var prestashop` which seems to be a very common thing, I saw some CSS classes on several pages that were Pascal Case, additionally a `PrestaShop` generator meta tag seems to be a thing so I figured this might make it a bit more flexible. |
