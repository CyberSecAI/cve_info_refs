Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-36775:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from an incomplete authorization logic check within Rancher. When a Project Role associated with a group is removed from a project, the corresponding RoleBindings that grant access to cluster-scoped resources for users within that group are not deleted.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Incomplete Authorization Logic:** The core issue lies in the failure to properly remove RoleBindings when project roles associated with groups are deleted. This indicates a flaw in the authorization mechanism.
*   **Orphaned RoleBindings:** The vulnerability results in the existence of orphaned RoleBindings, which continue to grant access even after the associated project role has been removed.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Access:** Users who are members of an affected group, despite having a project role removed, can retain access to cluster-scoped resources they should no longer have access to. This could lead to:
    *   **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized access to sensitive data.
    *   **Integrity Breach:** Unauthorized modification of data or resources.
    *   **Availability Impact:**  Potential disruption of service due to unauthorized actions.
*   **Severity:** The vulnerability is classified as "High" severity.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Exploitation can occur over a network.
*   **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability is essentially a form of authorization bypass, as users maintain access despite a change in their permissions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Rancher User:** An attacker needs to be a user with authenticated access to Rancher.
*   **Group Membership:** The attacker needs to be a member of a group that had a Project Role in a given project, that is now removed.
*   **Low Privileges Required:** The attacker only needs low-level privileges, to have been a member of a group that had a project role in a given project in the first place.
*   **User Interaction Required**: There is some user interaction required. The attacker has to have been, at some point, a member of a group with an associated project role.

**Additional Notes:**
*   The vulnerability affects Rancher versions up to and including 2.4.17, 2.5.11 and 2.6.2.
*   Patched versions include 2.4.18, 2.5.12, 2.6.3, and later.
*   A GitHub security advisory ([https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-28g7-896h-695v](https://github.com/rancher/rancher/security/advisories/GHSA-28g7-896h-695v)) details this vulnerability and its fix.
*  The CVSS:3.1 score is AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H.
