+ nvlist\_conditional by="product" stock="true|false|{number}|{min-max}"
+ nvweb conditional by="product" stock="true|false|{number}|{min-max}"
\* use query parameters when making a quick search in lists (prevents SQL injection attacks)
\* layout.class: purify url request parameter "fid"
\* purify "navigate-quicksearch" url request parameter to prevent reflected XSS attacks
- session: remove deprecated code supporting PHP versions before 7.3
\* always use https url in application, if available

\* minor changes to improve code readability

\* webusers: show email column in list
\* items: additional checks to prevent Flot errors
+ nvweb list: categories attribute now allows passing the name of a property
+ nvweb list: requesting webuser "fullname" allows looking for the username
+ nvweb list: allow special list sources from themes and extensions
+ comments.class: added function "author\_fullname" which looks for the full name of the user if he's the author of the comment
+ nvweb: nv conditionals can now be delayed like nv lists
- remove pixlr integration
+ nvweb list conditional: added "not" attribute to help negate any conditional
\* interface: improve control in navigate cms actions menu
\* orders: mute PHP errors when generating a PDF
\* REF r(): custom script version for navigate cms

### **[hydrasky-team](/hydrasky-team)** commented [Jun 22, 2021](#issue-927001399)

| **EXPECTED BEHAVIOUR** An authenticated malicious user can take advantage of a Reflected XSS vulnerability with navigate-quickse parameter in URL and affect many modules.  **IMPACT** Commonly include transmitting private data, like cookies or other session information, to the attacker, redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker, or performing other malicious operations on the user’s machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.  **VULNERABILITY CODE** I found the vulnerability code in many files. Because **initial\_url** is built in these files.  lib\packages\backups\backups.php lib\packages\blocks\blocks.php lib\packages\brands\brands.php lib\packages\comments\comments.php lib\packages\coupons\coupons.php lib\packages\feeds\feeds.php lib\packages\functions\functions.php lib\packages\items\items.php lib\packages\menus\menus.php lib\packages\orders\orders.php lib\packages\payment\_methods\payment\_methods.php lib\packages\products\products.php lib\packages\profiles\profiles.php lib\packages\shipping\_methods\shipping\_methods.php lib\packages\templates\templates.php lib\packages\users\users.php lib\packages\webdictionary\webdictionary.php lib\packages\websites\websites.php lib\packages\webusers\webusers.php  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64893387/122894984-e7e14f00-d371-11eb-9450-192ada36e8bd.png)  After that **initial\_url** is used in **\lib\layout\navitable.class.php** file to build HTML.  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64893387/122895219-1c550b00-d372-11eb-8fa4-7ef5bc98af60.png)  **STEPS TO REPRODUCE**   1. We change the request and send the link to user   `GET /navigate-2.9.3r1525/navigate/navigate.php?fid=websites&act=list&quicksearch=true&navigate-quicksearch=0"})%3b+alert("XSS")%3b$("%23websites_list").jqGrid({//`  [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/64893387/122895634-8077cf00-d372-11eb-9089-a23e5cbfd738.png)   2. People who already login and click to the link above. 3. When loading the page then the Reflected XSS is executed.
