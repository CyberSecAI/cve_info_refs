The provided content relates to CVE-2021-36454.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by the lack of sanitization of the `navigate-quicksearch` parameter in the URL. This parameter is used to build the `initial_url` variable, which is then used to construct HTML content without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The `navigate-quicksearch` URL parameter is not sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code that is executed in the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Transmitting private data, like cookies or other session information, to the attacker.
- Redirecting the victim to web content controlled by the attacker.
- Performing other malicious operations on the userâ€™s machine under the guise of the vulnerable site.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attacker crafts a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `navigate-quicksearch` parameter.
- The attacker sends this crafted URL to an authenticated user.
- When the user clicks the malicious link, the XSS payload is executed in the user's browser.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
- The attacker needs to be able to send or trick an authenticated user into clicking the malicious URL.
