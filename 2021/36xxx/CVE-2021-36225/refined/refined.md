Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-36225:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is the combination of a hard-coded, blank password for the `nobody` user, coupled with the ability for this low-privileged user to initiate firmware updates through an authenticated REST API endpoint.
*   The lack of cryptographic verification of firmware upgrades allows attackers to upload and install malicious firmware.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Hard-coded Credentials (CVE-2021-36224):** The `nobody` user has a hard-coded empty password, allowing access to authenticated REST API endpoints.
*   **Insecure Firmware Update Initiation (CVE-2021-36225):** A low-privileged user (`nobody`) can initiate firmware updates via the REST API endpoint `/api/2.1/rest/firmware_update`. This endpoint should require administrative privileges.
*   **Lack of Firmware Verification (CVE-2021-36226):** The device does not cryptographically verify the authenticity of firmware updates, relying only on integrity checks like checksums and magic number verification.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can gain root-level code execution by uploading and flashing a malicious firmware.
*   **Persistent Backdoor:** The attacker can create a persistent backdoor that grants full control of the device even after a reboot. This can be achieved by replacing legitimate system binaries (like `upnp_nas_device`) with malicious code that spawns a reverse shell.
*   **Full Device Control:** Once the backdoor is installed, the attacker can fully control the device, including access to stored data.

**4. Attack Vectors:**

*   **Remote Network Access:** The vulnerability is exploitable by anyone who has network access to the device. This includes devices exposed to the internet or devices on the local network if remote access is enabled.
*   **REST API Abuse:** The attack exploits the REST API using a low-privileged account.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Connectivity:** The attacker needs network connectivity to the target device.
*   **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the specific REST API endpoint (`/api/2.1/rest/firmware_update`) to initiate the firmware update.
*   **Malicious Firmware Creation:** The attacker needs to create a malicious firmware image that passes the device's integrity checks but contains the backdoor. Tools provided in the GPL code for the device can be used for this purpose.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was discovered by Pedro Ribeiro and Radek Domanski, who planned to present it at Pwn2Own Tokyo 2020.
*   Western Digital released OS5 shortly before Pwn2Own, which fixed these vulnerabilities but also introduced other issues that angered users and made some features unavailable.
*   The researchers provided a temporary patch that users can apply at each reboot but does not survive a reboot.
*   The exploit chain relies on using the `nobody` account and the ability to upload arbitrary files via the vulnerable REST endpoint.
