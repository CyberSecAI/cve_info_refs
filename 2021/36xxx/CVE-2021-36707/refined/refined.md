Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-36707:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `set_ledonoff` function in the `adm.cgi` binary directly passes the value of the `led_cmd` parameter to the `do_system` function, which is essentially a wrapper around the `system` call. This allows for arbitrary command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The primary vulnerability is the injection of arbitrary commands due to the insecure handling of the `led_cmd` parameter.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Remote Code Execution: An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the router with root privileges. This can lead to complete control over the device.
- Reverse Shell: By injecting commands to download and execute a malicious payload, an attacker can establish a reverse shell connection, gaining interactive access to the router.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP POST requests: The vulnerability is triggered by sending an HTTP POST request to the `/cgi-bin/adm.cgi` endpoint.
- `page` parameter: The POST request must include the `page` parameter with the value `ledonoff` to reach the vulnerable function.
- `led_cmd` parameter: The malicious commands are injected via the `led_cmd` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Authentication: The attacker needs to be authenticated on the router's admin panel to reach the vulnerable function.
- Network Access: The attacker needs to have network connectivity to the router to send the malicious requests.
