This document describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router and gateway models. This advisory is identified by PSV-2018-0244 and does not have an associated CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue, meaning that malicious scripts can be injected into the device's storage and executed when a user interacts with the affected functionality. The document doesn't provide the technical details of the vulnerable code, other than that it is a stored XSS.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access the administration interface of the vulnerable device. This can lead to various malicious activities, such as session hijacking, defacement, redirection to malicious sites, or potentially even more severe actions depending on the userâ€™s privileges.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves injecting malicious scripts into a field of the router/gateway configuration, where the script will be stored. When a user visits a page displaying this data, the script will be executed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have the ability to inject the malicious script into the configuration of the NETGEAR device. This would require either the ability to access the administration panel with a high level of permissions, or a previous successful exploitation of other vulnerabilities or use of default credentials to gain such access. The document indicates a CVSS v3 vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L which translates to:
- Attack Vector (AV): Adjacent. The attacker needs to be on the same network segment.
- Attack Complexity (AC): Low. No special conditions are required to exploit the vulnerability.
- Privileges Required (PR): High. The attacker needs to have administrative access.
- User Interaction (UI): Required. The victim user must interact with the malicious data
- Scope (S): Unchanged. Exploiting the vulnerability does not change the authority granted to the attacker.
- Confidentiality Impact (C): Low. Some sensitive information may be disclosed.
- Integrity Impact (I): Low. The attacker may be able to modify some data.
- Availability Impact (A): Low. The attacker may cause minor disruptions.

**Additional Information:**
*   The document provides a list of affected NETGEAR product models and the minimum firmware version that fixes the vulnerability for each.
*   The vulnerability was reported by "aircut".
*   The document includes a CVSS v3 score of 4.1 (Medium).
