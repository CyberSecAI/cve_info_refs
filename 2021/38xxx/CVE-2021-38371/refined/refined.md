Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38371:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in how Exim handles responses during a STARTTLS handshake when acting as a mail client (sending emails). Specifically, when initiating a STARTTLS connection, a MitM attacker can inject a response to the *next* command, and Exim incorrectly processes it as a valid response.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Response Injection:** Exim is susceptible to response injection, where a malicious actor can inject server responses and have the client interpret them as legitimate responses as part of the encrypted connection.
*   **Improper Handling of Responses:** Exim does not properly validate or segregate the responses received after the STARTTLS handshake, leading to the vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker with a MitM position can exploit this vulnerability to potentially manipulate the communication between Exim and the receiving mail server.
*   **Undermining STARTTLS:** The vulnerability undermines the security provided by STARTTLS by allowing an attacker to inject commands as if they were part of the encrypted connection.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Meddler-in-the-Middle (MitM):** The primary attack vector requires the attacker to be in a MitM position, intercepting the traffic between the sending Exim server and the receiving mail server.
*   **Malicious Server Response:** The attacker crafts a malicious response that is sent after the STARTTLS command, but before the TLS handshake is fully established, that Exim treats as a trusted response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Interception:** The attacker must be able to intercept and modify network traffic between the Exim server and the receiving mail server.
*   **Timing:** The attacker needs to send the malicious response to the next command at the correct moment in the handshake process to be effective.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The Exim developers do not consider this a security problem.
*   There are no reports of successful attacks using this method.
*   The provided content from nostarttls.secvuln.info offers further context for the vulnerability by placing it among a larger family of STARTTLS issues.
*   The research paper cited on the site provides extensive technical background on the issue

The vulnerability is fixed in version 4.95 and later.
