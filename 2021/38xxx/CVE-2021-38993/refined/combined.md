To return expected results, you can:

* **Reduce the number of search terms.** Each term you use focuses the search further.
* **Check your spelling.** A single misspelled or incorrectly typed term can change your result.
* **Try substituting synonyms for your original terms.** For example, instead of searching for "java classes", try "java training"

# Security Bulletin: Vulnerability in the AIX smbcd daemon (CVE-2021-38993)

### Security Bulletin

## Summary

There is a vulnerability in the AIX smbcd daemon.

## Vulnerability Details

 **CVEID:** [CVE-2021-38993](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38993)

## Affected Products and Versions

| Affected Product(s) | Version(s) |
| --- | --- |
| AIX | 7.1 |
| AIX | 7.2 |
| AIX | 7.3 |
| VIOS | 3.1 |

The following fileset levels are vulnerable:

| Fileset | Lower Level | Upper Level |
| --- | --- | --- |
| smbc.rte | 7.1.0.0 | 7.1.302.6 |
| smbc.rte | 7.2.0.0 | 7.2.302.6 |

To determine if your system is vulnerable, execute the following commands:

        lslpp -L | grep -i smbc.rte

## Remediation/Fixes

**A. FIXES**

The fixes can be downloaded via ftp or http from:

ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/smbcd\_fix.tar
<http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/smbcd_fix.tar>
<https://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/smbcd_fix.tar>

The latest SMB client fileset may also be downloaded from:
<https://www.ibm.com/resources/mrs/assets?source=aixbp>

To extract the fixes from the tar file:

For AIX 7.1:
tar xvf smbcd\_fix.tar
gunzip smbc\_302\_fileset\_71.tar.gz | tar xvf

For AIX 7.2, 7.3, and VIOS 3.1:
tar xvf smbcd\_fix.tar
gunzip smbc\_302\_fileset\_72.tar.gz | tar xvf

IMPORTANT: If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup of the system be created.  Verify it is both bootable and readable before proceeding.

To preview the fix installation:

installp -apYd . smbc

To install the fix package:

installp -aXYd . smbc

Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

The checksums below were generated using the "openssl dgst -sha256 [file]" command as the following:

| openssl dgst -sha256 | filename |
| --- | --- |
| 82386d9913a386c234dcef6bafa53c803d173760218cea34b94645ab18a89f1f | smbc\_302\_fileset\_71.tar.gz |
| ee3966422b87e95b3cdba9537f6276c8e48be9d89ca409fbd258c2a20230034b | smbc\_302\_fileset\_72.tar.gz |

These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be confirmed, contact IBM AIX Support at <https://ibm.com/support/> and describe the discrepancy.

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [advisory\_file].sig [advisory\_file]

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [fix\_file].sig [fix\_file]

Published advisory OpenSSL signature file location:
