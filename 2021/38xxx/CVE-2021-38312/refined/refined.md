Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38312:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an incorrect authorization check within the `redux/v1/templates/` REST API route of the "Gutenberg Template Library & Redux Framework" plugin. The `permission_callback` only checked for the `edit_posts` capability, which is granted to lower-privileged roles like contributors and authors. This allowed these users to access functionalities they shouldn't have.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The primary weakness is the lack of proper authorization checks on REST API endpoints. The plugin incorrectly relied on the `edit_posts` capability, granting access to sensitive functionalities to lower-privileged users.
*  **Arbitrary Plugin Installation:** Lower privileged users could install and activate arbitrary plugins via the `redux/v1/templates/plugin-install` endpoint. While the plugin activation is limited to plugins matching certain main file criteria, this could be used to install vulnerable plugins.
*   **Arbitrary Post Deletion:** Lower privileged users could delete any post or page using the `redux/v1/templates/delete_saved_block` endpoint.
*   **License Management Access:** Lower privileged users could access license management endpoints under the `redux/v1/templates/` route, which they shouldn't have access to.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary Plugin Installation:** Attackers could install vulnerable plugins to further exploit the site.
*   **Data Loss/Manipulation:** Attackers could delete arbitrary posts and pages, leading to data loss or manipulation.
*   **Unauthorized Access to License Management:** Lower-privileged users could access license management features, potentially leading to unauthorized changes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network:** Exploitation occurs over the network via the WordPress REST API.
*   **REST API Endpoint Access:** Attackers send requests to specific REST API endpoints: `redux/v1/templates/plugin-install` and `redux/v1/templates/delete_saved_block`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **WordPress User Account:** Attackers need a WordPress user account with at least the "contributor" role, which has the `edit_posts` capability.
*   **Network Access:** Attackers need to be able to send requests to the WordPress site's REST API.
*  **Knowledge of vulnerable API endpoints:** Attackers need to know which specific API endpoints to target and how to construct the requests

**Additional Notes:**
* The plugin's publisher responded quickly and released a patch (version 4.2.13) promptly
* Wordfence Premium users received a firewall rule to protect against the REST API vulnerability on the day of disclosure, and free users received the same protection 30 days later.
* The vulnerability was discovered by Ramuel Gall.
* The provided content also discusses another vulnerability (CVE-2021-38314) related to unauthenticated sensitive information disclosure.
