{
  "CVE-2021-38507": {
    "root_cause": "The Opportunistic Encryption feature of HTTP2 allowed a connection to be transparently upgraded to TLS while retaining the visual properties of an HTTP connection, including being same-origin with unencrypted connections on port 80. If a second encrypted port on the same IP address did not opt-in to opportunistic encryption, a network attacker could forward a connection from the browser to port 443 to the other port, causing the browser to treat the content of that port as same-origin with HTTP.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect implementation of HTTP2 Opportunistic Encryption",
       "Bypass of Same-Origin-Policy (SOP)"
    ],
    "impact": "Bypassing the Same-Origin-Policy on services hosted on other ports, potentially leading to information disclosure or other malicious activities.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network attacker manipulates DNS records to redirect traffic"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": "A network attacker is needed to control DNS records and forward connections."
