The provided content discusses multiple vulnerabilities in the Brizy Page Builder plugin, including CVE-2021-38344.

**CVE-2021-38344:**

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin did not properly sanitize user-supplied data when updating page content via the `brizy_update_item` AJAX action. Specifically, it allowed the injection of JavaScript code into the `data` parameter of the request.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS).
*   **Impact of exploitation:** A lower-privileged user can inject malicious JavaScript into a page, which will then execute when another user (such as an administrator) views the page. This can lead to site takeover by allowing the attacker to perform actions such as creating new administrative users, escalating user privileges, or adding backdoors via malicious code.
*  **Attack vectors:** A logged-in user modifies a request sent to update a page via the `brizy_update_item` AJAX action by adding JavaScript to the `data` parameter.
*  **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a logged-in user (even a subscriber) and needs to know valid `hash` and `editor-version` parameters which can be found on dashboard pages. The `dataVersion` parameter is easily guessable with a few repeated requests.
