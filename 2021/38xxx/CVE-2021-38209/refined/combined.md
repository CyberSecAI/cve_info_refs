netfilter: conntrack: Make global sysctls readonly in non-init netns

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/2671fa4dc0109d3fb581bc3078fdf17b5d9080f6)

```
These sysctls point to global variables:
- NF_SYSCTL_CT_MAX (&nf_conntrack_max)
- NF_SYSCTL_CT_EXPECT_MAX (&nf_ct_expect_max)
- NF_SYSCTL_CT_BUCKETS (&nf_conntrack_htable_size_user)

Because their data pointers are not updated to point to per-netns
structures, they must be marked read-only in a non-init_net ns.
Otherwise, changes in any net namespace are reflected in (leaked into)
all other net namespaces. This problem has existed since the
introduction of net namespaces.

The current logic marks them read-only only if the net namespace is
owned by an unprivileged user (other than init_user_ns).

Commit [d0febd8](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/d0febd81ae77a0e13717f1412ff9589e43fc4f8b) ("netfilter: conntrack: re-visit sysctls in
unprivileged namespaces") "exposes all sysctls even if the namespace is
unpriviliged." Since we need to mark them readonly in any case, we can
forego the unprivileged user check altogether.

perf/core: Fix unconditional security\_locked\_down() call
commit 08ef1af4de5fe7de9c6d69f1e22e51b66e385d9b upstream.
Currently, the lockdown state is queried unconditionally, even though
its result is used only if the PERF\_SAMPLE\_REGS\_INTR bit is set in
attr.sample\_type. While that doesn't matter in case of the Lockdown LSM,
it causes trouble with the SELinux's lockdown hook implementation.
SELinux implements the locked\_down hook with a check whether the current
task's type has the corresponding "lockdown" class permission
("integrity" or "confidentiality") allowed in the policy. This means
that calling the hook when the access control decision would be ignored
generates a bogus permission check and audit record.
Fix this by checking sample\_type first and only calling the hook when
its result would be honored.

platform/x86: thinkpad\_acpi: Correct thermal sensor allocation
commit 6759e18e5cd8745a5dfc5726e4a3db5281ec1639 upstream.
On recent Thinkpad platforms it was reported that temp sensor 11 was
always incorrectly displaying 66C. It turns out the reason for this is
that this location in EC RAM is not a temperature sensor but is the
power supply ID (offset 0xC2).
Based on feedback from the Lenovo firmware team the EC RAM version can
be determined and for the current version (3) only the 0x78 to 0x7F
range is used for temp sensors. I don't have any details for earlier
versions so I have left the implementation unaltered there.
Note - in this block only 0x78 and 0x79 are officially designated (CPU &
GPU sensors). The use of the other locations in the block will vary from
platform to platform; but the existing logic to detect a sensor presence
holds.

USB: Add reset-resume quirk for WD19's Realtek Hub
commit ca91fd8c7643d93bfc18a6fec1a0d3972a46a18a upstream.
Realtek Hub (0bda:5487) in Dell Dock WD19 sometimes fails to work
after the system resumes from suspend with remote wakeup enabled
device connected:
[ 1947.640907] hub 5-2.3:1.0: hub\_ext\_port\_status failed (err = -71)
[ 1947.641208] usb 5-2.3-port5: cannot disable (err = -71)
[ 1947.641401] hub 5-2.3:1.0: hub\_ext\_port\_status failed (err = -71)
[ 1947.641450] usb 5-2.3-port4: cannot reset (err = -71)
Information of this hub:
T: Bus=01 Lev=01 Prnt=01 Port=00 Cnt=01 Dev#= 10 Spd=480 MxCh= 5
D: Ver= 2.10 Cls=09(hub ) Sub=00 Prot=02 MxPS=64 #Cfgs= 1
P: Vendor=0bda ProdID=5487 Rev= 1.47

E: Ad=81(I) Atr=03(Int.) MxPS= 1 Ivl=256ms
The failure results from the ETIMEDOUT by chance when turning on
the suspend feature for the specified port of the hub. The port
seems to be in an unknown state so the hub\_activate during resume
fails the hub\_port\_status, then the hub will fail to work.
The quirky hub needs the reset-resume quirk to function correctly.

ALSA: usb-audio: Fix implicit sync clearance at stopping stream
commit 988cc17552606be67a956cf8cd6ff504cfc5d643 upstream.
The recent endpoint management change for implicit feedback mode added
a clearance of ep->sync\_sink (formerly ep->sync\_slave) pointer at
snd\_usb\_endpoint\_stop() to assure no leftover for the feedback from
the already stopped capture stream. This turned out to cause a
regression, however, when full-duplex streams were running and only a
capture was stopped. Because of the above clearance of ep->sync\_sink
pointer, no more feedback is done, hence the playback will stall.
This patch fixes the ep->sync\_sink clearance to be done only after all
endpoints are released, for addressing the regression.

ovl: allow upperdir inside lowerdir
commit 708fa01597fa002599756bf56a96d0de1677375c upstream.
Commit 146d62e5a586 ("ovl: detect overlapping layers") made sure we don't
have overlapping layers, but it also broke the arguably valid use case of
mount -olowerdir=/,upperdir=/subdir,..
where upperdir overlaps lowerdir on the same filesystem. This has been
causing regressions.
Revert the check, but only for the specific case where upperdir and/or
workdir are subdirectories of lowerdir. Any other overlap (e.g. lowerdir
is subdirectory of upperdir, etc) case is crazy, so leave the check in
place for those.
Overlaps are detected at lookup time too, so reverting the mount time check
should be safe.

ovl: fix leaked dentry

Since commit 6815f479ca90 ("ovl: use only uppermetacopy state in

metacopy error, which leads to dentry leaks when shutting down the related

net: qrtr: Avoid potential use after free in MHI send
commit 47a017f33943278570c072bc71681809b2567b3a upstream.
It is possible that the MHI ul\_callback will be invoked immediately
following the queueing of the skb for transmission, leading to the
callback decrementing the refcount of the associated sk and freeing the
skb.
As such the dereference of skb and the increment of the sk refcount must

bpf: Fix leakage of uninitialized bpf stack under speculation
commit 801c6058d14a82179a7ee17a4b532cac6fad067f upstream.
The current implemented mechanisms to mitigate data disclosure under
speculation mainly address stack and map value oob access from the
speculative domain. However, Piotr discovered that uninitialized BPF
stack is not protected yet, and thus old data from the kernel stack,
potentially including addresses of kernel structures, could still be
extracted from that 512 bytes large window. The BPF stack is special
compared to map values since it's not zero initialized for every
program invocation, whereas map values /are/ zero initialized upon
their initial allocation and thus cannot leak any prior data in either
domain. In the non-speculative domain, the verifier ensures that every
stack slot read must have a prior stack slot write by the BPF program
to avoid such data leaking issue.
However, this is not enough: for example, when the pointer arithmetic
operation moves the stack pointer from the last valid stack offset to
the first valid offset, the sanitation logic allows for any intermediate
offsets during speculative execution, which could then be used to
extract any restricted stack content via side-channel.
Given for unprivileged stack pointer arithmetic the use of unknown
but bounded scalars is generally forbidden, we can simply turn the
register-based arithmetic operation into an immediate-based arithmetic
operation without the need for masking. This also gives the benefit
of reducing the needed instructions for the operation. Given after
the work in 7fedb63a8307 ("bpf: Tighten speculative pointer arithmetic
mask"), the aux->alu\_limit already holds the final immediate value for
the offset register with the known scalar. Thus, a simple mov of the
immediate to AX register with using AX as the source for the original
instruction is sufficient and possible now in this case.

bpf: Fix masking negation logic upon negative dst register
commit b9b34ddbe2076ade359cd5ce7537d5ed019e9807 upstream.
The negation logic for the case where the off\_reg is sitting in the
dst register is not correct given then we cannot just invert the add
to a sub or vice versa. As a fix, perform the final bitwise and-op
unconditionally into AX from the off\_reg, then move the pointer from
the src to dst and finally use AX as the source for the original
pointer arithmetic operation such that the inversion yields a correct
result. The single non-AX mov in between is possible given constant
blinding is retaining it as it's not an immediate based operation.

drm/i915: Disable runtime power management during shutdown
commit 7962893ecb853aa7c8925ce237ab6c4274cfc1c7 upstream.
At least on some TGL platforms PUNIT wants to access some display HW
registers, but it doesn't handle display power management (disabling DC
states as required) and so this register access will lead to a hang. To
prevent this disable runtime power management for poweroff and reboot.
v2:
- Add code comment clarifying the requirement of display power states.

netfilter: conntrack: Make global sysctls readonly in non-init netns
commit 2671fa4dc0109d3fb581bc3078fdf17b5d9080f6 upstream.
These sysctls point to global variables:
- NF\_SYSCTL\_CT\_MAX (&nf\_conntrack\_max)
- NF\_SYSCTL\_CT\_EXPECT\_MAX (&nf\_ct\_expect\_max)
- NF\_SYSCTL\_CT\_BUCKETS (&nf\_conntrack\_htable\_size\_user)
Because their data pointers are not updated to point to per-netns
structures, they must be marked read-only in a non-init\_net ns.
Otherwise, changes in any net namespace are reflected in (leaked into)
all other net namespaces. This problem has existed since the
introduction of net namespaces.
The current logic marks them read-only only if the net namespace is
owned by an unprivileged user (other than init\_user\_ns).
Commit d0febd81ae77 ("netfilter: conntrack: re-visit sysctls in
unprivileged namespaces") "exposes all sysctls even if the namespace is
unpriviliged." Since we need to mark them readonly in any case, we can
forego the unprivileged user check altogether.

mips: Do not include hi and lo in clobber list for R6
commit 1d7ba0165d8206ac073f7ac3b14fc0836b66eae7 upstream.
From [1]
"GCC 10 (PR 91233) won't silently allow registers that are not
architecturally available to be present in the clobber list anymore,
resulting in build failure for mips\*r6 targets in form of:
...
.../sysdep.h:146:2: error: the register ‘lo’ cannot be clobbered in ‘asm’ for the current target
146 | \_\_asm\_\_ volatile ( \
| ^~~~~~~
This is because base R6 ISA doesn't define hi and lo registers w/o DSP
extension. This patch provides the alternative clobber list for r6 targets
that won't include those registers."
Since kernel 5.4 and mips support for generic vDSO [2], the kernel fail to
build for mips r6 cpus with gcc 10 for the same reason as glibc.
