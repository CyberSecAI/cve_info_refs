Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The root cause of the vulnerability is the use of `strcpy` to copy user-provided data into a fixed-size buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function copies data from the `urls` POST parameter into a heap-allocated buffer. If the length of the `urls` parameter exceeds the buffer size, it will lead to a heap-based buffer overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** The immediate impact of the vulnerability is a crash of the web server, leading to a denial of service.
- **Potential for further exploitation:** While the author mentions that direct control of the program pointer isn't possible due to the heap-based nature of the overflow, it is possible to overwrite other heap data which could potentially lead to other forms of exploitation.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/saveParentControlInfo` endpoint with an overly long value in the `urls` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP POST requests to the vulnerable endpoint on the Tenda AC10-1200 router.
- No specific prior knowledge or privileges are mentioned as requirements to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- The exploit requires the `time` POST parameter to be included, otherwise the request will exit early before reaching the vulnerable strcpy.
- The overflow occurs in heap memory, rather than the stack.
- The author states other parameters like `deviceId` and `time` are also vulnerable but does not analyze them in detail, only mentioning that they are already associated with CVE-2020â€“13393.
