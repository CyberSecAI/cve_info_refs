- **Root cause of vulnerability:** HTTP header injection vulnerability.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The IBM DataPower Gateway is vulnerable to HTTP header injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The bulletin does not specify the impact of the vulnerability, but HTTP header injection can lead to various issues like session hijacking, cross-site scripting, and other attacks.
- **Attack vectors:** The bulletin does not specify the attack vectors. However, HTTP header injection occurs when user-supplied data is included in the header without proper sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The bulletin does not specify the attacker capabilities/position. However, an attacker needs to be able to send crafted requests to the IBM DataPower Gateway to inject malicious headers.
