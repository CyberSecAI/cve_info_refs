The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38469.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The affected product's services do not specify full paths for the DLLs they load.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Uncontrolled search path element (CWE-427). The application loads DLLs without specifying the full path.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can exploit this by placing a malicious DLL with the same name as the one being loaded in a directory that is searched before the legitimate location. This can lead to the hijacking of the loaded DLL which can grant the attacker the ability to perform malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can implant their own DLL near the affected product's binaries and achieve remote code execution.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have the ability to write a malicious DLL on the file system of the affected product.
The vulnerability can be exploited remotely with low attack complexity and no user interaction.
