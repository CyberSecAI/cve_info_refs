Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authentication and authorization checks when deleting doctor records. Specifically, the application allows deletion of doctor records via a crafted HTTP request without requiring the user to be authenticated as a receptionist or administrator.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Missing Authentication:** The application does not verify the user's identity before processing the delete request.
*   **Missing Authorization:** Even if authenticated, the application does not check if the user has the necessary privileges (receptionist or admin role) to delete doctor records.
*   **Direct Object Reference:** It appears the application directly uses the doctor ID in the request, which is sent to server side without any validation or authorization check.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification/Deletion:** Attackers can delete doctor records from the system without proper authorization. This can lead to loss of data and disruption of services, affecting the hospital's ability to manage appointments and patient care.
*  **Potential for further attack:** An attacker might exploit this vulnerability to disrupt the operations of hospital, by maliciously deleting important data

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Network Attack:** The attacker crafts a specific HTTP request with the target doctor ID and sends it to the server without proper authorization/authentication.
*  **Remote Exploitation:** The attacker can be remote and does not need to be on the same network as the targeted server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the server hosting the application.
*   **Knowledge of HTTP requests:** The attacker needs to know how to craft a malicious HTTP request.
*   **Knowledge of target API:** The attacker needs to know the structure of the HTTP request required to delete a doctor record including the parameter used to identify the record to be deleted.
