The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38473.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper restriction of operations within the bounds of a memory buffer. The affected product's code doesn't properly control arguments for specific functions, leading to a potential stack overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Improper Restriction of Operations Within the Bounds of a Memory Buffer (CWE-119)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to remote code execution, allowing an attacker to gain complete remote control over the machine.

**Attack vectors:**
Network-based attacks via the affected product's API. An attacker would send crafted arguments to vulnerable functions that lack proper argument checking.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable system and must be able to send specially crafted requests to the affected API functions. They require low privileges and user interaction is required.
