- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is due to the lack of proper input sanitization, which allows users to embed arbitrary JavaScript code.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-site scripting (XSS).
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution in the user's browser, potentially allowing an attacker to steal credentials within a trusted session and alter the intended functionality of the web UI.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through the web UI of IBM QRadar Advisor, where an attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious JavaScript code into the application through a user-controlled input field in the web UI. This would likely require authenticated access to the application.
