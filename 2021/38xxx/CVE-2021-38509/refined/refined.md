{
  "CVE-2021-38509": {
    "description": "Due to an unusual sequence of attacker-controlled events, a Javascript `alert()` dialog with arbitrary (although unstyled) contents could be displayed over top an uncontrolled webpage of the attacker's choosing.",
    "root_cause": "A cached boolean value related to dialog management was not being updated correctly, leading to a premature removal of the web progress listener which would close the dialog on navigation. This allowed an attacker to use a sequence of events to open a dialog in a new context that would not be properly closed on navigation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect dialog management logic",
      "Improper handling of dialogs across different contexts"
    ],
    "impact": "Spoofing of content using arbitrary JavaScript alert dialogs on arbitrary domains. This could be used for phishing attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
        "Attacker-controlled website",
         "JavaScript execution"
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control a website, host Javascript code, and trick the user into interacting with it.",
    "references": [
      "https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1718571"
    ],
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability involves exploiting a race condition where the browser incorrectly assumes that a dialog is the last one and prematurely cleans up resources which results in the dialog persisting after navigation."
