The provided content describes a persistent Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in a Hospital Management System, specifically within the prescription functionality.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper sanitization or encoding of user-supplied input when generating prescriptions. Specifically, it appears that the "prescribe.php" page is vulnerable.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Persistent XSS: Malicious JavaScript code injected by a doctor via a prescription is stored in the database and executed when an administrator views the affected page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the admin userâ€™s browser.
- This can lead to a variety of malicious actions like:
    - Stealing session cookies.
    - Redirecting the administrator to a malicious site.
    - Performing actions on behalf of the admin (e.g. account takeover, changing system settings).

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the prescription functionality that can be accessed by the doctor role.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the role of a doctor to create malicious prescriptions.
- The vulnerability is triggered when an administrator logs in and views the affected page.
