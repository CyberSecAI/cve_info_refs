| Hi, how is going? I test imgurl upload functions. And I found a XSS vulnarability. First step： Put payload on upload header : `X-Forwarded-For: "><img src=# onerror=alert(/a/)>`  [a](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30430287/129504791-dceafb9f-e58e-4f3a-82da-87b8790d0d68.png)  [微信截图_20210816093947](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30430287/129501918-bb2ca1a0-244b-45c9-8bbe-6d7eb738f8cb.png) Second then web administrator click  [微信截图_20210816094107](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30430287/129501989-60ab6765-8ebf-4e74-a1a1-506f559d2503.png)  [微信截图_20210816094127](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30430287/129502002-64c59e3c-d8ea-491c-ac0c-eeb5188ac80d.png)  [微信截图_20210816094207](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/30430287/129502015-13a6f8ef-fc69-4181-941d-6197025f094a.png)   ---  The method to solve it: all the request header filter special character。  过滤http请求头的所有特殊字符。 |

| 感谢您的反馈，这应该是由于获取用户IP的时候，XFF头没有进行验证导致。我修复一下。 |
