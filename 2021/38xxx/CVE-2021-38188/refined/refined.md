- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `iced_x86::Decoder::new` function used `slice.get_unchecked(slice.length())` to get the end position of the input buffer, which invokes undefined behavior.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Undefined behavior due to out-of-bounds access using `get_unchecked`.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The undefined behavior may lead to soundness issues in crates using the `iced_x86::Decoder` struct.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when using the `iced_x86::Decoder::new` function with a crafted input buffer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to provide the input buffer to the `iced_x86::Decoder::new` function.
