Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the information related to CVE-2021-38379:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   CFEngine Enterprise uses the `/tmp` directory within the HTML document root to store temporary files, which are accessed by users of the Mission Portal web interface.
*   This same directory was also used to store exported reports, making them publicly accessible via predictable URLs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Storage:** Exported reports were stored in a publicly accessible directory (`/tmp` within the web document root).
*   **Predictable File Names:** The filenames of exported reports were easily predictable, allowing an attacker to guess the URL.
*   **Lack of Access Control:** No proper access controls were implemented to prevent unauthorized access to the exported reports.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker with network access to the CFEngine hub machine can obtain exported reports generated by users in Mission Portal.
*   These reports may contain sensitive data.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   An attacker can make HTTP requests to the hub machine (port 443) using easily predictable URLs to access the exported reports.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker needs to have network access to the CFEngine hub machine (typically via port 443).
*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the hub server.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability affects all deployments of CFEngine Enterprise version 3.5 and newer, including many unsupported versions.
*   The issue was discovered internally during development and testing.
*   There were no indications of exploitation prior to the fix.
*   The fix involves storing exported reports in a separate, non-public directory with unpredictable file names.
*   Client machines are not affected by this vulnerability, only the hub server.
*   The affected versions have been replaced with new packages that fix the vulnerability with `-2` added to the file name.
