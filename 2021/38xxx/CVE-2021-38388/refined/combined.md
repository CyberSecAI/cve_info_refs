### @minwoox **[minwoox](/minwoox)** commented [Aug 10, 2021](#issue-964540588)

Motivation:

We should prohibit mirroring to internal repositories which can cause a security incident.

Modification:

* Raise an exception if the `localRepo` of mirroring setting is one of `meta` and `dogma` which are internal repositories.

Result:

* You cannot set up mirroring to internal repositories anymore.

Sorry, something went wrong.
