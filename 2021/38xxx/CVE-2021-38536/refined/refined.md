The provided content is related to a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which was assigned the internal identifier PSV-2019-0193, and it affects multiple Netgear router and gateway models. However, it explicitly states "Associated CVE IDs: None". Therefore it does not relate to the specified CVE-2021-38536.

Instead of providing information on the specified CVE, the content provides information on a separate vulnerability including:

- **Root Cause of Vulnerability:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). The content does not specify the exact location where user-provided data is stored unsanitized.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** The vulnerability is a stored XSS, which means that malicious scripts can be stored on the affected devices.
- **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to malicious script execution within the context of a user's browser when accessing the router's management interface. This could result in actions being performed on behalf of the user, including potentially stealing cookies/sessions or redirecting users to malicious websites. This is not detailed in this document.
- **Attack Vectors:** The attacker would need to inject malicious scripts through an unspecified input field or form, and this script would then be stored on the device and executed when an administrator logs into the device.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to have some access to the device's management interface to inject the malicious script. It is implied that they would need some level of authentication to access the vulnerable interface. CVSS indicates the attacker needs to be adjacent to the network, have high privilege and a user needs to be involved.

The document lists specific vulnerable Netgear product models and firmware versions. It also provides instructions on how to download and install updated firmware to mitigate the vulnerability. It includes a CVSS v3 score and vector for the vulnerability.
