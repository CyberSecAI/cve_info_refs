# Corero SecureWatch Managed Services 9.7.2.0020 Multiple Broken Access Control

Corero SecureWatch Managed Services 9.7.2.0020 does not correctly check swa-monitor and cns-monitor user’s privileges, allowing a user to perform actions not belonging to his role.

## Product Description (from vendor)

“SecureWatch Managed Services are a comprehensive suite of configuration optimization, monitoring and mitigation response services. This round-the-clock service, delivered by Coreroâs highly experienced Security Operations Center, is tailored to meet the security policy requirements and business goals of each SmartWall customer that engages in a SecureWatch managed service plan.” More information is available at <https://www.corero.com/product/managed-ddos-protection-services/>

### CVE

* [CVE-2021-38137](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38137)

### Root Cause Analysis

Users with specific roles can perform privileged operations outside of the scope of their role.

Users with the “swa-monitor” role can interact with the following HTTP API endpoints on the target host:

* “get\_snapshot\_list”: used to provide a list of available snapshots
* “get\_snapshot”: used to download snapshots in pkg format
* “get\_packages”: used to provide a list of installed packages and related version
* “get\_settings”: used to provide some information about the server’s network configurations
* “settings”: used to provide information about the splunk configuration

Furthermore, a user with the “cns-monitor” role can reach the following endpoint on the target host:

* “/system/diagnostics”: used to manage the log files.

### Proof of Concept

1. Login with user of role “swa-monitor”
2. Get the snapshots list: `https://$host:8000/it-IT/splunkd/__raw/services/get_snapshot_list`
3. Notice the reponse containing the list of available snapshots

### Impact

An attacker with access to a “swa-monitor” or “cns-monitor” account can perform privileged operations and gain access to reserved information.

### Remediation

Upgrade Corero SecureWatch Managed Services to version 9.7.5 or later. (Note: we didn’t verify the patch.)
