- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application does not correctly check the privileges of `swa-monitor` and `cns-monitor` users, allowing them to perform actions beyond their intended roles.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Broken access control, insufficient privilege validation.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker with `swa-monitor` or `cns-monitor` access can perform privileged operations and gain access to sensitive information. Specifically, `swa-monitor` users can access snapshots, installed packages, server network configurations, and splunk configurations. `cns-monitor` users can manage log files.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs through the HTTP API endpoints accessible to the vulnerable user roles.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs valid credentials for a `swa-monitor` or `cns-monitor` user account.
