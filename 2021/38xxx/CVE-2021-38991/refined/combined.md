The AIX and VIOS fixes can be downloaded via ftp or http from:

ftp://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/lscore\_fix.tar
<http://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/lscore_fix.tar>
<https://aix.software.ibm.com/aix/efixes/security/lscore_fix.tar>

The link above is to a tar file containing this signed advisory, fix packages, and OpenSSL signatures for each package. The fixes below include prerequisite checking. This will enforce the correct mapping between the fixes and AIX Technology Levels.

| AIX Level | Interim Fix |
| --- | --- |
| 7.1.5.7 | IJ36805s9a.211217.epkg.Z |
| 7.1.5.8 | IJ36805s9a.211217.epkg.Z |

| 7.3.0.1 | IJ36816s1a.211217.epkg.Z |

Please note that the above table refers to AIX TL/SP level as opposed to fileset level, i.e., 7.2.5.2 is AIX 7200-05-02.

Please reference the Affected Products and Version section above for help with checking installed fileset levels.

| VIOS Level | Interim Fix |
| --- | --- |
| 3.1.1.21 | IJ36806s2a.211217.epkg.Z |
| 3.1.1.25 | IJ36806s2a.211217.epkg.Z |
| 3.1.1.30 | IJ36806s4a.211217.epkg.Z |

To extract the fixes from the tar file:

tar xvf lscore\_fix.tar
cd lscore\_fix

Verify you have retrieved the fixes intact:

The checksums below were generated using the "openssl dgst -sha256 [filename]" command as the following:

These sums should match exactly. The OpenSSL signatures in the tar file and on this advisory can also be used to verify the integrity of the fixes.  If the sums or signatures cannot be confirmed, contact IBM Support at <http://ibm.com/support/> and describe the discrepancy.

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [advisory\_file].sig [advisory\_file]

openssl dgst -sha256 -verify [pubkey\_file] -signature [ifix\_file].sig [ifix\_file]

**C. FIX AND INTERIM FIX INSTALLATION**

If possible, it is recommended that a mksysb backup of the system be created. Verify it is both bootable and readable before proceeding.

To preview a fix installation:

installp -a -d fix\_name -p all  # where fix\_name is the name of the
                                            # fix package being previewed.

To install a fix package:

installp -a -d fix\_name -X all  # where fix\_name is the name of the
                                            # fix package being installed.

Interim fixes have had limited functional and regression testing but not the full regression testing that takes place for Service Packs; however, IBM does fully support them.

Interim fix management documentation can be found at:

<http://www14.software.ibm.com/webapp/set2/sas/f/aix.efixmgmt/home.html>

To preview an interim fix installation:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -p         # where ipkg\_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being previewed.

To install an interim fix package:

emgr -e ipkg\_name -X         # where ipkg\_name is the name of the
                                         # interim fix package being installed.
