Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-38410:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a DLL hijacking issue caused by an uncontrolled search path element in the AVEVA Platform Common Services (PCS) Portal.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Uncontrolled Search Path Element (CWE-427):** The application's search path for loading DLLs is not properly controlled, allowing an attacker to insert a malicious DLL in a location searched by the application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Malicious Code Execution:** If exploited, the vulnerability could lead to the execution of arbitrary code within the context of the PCS Portal application. This could potentially allow an attacker to gain control of the system or perform other malicious activities.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Local Access:** The vulnerability is not exploitable remotely. An attacker needs local access to the system where the affected software is installed.
- **DLL Hijacking:** The attacker places a malicious DLL in a location that is part of the uncontrolled search path that the vulnerable application uses when loading DLL files.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Local Access:** The attacker needs to have local access to the target system.
- **File Write Access:** The attacker needs the ability to write files to a location in the DLL search path that the application uses.
- **User Interaction:** The user needs to trigger the vulnerable application, and the malicious DLL will be loaded during this process.

**Affected Products:**

- AVEVA Platform Common Services (PCS) Portal versions: 4.5.2, 4.5.1, 4.5.0, and 4.4.6
- The following products ship with vulnerable PCS Portal versions:
