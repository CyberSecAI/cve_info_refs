The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38440.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing project files in FATEK Automation WinProladder software. This lack of validation leads to an out-of-bounds read.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the out-of-bounds read vulnerability may allow an attacker to read unauthorized information.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a malformed project file that is opened by a user of the WinProladder software.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to craft a malformed project file and convince a user to open it using the vulnerable WinProladder software. This suggests a local attack vector and requires user interaction.
