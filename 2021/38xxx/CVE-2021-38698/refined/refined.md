Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-38698:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a missing authorization check in the `Txn.Apply` endpoint of HashiCorp Consul. Specifically, the system failed to properly enforce ACL token policies when registering service proxies.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Authorization:** The core issue was that a user with `service:write` permissions for *any* service could register a proxy for *any other* service, regardless of whether they were authorized to do so.
*   **ACL Bypass:**  This lack of proper authorization effectively bypassed the intended access control mechanisms provided by Consul's ACL tokens.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Service Masquerading:** An attacker could register a malicious proxy for a target service they were not authorized to manage.
*  **Traffic interception/redirection:** The malicious proxy would receive traffic intended for the legitimate service. This could enable data exfiltration, man-in-the-middle attacks, or denial-of-service by interrupting the target service.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability is triggered by making a request to the `Txn.Apply` endpoint.
*   The attack vector involves the misuse of `service:write` permissions to register unauthorized proxies.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Valid ACL Token:** The attacker must possess a valid Consul ACL token with `service:write` permissions for at least one service.

**Additional Details**

*   The vulnerability affected Consul and Consul Enterprise versions through 1.10.1.
*   The fix is included in versions 1.8.15, 1.9.9, and 1.10.2 and later.
*   The vulnerability was discovered during internal testing by the Consul engineering team, and a bulletin was released on September 1, 2021.
*   The Gentoo security advisory indicates that the vulnerability is remotely exploitable.
