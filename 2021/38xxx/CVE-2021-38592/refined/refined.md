{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "Heap-buffer-overflow in the `op_Const64` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Heap-buffer-overflow.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Crash due to a heap-buffer-overflow.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability occurs when processing a crafted WebAssembly module with a `Const64` instruction. The specific instruction and module structure cause the `op_Const64` to write beyond the allocated memory.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious WebAssembly module that triggers the vulnerability when executed by wasm3."
