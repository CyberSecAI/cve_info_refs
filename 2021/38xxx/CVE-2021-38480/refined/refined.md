- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The InHand Networks IR615 Router is vulnerable to cross-site request forgery (CSRF) attacks because it does not properly validate requests, allowing an attacker to perform unauthorized actions on behalf of a trusted user.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) (CWE-352)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can remotely perform actions on the routerâ€™s management portal, such as making configuration changes, changing administrator credentials, and running system commands on the router.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can send unauthorized commands from a user that the web application trusts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need prior access or privileges, but must be able to trick a user into submitting a request that performs an action on the router's management portal. This often involves social engineering tactics to lure a user to click a malicious link or visit a malicious page.
