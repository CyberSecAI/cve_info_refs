Eclipse Cyclone DDS™ is an implementation of the OMG Data Distribution Service (DDS) specification (see http://www.omg.org/spec/DDS/ ) and the related specifications for interoperability (see http://www.omg.org/spec/DDSI-RTPS/ )

With 'DATA' being 'the currency of the IOT', having a proper data-sharing technology will be a key-asset in any IOT-platform. The OMG DDS standard is recognized as a highly applicable standard for reliable and robust data-sharing in business- and mission-critical environments (see <http://www.iiconsortium.org/IIRA.htm> and <http://www.iiconsortium.org/IICF.htm> ) and with that a great fit with the Eclipse-IOT ecosystem.

Eclipse Cyclone DDS offers unique data-sharing capabilities compared to the already existing Eclipse solutions (i.e. for messaging).

Its data-centric architecture (where data has RDBMS-like structure and relations rather than 'blobs' as typically used in lower level messaging products) combined with the capability to 'annotate' the data(-models) with fine-grained QoS properties (for reliability, urgency, persistency etc.) provide unrivalled functional and non-functional properties for time- and mission/business-critical IOT-systems.

With a history of proven applicability in the military C4I domain (that are not so much unlike upcoming large-scale IOT-systems where you can also distinguish between planning-, awareness- and execution-grids that all impose specific requirements w.r.t. interoperabillity, high-volume data-sharing and deterministic/real-time data-access) we are confident that  starting from day-1 this offering can significantly reduce the complexity of many IOT-systems and with that reduce their integration efforts and risks.

Furthermore we are confident that the Eclipse-IOT ecosystem will benefit even more by active participation in the evolution of this technology and the (OMG-)standard its based upon.

CISA is aware of a public report detailing vulnerabilities found in multiple open-source and proprietary Object Management Group (OMG) Data-Distribution Service (DDS) implementations. This advisory addresses a vulnerability that originates within, and affects the implementation of, the DDS standard. In addition, this advisory addresses other vulnerabilities found within the DDS implementation. CISA is issuing this advisory to provide early notice of the reported vulnerabilities and identify baseline mitigations for reducing risks to these and other cybersecurity attacks.

## 2. UPDATE INFORMATION

This updated advisory is a follow-up to the original advisory titled ICSA-21-315-02 Multiple Data Distribution Service (DDS) Implementations that was published November 11, 2021, to the ICS webpage on www.cisa.gov/uscert.

## 3. RISK EVALUATION

Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities could result in denial-of-service or buffer-overflow conditions, which may lead to remote code execution or information exposure.

## 4. TECHNICAL DETAILS

Eclipse CycloneDDS versions prior to 0.8.0 improperly handle invalid structures, which may allow an attacker to write arbitrary values in the XML parser.

[CVE-2021-38443](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-38443) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H)).

#### 4.2.3    [INSUFFICIENT CONTROL OF NETWORK MESSAGE VOLUME (NETWORK AMPLIFICATION) CWE-406](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/406.html)

eProsima Fast DDS versions prior to 2.4.0 (#2269) are susceptible to exploitation when an attacker sends a specially crafted packet to flood a target device with unwanted traffic, which may result in a denial-of-service condition and information exposure.

**--------- Begin Update A Part 1 of 4---------**

[CVE-2021-38425](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-38425) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 7.5 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H)).

**--------- End Update A Part 1 of 4 ---------**

#### 4.2.4    [INCORRECT CALCULATION OF BUFFER SIZE CWE-131](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/131.html)

All versions of GurumDDS improperly calculate the size to be used when allocating the buffer, which may result in a buffer overflow.

[CVE-2021-38423](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-38423) has been assigned to this vulnerability. A CVSS v3 base score of 6.6 has been calculated; the CVSS vector string is ([AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H](https://www.first.org/cvss/calculator/3.0#CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H)).

#### 4.2.5    [HEAP-BASED BUFFER OVERFLOW CWE-122](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/122.html)

All versions of GurumDDS are vulnerable to heap-based buffer overflow, which may cause a denial-of-service condition or remotely execute arbitrary code.

[CVE-2021-38439](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-38439) has been assigned to this vulnerability.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

Eclipse recommends users apply the [latest CycloneDDS patches](https://projects.eclipse.org/projects/iot.cyclonedds).

eProsima recommends users apply the [latest Fast DDS patches](https://github.com/eProsima/Fast-DDS).

CISA reached out to Gurum Networks but did not respond to requests for coordination. Users should contact GurumNetworks for assistance.

OCI recommends users update to [Version 3.18.1](https://opendds.org/) of OpenDDS or later.

RTI recommends users apply the available patches for these issues. A patch is available on the [RTI customer portal](https://support.rti.com/s/login/?ec=302&startURL=%2Fs%2F) or by contacting RTI Support. Also, contact RTI Support for mitigations, including how to use RTI DDS Secure to mitigate against the network amplification issue defined by [CVE-2021-38487](http://web.nvd.nist.gov/view/vuln/detail?vulnId=CVE-2021-38487)

Twin Oaks Computing recommends users apply CoreDX DDS Version 5.9.1 or later, which can be downloaded on the [Twin Oaks website](http://www.twinoakscomputing.com/coredx/download) (login required).

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Additional mitigation guidance and recommended practices are publicly available on the [ICS webpage on cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics) in the Technical Information Paper, [ICS-TIP-12-146-01B--Targeted Cyber Intrusion Detection and Mitigation Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/tips/ICS-TIP-12-146-01B).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
