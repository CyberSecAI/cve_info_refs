{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The Chikitsa Patient Management System version 2.0.0 is vulnerable to stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) due to insufficient input sanitization/validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Lack of input sanitization/validation"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can execute arbitrary JavaScript in a user's browser, potentially leading to privilege escalation, session hijacking, defacement of the application, or other malicious actions. The injected script is stored in the application's database and executed every time an affected page is accessed.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious JavaScript payloads are inserted into user input fields.",
        "Specific vulnerable pages are:",
        "/index.php/admin/add_user",
        "/index.php/appointment/todos",
        "/index.php/appointment/insert_patient_add_appointment/(hr of apppointment)/(minute of appointment)//Appointments//0/"
    ],
     "required_capabilities": "An attacker requires a user account with privileges to create/modify user records, or appointments in the application. Specifically, user creation on `/index.php/admin/add_user` seems to be used in the proof of concept. Access to modify other entities through the vulnerable endpoints would also be needed."
