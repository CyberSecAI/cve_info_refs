higher.

## Setup and installation

Download and install the version of the client that you need as
follows:

| To install... | Do this |
| --- | --- |
| 5.x client | Open [Amazon WorkSpaces Client Downloads](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/) and find the WorkSpaces Windows client. Under **Get the latest 64 bit client**, choose the **Download** button. |
| 4.x client | Open [Previous Versions](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/Versions.html). Find the WorkSpaces Windows client version and choose the **Download** button. |
| 3.x client | Open [Amazon WorkSpaces Client Downloads](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/) and find the WorkSpaces Windows client. Under **Get the latest 32-bit client**, choose the **Download** button. |

You have two choices for how to install the Amazon WorkSpaces Windows client application:

* **Install just for you**. If you choose this option and you
  share your local machine with other users, the WorkSpaces client application is
  available only to you. If other users on the machine also want to use the
  WorkSpaces client application, they must install the application for their own
  use.
* **Install for all users of this machine**. If you choose this
  option, the WorkSpaces client application is available to anyone who logs on to
  the local machine, including those with Guest accounts.

Installing the WorkSpaces client application for all users requires you to have
administrator privileges on your local machine. Depending on how your local machine is
configured, you might not have such privileges. In that case, you can install the
WorkSpaces client application just for yourself. If you have questions about which
option to choose, ask your WorkSpaces administrator for guidance.

When installing the client 4.0+ version, you will have an option to install the USB
redirection driver for features like Yubikey U2F redirection support. Use the following
procedure to install the USB redirection driver.

###### To install the USB redirection driver

1. On the Amazon WorkSpaces Setup page, select **Install for all users of
   this machine**. Choose **Next**.

   ![Selection of scope and folder](/images/workspaces/latest/userguide/images/installation_1.png)
2. Select **Install driver for USB redirection** to enable the
   USB redirection features (the default setting is not selected). Choose
   **Install**. You must have administrator privileges to
   install the driver.

   ![Selection of install driver for USB redirection](/images/workspaces/latest/userguide/images/installer_string_draft2_box_checked.png)
3. To install the client with PCoIP USB redirection, enter and run the following
   command in an elevated command prompt.

   ```
   msiexec.exe /i "[path to msi]" /qn INSTALL_USB="1" ALLUSERS="1"
   ```

   To install the client without PCoIP USB redirection, enter and run the
   following command in an elevated command prompt.

   ```
   msiexec.exe /i "[path to msi]" /qn ALLUSERS="1"
   ```

If you're having trouble updating your WorkSpaces Windows client application to a newer
version, use the following procedure to update your client application.

###### To update the WorkSpaces Windows client application to a newer version

1. On your local machine, open the Windows search box and enter
   `registry editor` to open the Registry Editor
   (**regedit.exe**).
2. When asked "Do you want to allow this app to make changes to your device?",
   choose **Yes**.
3. In the Registry Editor, navigate to the following registry entry:

   **Computer\HKEY\_CURRENT\_USER\Software\Amazon Web Services. LLC\Amazon
   WorkSpaces\WinSparkle**
4. Delete the **SkipThisVersion** registry key. When prompted to
   confirm the deletion, choose **Yes**, and then close the
   Registry Editor.
5. If you have not already entered a registration code in the WorkSpaces Windows
   client application, do so, and then choose **Amazon WorkSpaces**,
   **Quit Amazon WorkSpaces** to close the client application.
6. Restart the WorkSpaces Windows client application. You should be prompted to
   update the client. Accept the update.
## Determine your client version

To see which version of the WorkSpaces client you have, choose
**Amazon WorkSpaces**, **About Amazon WorkSpaces**, or click the
gear icon in the upper-right corner and choose **About
Amazon WorkSpaces**.

## Connect to your WorkSpace

To connect to your WorkSpace, complete the following procedure.

1. The first time that you run the client application, you are prompted
   for your registration code, which is contained in your welcome email.
   The WorkSpaces client application uses the registration code and user name to
   identify which WorkSpace to connect to. When you launch the client
   application later, the same registration code is used. To enter a
   different registration code, launch the client application, and then
   choose **Change Registration Code** at the bottom of
   the login page.
2. Enter your sign-in credentials in the login screen and choose
   **Sign In**. If your
   WorkSpaces administrator has enabled multi-factor authentication for your
   organization's WorkSpaces, you are prompted for a passcode to complete your
   login. Your WorkSpaces administrator will provide more information about how to
   obtain your passcode.
3. If your WorkSpaces administrator has not disabled the **Keep me
   logged in** feature, you can select the **Keep me
   logged in** check box at the bottom of the login screen to
   save your credentials securely so that you can connect to your WorkSpace
   easily while the client application remains running. Your credentials
   are securely cached up to the maximum lifetime of your Kerberos
   ticket.

   After the client application connects to your WorkSpace, your
   WorkSpace desktop is displayed.

An interruption of network connectivity causes an active session to be disconnected.
This can be caused by events such as closing the laptop lid, or the loss of your
wireless network connection. The WorkSpaces client application for Windows attempts to
reconnect the session automatically if network connectivity is regained within a certain
amount of time. The default session resume timeout is 20 minutes, but this timeout can
be modified by your network administrator.

## Manage your login information (3.0+ clients only)

You can view your registration code and what Region your WorkSpace is in. You can
specify whether you want the WorkSpaces client application to save your current
registration code, and you can assign a name to your WorkSpace. You can also specify if
you want Amazon WorkSpaces to keep you logged in to a WorkSpace until you quit or your
login period expires.

###### To manage your login information for a WorkSpace

1. In the WorkSpaces client application, go to **Settings**,
   **Manage Login Information**.
2. In the **Manage Login Information** dialog box, you can see
   the registration code and Region information for your WorkSpace.
3. (Optional) If you want the WorkSpaces client to remember your current
   registration code, select the **Remember Registration Code**
   check box.
4. Under **Saved registration codes**, select the WorkSpace that
   you want to name.
5. In the **WorkSpace name** box, enter a name for the
   WorkSpace.
6. (Optional) If you want WorkSpaces to keep you logged in until you quit or your
   login period expires, select the **Keep me logged in** check
   box.
7. Choose **Save**.
## Client views

You can switch to full screen mode by choosing **View**,
**Enter Full Screen** (3.0+ clients) in the client
application menu.

While in full screen mode, you can switch back to window mode by moving the pointer to
the top of the screen. The client application menu is displayed, and you can choose
**View**, **Leave Full Screen** (3.0+ clients) in the client application menu.

You can also toggle full screen mode by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Enter.

## Client language

You can select the language displayed by the client by performing the following
steps.

###### Note

The WorkSpaces client applications support Japanese. However, Japanese WorkSpaces
are available only in the Asia Pacific (Tokyo) Region.

###### To select the client language

1. Depending on which client you're using, do one of the following.

   | If you're using... | Do this |
   | --- | --- |
   | 3.0+ client | In the WorkSpaces client application, go to **Settings**, **Change Language**. |
2. Enter your desired language in the **Select a language** list
   and choose **Save**.
3. Restart the client.
## Display support

WorkSpaces Value, Standard, Performance, Power, PowerPro, Graphics.g4dn, GraphicsPro.g4dn,
and GraphicsPro bundles support a maximum of four displays and a maximum resolution of
3840x2160 (ultra-high definition, or UHD). The maximum supported resolution depends on
the number of displays, as shown in the following table.

| Displays | Resolution |
| --- | --- |
| 2 | 3840x2160 |
| 4 | 1920x1200 |

###### Note

* You can only extend the display. You cannot duplicate the display.
  Duplicating the display will cause your session to be disconnected.
* Graphics bundles support only a single monitor configuration with a
  maximum resolution of 2560x1600.

The WorkSpaces client application extracts the Extended Display Information Data (EDID) of
all attached displays and determines the best compatibility match before starting the
session. If you have a high pixel density (high DPI) display, the client application
automatically scales the streaming window according to your local DPI settings. For
better maximum resolution with high DPI displays, see [Enabling high DPI display for WorkSpaces](./high_dpi_support.html).

###### To use multiple monitors with WorkSpaces

1. Configure your local machine to use multiple monitors. For more information,
   see  [How to use multiple monitors in Windows 10](https://support.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/how-to-use-multiple-monitors-in-windows-329c6962-5a4d-b481-7baa-bec9671f728a) in the Microsoft
   documentation.
2. Start the WorkSpaces client application and log in to your WorkSpace.
3. Depending on which client you're using, do one of the following:

   | If you're using... | Do this |
   | --- | --- |
   | 3.0+ client | Choose **View**, **Enter Full Screen On All Displays**. You can also toggle full screen mode by pressing Ctrl+Alt+Enter. |

Your WorkSpace should now be extended across your displays. Whichever display you have
designated as your primary display is also the primary display in WorkSpaces when you
enter full screen mode.

###### Note

Using full screen mode on only some of the displays in a multiple monitor setup
isn't possible. You can, however, press the Windows logo key + Up Arrow or use the
maximize button in the upper-right corner of the WorkSpaces window to maximize the
WorkSpaces client window on a display without extending the WorkSpace to the other
displays.

## Proxy servers

If your network requires you to use a proxy server to access the internet, you can
enable your WorkSpaces client application to use a proxy for HTTPS (port 443) traffic. The
WorkSpaces client applications use the HTTPS port for updates, registration, and
authentication.

###### Note

* The desktop streaming connections to the WorkSpace require ports 4172 and
  4195 to be enabled, and do not go through the proxy server.
* Proxy servers that require authentication with sign-in credentials are not
  supported.

By default, the 3.0+ Windows clients use the proxy server that's specified in
the device operating system settings. The first time the client is launched, the
device operating system proxy server setting is used. If you select another
option for the proxy server, that setting is used for subsequent launches of the
client. If a proxy server is specified at both the operating system level and in
the WorkSpaces client, the client setting is used.

Starting with version 3.0.12 of the Windows client, you can also choose not to
use a proxy server.

###### Note

In versions 3.0.0 through 3.0.11, if you specify a custom proxy server, a
"No network" error might appear when you attempt to log in to your
WorkSpace. If you want to use a custom proxy server with the Windows client,
we recommend upgrading to the latest version.

1. In the WorkSpaces client application, go to **Settings**,
   **Manage Proxy Server**.
2. In the **Set Proxy** dialog box, select the
   appropriate options, depending on which version of the 3.0+ client you
   have.

   * **Windows client version 3.1.3 or
     later** â To disable usage of a proxy
     server, select **Don't use proxy server**. If
     you select **Don't use proxy server**, no proxy
     server is used when you access the internet.

     To use a proxy server, choose one of the following options,
     and then choose **Save**:

     + **Use your device operating system
       settings** â This option uses the
       proxy server settings for your operating system.
     + **Customize proxy server for
       WorkSpaces** â Enter the URL or IP
       address and the port for your custom proxy
       server.
   * **Windows client versions 3.0.12, 3.1.0,
     and 3.1.2** â To enable or disable usage of
     a proxy server, select or deselect **Use proxy
     server**. If you deselect **Use proxy
     server**, no proxy server is used when you access
     the internet.

     If you've selected **Use proxy server**,
     choose one of the following options, and then choose
     **Save**:

     + **Use your device operating system
       settings** â This option uses the
       proxy server settings for your operating system.
     + **Customize proxy server for
       WorkSpaces** â Enter the URL or IP
       address and the port for your custom proxy
       server.
   * **Windows client version 3.0.11 or
     earlier** â By default, these versions of
     the client use the proxy server specified in the device
     operating system settings. To use a custom proxy server, choose
     **Use proxy server**, enter the URL or IP
     address and the port for the proxy server, and then choose
     **Save**.
## Command shortcuts

The WorkSpaces Windows client supports the following command shortcuts:

* Ctrl+Alt+EnterâToggle full screen display
* Ctrl+Alt+F12âDisconnect session
## Disconnect

To disconnect the Windows client application, you have several options:

* In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, go to **Amazon WorkSpaces**, and
  then choose **Disconnect WorkSpace**. Your WorkSpace session
  ends, but the client application continues running in case you want to log in
  again.
* In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, go to **Amazon WorkSpaces**, and
  then choose **Quit Amazon WorkSpaces**. Your WorkSpace session ends,
  and the client application closes.
* In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, close the WorkSpaces client window by
  clicking the close (X) button in the upper-right corner. In the **End
  Session** dialog box, choose **Yes**. Your
  WorkSpace session ends, but the client application continues running in case you
  want to log in again.
* You can also log off of the WorkSpace. In the Amazon WorkSpaces client application, go
  to **View**, and then choose **Send
  Ctrl+Alt+Delete**. Choose **Sign Out**. Your
  WorkSpace session ends, but the client application continues running in case you
  want to log in again.
## Clipboard support

The clipboard supports a maximum uncompressed object size of 20 MB. For more
information, see [I'm having trouble copying and pasting](./client_troubleshooting.html#copy_paste).

###### Note

When copying from a Microsoft Office app, the clipboard only contains the last
copied item, and the item is converted into standard format. If you copy content
larger than 890 KB from a Microsoft Office app, the app might become slow or
unresponsive for up to 5 seconds.

## Manage hardware acceleration

Starting with version 5.0.0, hardware acceleration is enabled by default when you're
using the Amazon WorkSpaces Windows client application.

###### Note

If you plan to upgrade to a version between 3.1.4 and 5.0.0, and if you've
disabled hardware acceleration for version 3.1.3 or earlier by using the [procedure described later in this
section](#hardware_acceleration_313), make sure that you re-enable hardware acceleration in Windows by
setting the **DisableHWAcceleration** registry key to
`0`. Then you can upgrade to a version between 3.1.4 and
5.0.0 of the WorkSpaces Windows client application.

If you're experiencing high CPU usage or slower performance when using the client, you
might want to enable hardware acceleration in the client.

###### Note

If you enable hardware acceleration in the Windows client, the following issues
might occur with a few video driver versions:

* The screen might have flickering black boxes in some places.
* The screen might not properly update on the WorkSpaces login page, or it
  might not properly update after you log in to your WorkSpace. You might see
  artifacts on the screen.
* Your mouse clicks might not be lined up with the cursor position on the
  screen.

1. Choose **Settings**, **Manage Hardware
   Acceleration**.
2. In the **Manage Hardware Acceleration** dialog box,
   select **Enable Hardware Acceleration for Amazon
   WorkSpaces**, and then choose **Save**.
3. For this change to take effect, choose **Amazon
   WorkSpaces**, **Quit Amazon WorkSpaces**
   to close the Windows client application.
4. Restart the WorkSpaces Windows client application. Hardware
   acceleration should now be enabled.

## Diagnostic log upload

### Enabling diagnostic log uploads

To troubleshoot issues with the WorkSpaces client, you can enable diagnostic logging.
The log files that are sent to WorkSpaces include detailed information about your device
and connection to the AWS network. You can enable diagnostic log uploads before or
during WorkSpace streaming sessions so that these files are sent to WorkSpaces
automatically.

###### To send log files

###### Note

You can send log files before and during WorkSpaces streaming sessions.

1. Open your Amazon WorkSpaces client.
2. At the top of the WorkSpaces sign-in page, choose **Manage Diagnostic
   Logging Settings**.
3. In the pop-up dialog box, choose **Enable Diagnostic Logging for
   Amazon WorkSpaces** and click **Save**.

   ###### Important

   When you report an issue to AWS support, ensure you keep track of
   the device ID of the client who is experiencing the issue. This device
   ID can be found in the diagnostics logging menu, in the WorkSpaces client
   navigation bar, and it helps the support team identify logs associated
   with your specific device. Ensure you include the device ID in the
   tickets that you create regarding this specific issue.

# CVE-2021-38112: AWS WorkSpaces Remote Code Execution

David Yesland

## Introduction to CVE-2021-38112

This post details a vulnerability Rhino Security Labs discovered in the [AWS WorkSpaces desktop client](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/), tracked as CVE-2021-38112, which allows commands to be executed if a victim opens a malicious WorkSpaces URI from their browser. Rhino reported the vulnerability to Amazon and it was promptly patched. AWS WorkSpaces desktop client versions between 3.0.10 and 3.1.8 are affected by the vulnerability.

This AWS WorkSpaces vulnerability allows remote code execution on the operating system of the installed WorkSpace client. This vulnerability could also allow an attacker to potentially pivot into an AWS WorkSpaces host by configuring proxy settings in the WorkSpaces client itself or keylogging usernames and passwords when a victim legitimately accesses their WorkSpaces environment.

## What is Amazon WorkSpaces

WorkSpaces as described by Amazon:

*“Amazon WorkSpaces is a fully managed, persistent desktop virtualization service that enables your users to access the data, applications, and resources they need, anywhere, anytime, from any supported device. You can use Amazon WorkSpaces to provision either Windows or Linux desktops in just a few minutes and quickly scale to provide thousands of desktops to workers across the globe. Amazon WorkSpaces is deployed within an Amazon Virtual Private Cloud (VPC), and no user data is stored on the local device. This helps improve the security of user data and reduces your overall risk surface area.”*

There are a number of ways to access Amazon WorkSpaces, one of which is a [desktop client](https://clients.amazonworkspaces.com/) allowing you to connect directly to your WorkSpace. The desktop client conveniently registers a custom URI allowing users to quickly launch into a WorkSpace just by clicking a link in their browser.

## AWS Remote Code Execution Vulnerability: Technical Details

When the WorkSpaces desktop client is installed on a Windows machine, it registers a custom URI with the system (workspaces://). This allows WorkSpaces to be launched by visiting the custom URI in your browser. During the handling of the URI, the WorkSpaces application fails to sanitize the parameters which are later passed to the command line when authenticating to the WorkSpace. Since the WorkSpaces client is based on the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF) this allows arguments to be injected into the command line which abuse a known debugging CEF [command line argument (–gpu-launcher)](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#gpu-launcher), allowing arbitrary commands to be executed.

When a custom URI launches an application, the browser will pass the URI to the application on the command line as the first argument, the application can then handle the URI however it would like. In modern browsers command and argument injection is prevented at the initial launch of the application by URL encoding special characters in the URI, preventing things like double quotes or other command line control characters from being injected to break out of the intended command. The failure with Amazon WorkSpaces comes when WorkSpaces URL decodes and uses the parameters in the URI argument to launch a new command without sanitizing the parameters. At this point it is possible to inject arbitrary arguments.

![]( "1")

The UriSchemeGateway class from the decompiled WorkSpacesClient.Common.dll which handles the custom URI.

You can see that various parameters are parsed from the URI string such as the username, RegCode and host. Each parameter is then URL decoded using the Uri.UnescapeDataString method and then added to the startUpConfigDto object. The startUpConfigDto object is then passed to the ProcessStartUpConfigDto to start the process.

The only catch here is that during the startup process the RegCode parameter is validated to ensure it is a valid WorkSpaces registration code. But anyone with an AWS account can use their own valid WorkSpaces registration code to meet this requirement. To do this, you simply need to configure an AWS Managed Active Directory user and set up a WorkSpace for that user.

Forming a URI to execute commands is now fairly straightforward. Setup AWS WorkSpaces in your AWS account and grab a valid registration code for a user. Inject the [“–gpu-launcher”](https://peter.sh/experiments/chromium-command-line-switches/#gpu-launcher) argument specifying an arbitrary command which CEF will execute.

```
workspaces://anything%20--gpu-launcher=%22calc.exe%22@REGISTRATION_CODE

```

You can see in procmon there are two executions of workspaces.exe. The first one is the initial launch from the browser, the command line is as expected, URL encoded.

![]( "2")

Initial launch of WorkSpaces in Process Monitor.

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Amazon Web Services, Inc\Amazon WorkSpaces\workspaces.exe" --uri “workspaces://anything%20--gpu-launcher=%22calc.exe%22@REGISTRATION_CODE”

```

Then again, the workspaces.exe process is launched with additional arguments, including our injected ones which have been URL decoded.

![]( "3")

Secondary launch of WorkSpaces in Process Monitor.

```
"C:\Program Files (x86)\Amazon Web Services, Inc\Amazon WorkSpaces\workspaces.exe"  --ws-pipe-name UUID --ws-pipe-handle 4576 -r REGISTRATION_CODE --auth-url https://<appssite>.awsapps.com:443/login/?client_id=<clientid>&redirect_uri=https%3a%2f%2fskylight.local&locale=en_US --org-name <org name> --session-id <session id> --metricAppName Client -u anything --gpu-launcher="calc.exe" --login-mode 5

```

The GIF belows shows this all playout from opening a crafted page in a browser. Although by default a user needs to allow the WorkSpaces application to open from the browser, if the user had ever previously accepted this prompt to always allow this, this would require no user interaction.

AWS WorkSpaces RCE: Proof of Concept

## Conclusion

Custom URIs can be useful and are handy for users to make getting started in some applications easier on them. Although modern browsers do a better job of ensuring custom URIs are encoded before passing them to the command line to help prevent trivial argument and command injection, it is important to consider how those values are handled inside the rest of the application flow. The input is still untrusted and should be treated as such during use of the URI values.

As always, feel free to open issues and pull requests on GitHub if you’d like and we will try to get to them to support future usage of these tools. Follow us on Twitter for more releases and blog posts: @RhinoSecurity, @daveysec
