Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-38112:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of custom URI parameters within the AWS WorkSpaces desktop client. Specifically, when the client is launched via a custom URI (workspaces://), it fails to properly sanitize parameters extracted from the URI. These parameters are then passed to the command line during the authentication process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The core vulnerability is a command injection flaw. The WorkSpaces client uses the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF). By injecting a specific command line argument (`--gpu-launcher`) along with a malicious command, an attacker can achieve arbitrary code execution.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The WorkSpaces client does not sanitize parameters from the URI string. It URL-decodes them using `Uri.UnescapeDataString` and directly includes them in the command line arguments, making it vulnerable to command injection.
*   **Custom URI Handling:** The custom URI handler (`workspaces://`) is exploited. The browser passes the URI as an argument when launching the application. The client then improperly handles this URI and its parameters.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system where the vulnerable WorkSpaces client is installed.
*   **Potential for Lateral Movement:** An attacker might be able to pivot into the AWS WorkSpaces host by manipulating proxy settings within the client or by capturing credentials through keylogging during legitimate use.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious URI:** An attacker can craft a malicious URI that, when clicked by a victim, triggers the vulnerability. The URI would contain the `--gpu-launcher` argument with the attacker's chosen command.
*   **Browser Launch:** The vulnerability is triggered when the user's browser opens the crafted URI, launching the WorkSpaces application with the injected arguments.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Craft Malicious URI:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a URL with specific parameters to exploit the vulnerability.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to click the malicious URI. If a user previously accepted the browser prompt to always allow WorkSpaces links, no user interaction is required.
*   **Valid Workspaces Registration Code:** A valid WorkSpaces registration code is needed to bypass the registration code validation, this can be done using an AWS account and setting up a user with a WorkSpace.
*   **Understanding of CEF:** The attacker needs to be aware of the `--gpu-launcher` CEF command line argument to abuse the vulnerability.

**Versions Affected:**

*   AWS WorkSpaces desktop client versions between 3.0.10 and 3.1.8

**Mitigation:**

*   The vulnerability was patched in version 3.1.9 of the AWS WorkSpaces desktop client. Users should update to the latest version.
