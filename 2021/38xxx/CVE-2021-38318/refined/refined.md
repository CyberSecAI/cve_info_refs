**Affected Plugin:** 3D Cover Carousel

**Plugin Slug:** 3d-cover-carousel

**Affected Versions:** <= 1.0

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-38318

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to a reflected `$_SERVER["PHP_SELF"]` value in the ~/cover-carousel.php file. This means the plugin is using the unfiltered request URI which can allow an attacker to inject malicious code into it

- The use of an unfiltered `$_SERVER['PHP_SELF']` value in the  `~/cover-carousel.php` file

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts. When a victim visits a page with the injected script, the script will execute in their browser. This can lead to malicious actions on the site, such as stealing cookies or redirecting the user to another website.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious link that includes the malicious script in the `id` parameter and then tricking a user to click it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker does not need authentication. They need to be able to get a victim to visit a crafted link that includes the exploit.
