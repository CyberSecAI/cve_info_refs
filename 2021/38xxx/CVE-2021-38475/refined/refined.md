Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability related to CVE-2021-38475:

**Vulnerability:** Incorrect Permission Assignment for Critical Resource (CWE-732)

**Root Cause:** The database connection to the server is performed through a specific API call, which allows an unprivileged user to gain SYSDBA (system database administrator) permissions.

**Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in the fact that an unprivileged user can gain elevated privileges due to improper handling of permissions when connecting to the database using the specified API.

**Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain SYSDBA permissions. With these permissions, the attacker can potentially change user passwords or delete the database, which can lead to data breaches, system instability, and loss of availability.

**Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is network-based (AV:N) and has a low attack complexity (AC:L). It requires a low privilege level (PR:L) and user interaction is required (UI:R).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs network access to the affected system and a low-privileged user account. The attacker also needs to interact with the system to trigger the vulnerable API call.

**Additional Notes:** This vulnerability is present in AUVESY Versiondog versions prior to v8.0.
