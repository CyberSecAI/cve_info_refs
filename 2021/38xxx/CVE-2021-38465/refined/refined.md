{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The webinstaller, a Golang web server executable, does not limit the generation of installations, leading to uncontrolled resource consumption.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400)"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can cause resource exhaustion by generating a large number of installations, which are then saved without limitation in the temp folder of the webinstaller executable. This could potentially lead to a denial-of-service condition.",
    "attack_vectors": "Network-based, by sending requests to the webinstaller to generate installations.",
        "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs network access to the vulnerable service and the ability to send HTTP requests. User interaction is required (UI:R) because the attacker needs to initiate the generation of installations which are then saved in the temp directory."
