- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The PowerVM hypervisor can assign duplicate WWPNs (World Wide Port Names) to virtual fiber channel adapters in peer VMs after a specific series of service actions are performed.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Duplicate WWPNs assigned to virtual fiber channel adapters.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Potential issues with storage connectivity and data access due to WWPN conflicts.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation occurs via specific series of service actions on the PowerVM hypervisor.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**:  Attacker would need to be in a position to perform specific service actions on the hypervisor.
