## Description

The Online-Catering-Reservation-DT Food-Catering(by: oretnom23)v1.0 is vulnerable

in the application /catering/classes/Login.php which is redirected from /catering/dist/js/script.js app.

The SQL injection can be deployed by using the username vulnerable parameter on /catering/admin/login.php.

The parameter is not protected correctly, and there is no security escaping correctly to the MySQL query on /catering/classes/Login.php

when the user is sending fake information or malicious query payload to the database.

###### Technical Analysis

## Description:

The Online-Catering-Reservation-DT Food-Catering(by: oretnom23)v1.0 is vulnerable

in the application /catering/classes/Login.php which is called from /catering/dist/js/script.js app.

The parameter (username) from the login form is not protected correctly and there is no security and escaping from malicious payloads.

When the user is sending a request to the MySQL server he can bypass the login credentials and take control of the administer account.

## [README.MD](#readme)

## Base on checks for other issues for [CVE-2021-38758](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-38758) and I found SQL injection bypass login. :D

## Software version and [vendor](https://www.sourcecodester.com/php/14896/online-catering-reservation-system-using-php-free-source-code.html):

* + - Online-Catering-Reservation-DT Food Catering (by: oretnom23 ) v1.0
* Type `1=1`
* [+] [Proof](https://streamable.com/wpeumk)

---

[+] Vulnerable Code:

[+] Path: /catering/classes/Login.php

```
		$qry = $this->conn->query("SELECT * from users where username = '$username' and password = md5('$password') ");
		if($qry->num_rows > 0){
			foreach($qry->fetch_array() as $k => $v){
				if(!is_numeric($k) && $k != 'password'){
					$this->settings->set_userdata($k,$v);
				}

			}
```

[+] Temporary fix of the problem, but not strong: :)

```
		$qry = $this->conn->query("SELECT * from users where username = ('$username') and password = md5('$password') ");
		if($qry->num_rows > 0){
			foreach($qry->fetch_array() as $k => $v){
				if(!is_numeric($k) && $k != 'password'){
					$this->settings->set_userdata($k,$v);
				}

			}
```

## Description:

```
The Online-Catering-Reservation-DT Food-Catering(by: oretnom23)v1.0 is vulnerable
in the application /catering/classes/Login.php which is called from /catering/dist/js/script.js app.
The parameter (username) from the login form is not protected correctly and there is no security and escaping from malicious payloads.
When the user is sending a request to the MySQL server he can bypass the login credentials and take control of the administer account.
