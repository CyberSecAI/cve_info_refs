Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38268:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Incorrect default permissions setting in the Dynamic Data Mapping module.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
-  The Dynamic Data Mapping module in Liferay Portal versions 7.0.0 through 7.3.6 incorrectly sets default permissions for site members. This allows site members to add and duplicate forms, which they shouldn't have the ability to do.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Authenticated users with the "site member" role can add and duplicate forms via the UI or API. This could lead to unauthorized modification of the portal's functionality and potentially other malicious activities.

**Attack vectors:**
-  The vulnerability can be exploited through the user interface (UI) or the application programming interface (API) of the Liferay Portal.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be an authenticated user with the "site member" role within the Liferay portal.

**Affected versions:**
- Liferay Portal versions 7.0.0 through 7.3.6

**Fixed versions:**
- Liferay Portal 7.3.7
- August 2021 source patch for Liferay Portal 7.2.1

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Liferay Portal 7.3.7 or apply the August 2021 source patch for Liferay Portal 7.2.1.
- There is no fix for Liferay Portal 7.0 and 7.1; upgrading to 7.3 is recommended.
