- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper validation of user-supplied data during the parsing of EMF files in Microsoft Office Visio, leading to a write past the end of an allocated buffer.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Arbitrary code execution in the context of the current process.
- **Attack vectors**: Opening a malicious EMF file or visiting a malicious page.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to provide a malicious EMF file or have the victim visit a malicious page. User interaction is required to exploit the vulnerability.
