Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a SQL injection vulnerability in the login authentication process of the "Sureline_SUREedge_Migrator" platform.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the login form. Specifically, the application is not properly sanitizing user-supplied input within SQL queries, enabling an attacker to modify the intended query.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** By injecting SQL code into the password field, an attacker can bypass the authentication mechanism and gain administrative access to the platform, effectively allowing the attacker to receive all administration menus.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Form:** The primary attack vector is through the login screen where user input is not properly handled.
- **SQL Injection Payload:** The attacker uses a "skip" SQL query or a common bypass technique, like `1==1 --`,  in the password field.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the platform (remote access).
- **Basic understanding of SQL injection:**  The attacker needs basic knowledge of SQL syntax and common injection payloads such as the provided example `(or 1==1 --)`.
- **Web Browser:** Any of the tested browsers could be used(Safari, Chrome, and Firefox).
