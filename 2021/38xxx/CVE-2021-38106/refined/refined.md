- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A malformed PPT file leads to an out-of-bounds memory access due to an improper bounds check in the `UAX200.dll` library when decoding PPT files in Corel Presentations 2020.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Memory corruption vulnerability due to improper bounds checking, leading to out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can use out-of-bounds access for unintended reads, potentially leading to information leaks. An unauthenticated attacker can access unauthorized system memory within the context of the current user.
- **Attack vectors:** A crafted PPT file is used to trigger the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide a crafted PPT file to be opened by a user of Corel Presentations 2020. No authentication is needed.
