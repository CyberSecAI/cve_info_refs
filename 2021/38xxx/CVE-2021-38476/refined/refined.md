The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38476.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The InHand Networks IR615 Router's authentication process reveals if a username exists during the login attempt, which allows enumeration of user accounts.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Observable Response Discrepancy (CWE-204). The system gives different responses depending on whether the username exists or not.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can enumerate valid user accounts on the system. This information can be used in further attacks such as brute-forcing.

**Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** No special capabilities are required; an attacker needs to send login requests to the device over the network. The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
