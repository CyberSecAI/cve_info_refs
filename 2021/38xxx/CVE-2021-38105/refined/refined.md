- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is caused by a malformed PPT file, which leads to an out-of-bounds memory access due to an improper bounds check. The vulnerability exists in the 'IPPP82.FLT' plugin.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds memory access due to improper bounds checking when processing a malformed PPT file.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Attackers can exploit this vulnerability to read unauthorized system memory, potentially leading to information leaks.
- **Attack vectors**: A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious PPT file that triggers the out-of-bounds memory access when opened by a vulnerable application.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An unauthenticated attacker can exploit this vulnerability if the user opens a malicious PPT file.
