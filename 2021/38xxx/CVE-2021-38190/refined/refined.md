- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `Deserialize` implementation for `VecStorage` did not enforce the invariant that the number of elements must equal `nrows * ncols`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:  Improper input validation during deserialization of `VecStorage`, allowing for out-of-bounds memory access.
- **Impact of exploitation**:  Memory access beyond the allocated vector, leading to potential memory corruption or exposure.
- **Attack vectors**: Deserialization of specially crafted inputs.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide the crafted input that is deserialized by the vulnerable code.
