Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-38364, as described in the INTENDER paper:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause lies in the way ONOS (Open Network Operating System) handles intents, specifically `PointToPoint` intents. The system doesn't adequately compare flow rules installed by different intents that share the same path. This allows a subsequent intent with a similar path but a different destination to overwrite the existing flow rules.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Flow Rule Overwriting:** A key weakness is the ability of a new intent to overwrite the flow rules of an existing intent if they share the same path, but have different destination.
*   **Absence of Flow Rule Comparison:** There is a lack of proper comparison or conflict detection between flow rules associated with different intents, which leads to overwriting of configurations.
*   **Semantic Bug:** This is characterized as a "semantic bug" which means that the vulnerability is triggered not by a syntactic error in input data, but by flawed logic in how the system handles the semantics of intent configurations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Flow Manipulation:** An attacker can exploit this vulnerability to manipulate network traffic by installing a crafted intent, redirecting traffic to a different destination than intended by the original intent.
*   **Denial of Service:** By overwriting valid flow rules, an attacker can effectively cause a denial of service by disrupting network connectivity. This can prevent legitimate communication or services from working correctly.
*   **Network Traffic Redirection:** Malicious actors can redirect network traffic to unauthorized locations, potentially intercepting sensitive data or disrupting network operations.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Control Plane Access:** The attacker needs access to the control plane of the network, specifically to the intent framework of ONOS. This could be achieved through an authorized application, a REST client, or by exploiting other vulnerabilities.
*   **Intent Submission:** The attack is executed by submitting a crafted `PointToPoint` intent with a different destination that overlaps in path with another installed intent.
*   **Overwriting:** The crafted intent overwrites existing flow rules, causing the attack to be successful.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Control Plane Access:** The attacker must have the ability to submit intent requests to the ONOS controller, which requires access to the control plane APIs.
*   **Knowledge of Intent Framework:** The attacker needs a basic understanding of the intent framework in ONOS, specifically how to submit `PointToPoint` intents.
*   **Target Intent Knowledge:** The attacker must know about a victim `PointToPoint` intent path to make crafted intent overlap in path with that intent.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The provided information is more detailed than what is typically found in a CVE description.
*  This vulnerability is assigned the CVE ID **CVE-2021-38364**, and is referenced as **BUG 8** in the paper.
*   This is a type of semantic bug which cannot be easily found by existing tools.
