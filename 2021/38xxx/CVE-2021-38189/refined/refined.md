Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The `lettre` library's SMTP transport mechanism failed to properly handle a period (`.`) following a double CRLF sequence (`\r\n\r\n`) in the message body. The library incorrectly assumed that a single CRLF is sufficient to delimit the message body and did not account for the double CRLF sequence, which is the actual end-of-data marker for the DATA command in SMTP.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SMTP Command Injection:** By inserting `\r\n\r\n.\r\n` followed by arbitrary SMTP commands in the message body, an attacker could inject and execute commands other than those intended by the application using the library.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could potentially execute arbitrary SMTP commands on the mail server. This could allow actions like:
    - Modifying or deleting emails.
    - Sending unauthorized emails.
    - Potentially gaining access to the server or other accounts.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the message body of an email crafted by the attacker. The `lettre` library uses this message body as input to generate the SMTP data.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to control the message body being sent through the `lettre` library. This typically involves control over input to the email sending function.
- The attacker needs to be able to send an email through a system utilizing the vulnerable `lettre` library.

**Affected Functions:**
- `lettre::smtp::SmtpTransport::send`
- `lettre::transport::smtp::SmtpTransport::send`
- `lettre::transport::smtp::SmtpTransport::send_raw`

**Affected Versions:**
-  `< 0.10.0-alpha.1`
-  `>= 0.10.0-alpha.1, < 0.10.0-rc.3`
