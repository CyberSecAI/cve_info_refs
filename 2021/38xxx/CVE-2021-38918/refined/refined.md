- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A specific sequence of VM management operations from the management console (HMC, Novalink, or PowerVC) can lead to a violation of the isolation between peer VMs.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Violation of isolation between peer VMs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: A violation of the isolation between peer VMs, potentially allowing one VM to access or interfere with another.
- **Attack vectors**: A specific sequence of VM management operations initiated from the management console (HMC, Novalink, or PowerVC).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker would need to have the ability to initiate VM management operations through the management console (HMC, Novalink, or PowerVC).
