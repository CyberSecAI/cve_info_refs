Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described, which corresponds to CVE-2021-38346:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect authorization checks, stemming from a flawed implementation of `is_administrator` function.
- Unrestricted file upload functionality through the `brizy_create_block_screenshot` AJAX action.
- Lack of sanitization of uploaded filenames.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
1.  **Authorization Bypass:** The `is_administrator` function incorrectly granted administrative privileges to any logged-in user, regardless of their actual role. This is due to the function returning true if the user is logged in and accessing the `wp-admin` directory due to using `is_admin()` function for auth checks.
2.  **Unrestricted File Upload:** The `brizy_create_block_screenshot` AJAX action allows any logged-in user (due to the auth bypass) to upload files.
3.  **Path Traversal:** The `id` parameter, used for the file name, is not properly sanitized and can be manipulated to include `../` for path traversal.
4.  **Double Extension Attack:** The plugin appends `.jpg` to the uploaded file, but this can be bypassed to allow PHP execution, by providing file names such as `shell.php`.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
-   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading a PHP file with malicious code, an attacker can execute arbitrary code on the server, leading to complete site takeover.
-   **Site Takeover:** The attacker can gain full control over the WordPress site, including the ability to modify content, add administrative users, and more.

**Attack Vectors:**
-   **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending crafted HTTP requests to the WordPress site.
-   **AJAX Actions:** The `brizy_create_block_screenshot` AJAX action is used to upload the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-   **Authenticated User:** The attacker needs to have an account on the affected WordPress site, although even a subscriber-level account is sufficient due to the authorization bypass.
-   **Knowledge of the vulnerability**: The attacker must be aware of the vulnerable AJAX action and the ability to manipulate the filename using the `id` parameter and file content via the `ibsf` parameter.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was reintroduced after a previous patch in version 1.0.126, becoming active again in version 1.0.127
- The `ibsf` parameter takes base64-encoded data, which is then decoded and written to the file.
- The `id` parameter determines the filename.
- Double extension attack allows PHP code execution on vulnerable server configurations.
- Path traversal can bypass .htaccess execution restrictions.
