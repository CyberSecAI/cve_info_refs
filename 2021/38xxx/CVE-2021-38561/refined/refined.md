  "summary": "The provided content describes a commit that modifies the go text library to handle parsing panics gracefully by turning them into ErrSyntax errors. This change is related to preventing unexpected program termination due to parsing errors. Although not explicitly stated, this change could mitigate a potential denial-of-service vulnerability. The commit message indicates a pattern of new panics being found in the language parser.",
  "details": {
    "root_cause": "The root cause of this issue is the presence of panics within the language parser of the go text library. The parser was not robust enough to handle all types of malformed input, causing unexpected program termination.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper error handling in the language parser",
	  "Potential for Denial-of-Service via specially crafted input"
    ],
    "impact": "Prior to this fix, a specially crafted input could cause a panic, leading to a denial-of-service vulnerability. This commit mitigates this by converting panics into recoverable syntax errors, thereby preventing program termination.",
    "attack_vectors": [
	  "Malicious user provided input",
	  "Malformed data stream provided to the parser"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to provide input that triggers a panic in the language parser. This could be through a variety of ways such as a malformed Accept-Language header, or other input that is parsed by the library."
