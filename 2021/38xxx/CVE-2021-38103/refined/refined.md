*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:** Memory corruption due to out-of-bounds access.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** Attackers can use out-of-bounds access for unintended reads, writes, or frees, potentially leading to code corruption, control-flow hijack, or an information leak attack. Arbitrary code execution can occur within the context of the application.
*   **Attack vectors:** A crafted PPT file.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by enticing a user to open the crafted PPT file.
