  "cve": "CVE-2021-38377",
  "description": "HTML E-Mails with lots of content are being truncated for improved performance. Their full content is being delivered when opening the HTML part at a dedicated browser tab. The mechanism that dealt with temporary internal transformation state allowed to inject script code by abusing a \"anchor\" HTML comment. The comments identifier is a predictable UUID and stores HTML transformation results, which is exempt from sanitization.",
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability arises from the use of predictable UUIDs for anchor comments within truncated HTML emails. This predictable identifier stores HTML transformation results without sanitization.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)",
      "Improper Input Sanitization",
       "Predictable UUID Generation"
    ],
    "impact": "Malicious script code can be executed within a user's context, potentially leading to session hijacking or triggering unwanted actions via the web interface (e.g., redirecting to a third-party site).",
    "attack_vectors": "An attacker crafts a large HTML email containing malicious script code within an 'anchor' comment, then sends it to the victim. The victim must then open the full, non-truncated representation of the email for the exploit to be triggered.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to send emails to the victim and the victim needs to open the full HTML version of the email."
