- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Some containers within IBM Cloud Pak for Multicloud Management Monitoring were running in privileged mode, which granted excessive permissions.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Running containers in privileged mode allows for host information leakage or destruction if unauthorized access is gained and arbitrary commands are executed within the container.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker with unauthorized access to the vulnerable containers could potentially leak sensitive host information or cause destruction to the host system by executing arbitrary commands.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves gaining unauthorized access to the privileged containers.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to gain unauthorized access to the containers running in privileged mode to exploit the vulnerability.
