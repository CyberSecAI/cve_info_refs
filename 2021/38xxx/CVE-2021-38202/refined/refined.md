The provided content includes a commit message that directly addresses CVE-2021-38202:

   ```
   NFSD: Prevent a possible oops in the nfs\_dirent() tracepoint

   The double copy of the string is a mistake, plus __assign_str()
   uses strlen(), which is wrong to do on a string that isn't
   guaranteed to be NUL-terminated.

   Fixes: [6019ce0](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/6019ce0742ca55d3e45279a19b07d1542747a098) ("NFSD: Add a tracepoint to record directory entry encoding")

Additionally, the NetApp security advisory lists CVE-2021-38202 as one of the vulnerabilities in affected Linux Kernel versions. Therefore, this content is relevant.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

   *   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `nfsd_dirent()` tracepoint within the Linux kernel's Network File System daemon (NFSD). The code was making a double copy of a string, and `__assign_str()` was using `strlen()` on a string that was not guaranteed to be NULL-terminated.
   *   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
      *   **Double Copy:** The redundant string copy operation.
      *   **Incorrect String Handling:** The use of `strlen()` on a non-NULL terminated string, which could lead to out-of-bounds reads.
   *  **Impact of Exploitation:** A potential oops (kernel panic) could occur due to the out-of-bounds read by `strlen()`. This could lead to a denial of service condition. The code is located in the kernel's trace infrastructure which suggests it can only be triggered if the nfsd tracepoint is enabled.
   *   **Attack Vectors:**  An attacker would need to trigger the `nfsd_dirent` tracepoint with a specially crafted directory entry name that is not NULL-terminated to cause a denial of service.
   *   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to be able to trigger the `nfsd_dirent` tracepoint. This suggests a position with some level of access to the NFS server and the ability to interact with the directory enumeration process.

**3. Additional Information:**

*   The commit message explicitly mentions the fix, which involves removing the double copy and avoiding the use of `strlen()` on a possibly non-NULL terminated string.
*   The NetApp advisory indicates that multiple products that incorporate Linux Kernel versions prior to 5.13.4 are susceptible to this and other vulnerabilities. It assigns a CVSS v3.1 score of 7.5 (High) with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-38202 is a denial-of-service vulnerability in the Linux kernel's NFSD due to incorrect string handling in the `nfsd_dirent` tracepoint. An attacker with sufficient access to trigger the tracepoint could potentially cause a kernel panic by sending a crafted directory entry. The fix involves removing the double copy and avoiding the use of `strlen()`.
