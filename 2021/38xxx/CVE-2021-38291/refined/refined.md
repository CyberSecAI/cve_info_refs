Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38291:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is located in the `av_rescale_delta` function within `src/libavutil/mathematics.c`. Specifically, the assertion `duration >= 0` fails.
*   The root cause is that the function `get_audio_frame_duration()` can return a negative frame duration value in extreme cases, such as with ADPCM_MS samples having a very high channel count. This negative value leads to the assertion failure in `av_rescale_delta`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Assertion Failure**: The primary issue is the assertion failure within the `av_rescale_delta` function, which causes the program to abort.
*   **Negative Frame Duration:** The core weakness is that the audio frame duration calculation logic can return negative values in specific scenarios.
*   **Lack of Input Sanitization/Validation:** The code does not properly sanitize or validate the input `duration` which can lead to a crash.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** The assertion failure causes `ffmpeg` to abort, leading to a denial of service. This can disrupt processing of media files and potentially impact services that depend on `ffmpeg`.
*   **Program Crash:** The program terminates unexpectedly due to the assertion failure.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious Input File:** The attack vector is a specially crafted media file (e.g., an AVI file with ADPCM_MS audio) that triggers the negative duration calculation within `get_audio_frame_duration`.
*   **File Processing:** The vulnerability is triggered when `ffmpeg` attempts to process this crafted file via command line or a tool using the library.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a crafted input file to `ffmpeg`. This could be achieved via user upload, through network services where ffmpeg processes arbitrary files, or through a malicious website providing the malformed file for the user to download.
*   **No special privileges**: No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability, just a malformed input file.

**Additional Information:**

*   The `trac.ffmpeg.org` content provides a detailed analysis of the bug including the code location, how to reproduce the crash, the gdb output, and the commit that fixed the issue.
* The issue was discovered by 'dzj'.
*   The fix was implemented in commit [e01d306c647b5827102260b885faa223b646d2d1](https://git.ffmpeg.org/gitweb/ffmpeg.git/commit/e01d306c647b5827102260b885faa223b646d2d1).
