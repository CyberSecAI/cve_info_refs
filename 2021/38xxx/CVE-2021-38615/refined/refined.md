Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-38615:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   Lack of access control on the Single Sign-On (SSO) configuration endpoint.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The vulnerability stems from the failure to restrict access to the SSO configuration endpoint. This allows any authenticated user to interact with it.
*   **Information Exposure:**  Any logged-in user can view sensitive SSO configuration details.
*   **Unauthorized Modification:** Any logged-in user can modify SSO configuration data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Confidentiality Breach:** Unauthorized users can view potentially sensitive SSO configuration information.
*   **Integrity Violation:** Malicious users or those with incorrect permissions could modify the SSO settings.
*   **Service Disruption:** Unauthorized modification of the SSO configuration could disrupt the authentication process and impact system accessibility. This can be considered low impact on availability, as the attacker can not directly trigger a denial of service.
*   **Potential Privilege Escalation:** Though not directly stated as a vulnerability, it's possible that manipulation of SSO settings could indirectly lead to privilege escalation or bypasses to security controls, though this is not confirmed by the text and is speculative.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Network-Based Attack:** The vulnerability is accessible remotely over the network since it is a web based attack on the SSO configuration endpoint.
*   **Authentication Required:** Successful exploitation requires a valid login session from a low privileged user.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Authenticated User:** An attacker needs to have a valid user account on the system to exploit this vulnerability.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the vulnerable system over the network.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The affected software is "Eigen NLP" version 3.10.1.
*   The vendor was unresponsive to vulnerability reports.
*   CVSS v3.1 score is 6.3: AV:N/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:L
