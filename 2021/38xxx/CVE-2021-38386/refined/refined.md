- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The telnet server uses a fixed-length buffer to store responses to client commands (e.g., 'ls', 'help', 'write', 'append'). The server doesn't check if the buffer is full before writing to it.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Buffer overflow due to lack of size validation. The vulnerability is a classic buffer overflow.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Denial of Service (DoS). If the buffer overflows, the telnet server can become unable to send responses to clients, which can effectively result in a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**: Remote attackers can exploit the vulnerability. They can send commands that result in large responses, especially the 'ls' command, by writing many files into a single directory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to connect to the telnet server and execute commands that cause large server responses.
