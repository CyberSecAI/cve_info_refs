The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38449.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Some API functions in AUVESY Versiondog allow writing or copying data into a given buffer. Since the client controls these parameters, an attacker could rewrite the memory in any location of the affected product. This is a "write-what-where" condition.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Write-what-where condition (CWE-123). The vulnerability stems from insufficient control over parameters by API functions that permit writing data into arbitrary memory locations.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to achieve remote code execution and gain complete remote control over the machine.

**Attack vectors:** Network-based attacks exploiting the affected product's API functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable API functions of the AUVESY Versiondog software. No specific privileges or user interaction is required to trigger the vulnerability.
