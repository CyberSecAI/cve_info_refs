- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Missing HTTP Strict Transport Security (HSTS) header.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The absence of the HSTS header allows man-in-the-middle attacks to downgrade connections from HTTPS to HTTP.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to intercept and potentially modify communication between the user and the server.
- **Attack vectors**: Man-in-the-middle attacks.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be positioned in the network to intercept the communication between the user and the vulnerable server.
