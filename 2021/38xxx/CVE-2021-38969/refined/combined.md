## Workarounds and Mitigations

In order to exploit this vulnerability, an attacker would need to possess a valid set of credentials in the first place, which is unlikely as these can only be obtained by IBM support via a secure server which is used to generate the credentials. These servers are continuously updated with security patches in accordance with IBM's internal cybersecurity guidelines, and IBM is not aware of any security breaches.

Therefore, it is unlikely that this vulnerability can be exploited in practice, however to completely mitigate the risk IBM recommends one of two actions:

1. Upgrade to one of the fixed code levels listed above.
2. Disable the Remote Support feature.

The Remote Support feature is not enabled by default, so if you have not deliberately enabled this then you will not be vulnerable.

If you have enabled Remote Support, then this vulnerability can be mitigated by disabling it, either by running **chsra -disable** on the CLI or navigating to **System > Support > Support Assistance** in the management GUI.
