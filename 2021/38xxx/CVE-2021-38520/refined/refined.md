This document describes a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, identified as PSV-2018-0565, affecting several NETGEAR router models. Although it doesn't explicitly mention the CVE-2021-38520, it details a similar vulnerability and provides enough information to understand the weakness.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a command injection vulnerability that can be exploited after a user successfully authenticates to the router's web interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The web interface is vulnerable to command injection. This means an attacker can inject operating system commands that will be executed with the privileges of the web server process on the router.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The impact of successful exploitation is high, with the potential to achieve full system compromise. An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the router.
- This could lead to data theft, denial of service, or complete control over the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is over the network via the web interface of the router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log into the web interface of the affected router. This suggests the attacker needs to be either a legitimate user of the device, or they must have obtained valid credentials through another vulnerability or attack.
- The attacker must be on the same network as the router, or they must have network access to the router.

**Affected Products and Firmware:**

The following NETGEAR router models and firmware versions are affected:

*   R6400, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.52
*   R6400v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.84
*   R6700v3, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.84
*  R6700v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.62
*   R6900v2, running firmware versions prior to 1.2.0.62
*   R7000P, running firmware versions prior to 1.3.2.124

**Mitigation:**
The advisory recommends updating the router to the latest firmware versions to patch the vulnerability.

**CVSS:**
CVSS v3 Rating: Medium
CVSS v3 Score: 6.6
Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H
