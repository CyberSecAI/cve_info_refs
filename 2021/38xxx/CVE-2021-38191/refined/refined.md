Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38191:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from an incorrect implementation in `tokio::task::JoinHandle::abort`. When a task spawned on a `LocalSet` is aborted, and it's not currently executing, the task's future is dropped in the thread that calls `abort`, rather than on the thread associated with the `LocalSet`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Incorrect thread context for dropping futures:**  The core issue is that the cleanup/drop operation for the aborted task's future occurs in the wrong thread when using `LocalSet`. This violates the assumptions made by tasks designed to run within the context of a `LocalSet`.
- **Race Condition:** The incorrect dropping of the future can easily lead to race conditions, as many projects use non-`Send` types like `Rc` and `RefCell` within their Tokio tasks, relying on the single-threaded nature of the `LocalSet`. Dropping these resources in the wrong thread can cause memory corruption.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:** Due to the usage of non-`Send` types in many tokio tasks, dropping these in the wrong context can lead to memory corruption.
- **Undefined Behavior:** Dropping futures in the incorrect thread breaks the expected execution model and can lead to unpredictable program behavior, including crashes or incorrect results.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **`tokio::task::JoinHandle::abort` function:** The vulnerability is triggered by calling the `abort` method on a `JoinHandle` obtained from a task spawned on a `LocalSet`.
- **Task Abort:** An attacker only needs the capability to abort tasks running within a `LocalSet` in order to trigger the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the capability to call `JoinHandle::abort` on tasks spawned on a `LocalSet`.
- The attacker does not need any special access or privileges to trigger this vulnerability.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was patched in tokio versions: `>=1.5.1, <1.6.0`, `>=1.6.3, <1.7.0`, `>=1.7.2, <1.8.0`, and `>=1.8.1`.
- Versions of tokio `<0.3.0` are unaffected.
- The vulnerability is categorized under "memory-corruption" and involves a race condition, related to the usage of types such as `Rc` and `RefCell` which are not `Send`, which rely on being dropped in the correct thread.
- The vulnerability is tracked by the alias GHSA-2grh-hm3w-w7hv.
