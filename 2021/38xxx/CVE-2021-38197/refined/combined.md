| There is a vulnerability in unarr, which will lead to path traversal vulnerability Go unarr does not check the contents of the archive.  Exploit process   1. An attacker can construct a malicious tar package (or any compressed archive file).    As shown in the figure below, obviously, this will not succeed under the tar command, because the tar command fixes the vulnerability.    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76775664/128623491-2c9c8033-e8e6-48f1-b27f-cfecf9fcf532.png) 2. The victim uses go unarr to unzip the archive    As shown in the figure below, path traversal occurs during go unarr decompression, and we upload the file to the.. / directory    [image](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/76775664/128623566-23811330-64a6-448c-81b6-5d523d44b013.png) 3. By triggering the path traversal vulnerability, an attacker can store any file in any privileged place (which means that rce can be caused under root privileges) |
