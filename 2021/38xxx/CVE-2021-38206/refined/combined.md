usb: dwc3: core: fix kernel panic when do reboot
commit 4bf584a03eec674975ee9fe36c8583d9d470dab1 upstream.
When do system reboot, it calls dwc3\_shutdown and the whole debugfs
for dwc3 has removed first, when the gadget tries to do deinit, and
remove debugfs for its endpoints, it meets NULL pointer dereference
issue when call debugfs\_lookup. Fix it by removing the whole dwc3
debugfs later than dwc3\_drd\_exit.

usb: dwc3: debugfs: Add and remove endpoint dirs dynamically
commit 8d396bb0a5b62b326f6be7594d8bd46b088296bd upstream.
The DWC3 DebugFS directory and files are currently created once
during probe. This includes creation of subdirectories for each
of the gadget's endpoints. This works fine for peripheral-only
controllers, as dwc3\_core\_init\_mode() calls dwc3\_gadget\_init()
just prior to calling dwc3\_debugfs\_init().
However, for dual-role controllers, dwc3\_core\_init\_mode() will
instead call dwc3\_drd\_init() which is problematic in a few ways.
First, the initial state must be determined, then dwc3\_set\_mode()
will have to schedule drd\_work and by then dwc3\_debugfs\_init()
could have already been invoked. Even if the initial mode is
peripheral, dwc3\_gadget\_init() happens after the DebugFS files
are created, and worse so if the initial state is host and the
controller switches to peripheral much later. And secondly,
even if the gadget endpoints' debug entries were successfully
created, if the controller exits peripheral mode, its dwc3\_eps
are freed so the debug files would now hold stale references.
So it is best if the DebugFS endpoint entries are created and
removed dynamically at the same time the underlying dwc3\_eps are.
Do this by calling dwc3\_debugfs\_create\_endpoint\_dir() as each
endpoint is created, and conversely remove the DebugFS entry when
the endpoint is freed.

mm/slub: actually fix freelist pointer vs redzoning
commit e41a49fadbc80b60b48d3c095d9e2ee7ef7c9a8e upstream.
It turns out that SLUB redzoning ("slub\_debug=Z") checks from
s->object\_size rather than from s->inuse (which is normally bumped to
make room for the freelist pointer), so a cache created with an object
size less than 24 would have the freelist pointer written beyond
s->object\_size, causing the redzone to be corrupted by the freelist
pointer. This was very visible with "slub\_debug=ZF":

mm/slub: fix redzoning for small allocations
commit 74c1d3e081533825f2611e46edea1fcdc0701985 upstream.
The redzone area for SLUB exists between s->object\_size and s->inuse
(which is at least the word-aligned object\_size). If a cache were
created with an object\_size smaller than sizeof(void \*), the in-object
stored freelist pointer would overwrite the redzone (e.g. with boot
param "slub\_debug=ZF"):

Store the freelist pointer out of line when object\_size is smaller than
sizeof(void \*) and redzoning is enabled.
Additionally remove the "smaller than sizeof(void \*)" check under
CONFIG\_DEBUG\_VM in kmem\_cache\_sanity\_check() as it is now redundant:
SLAB and SLOB both handle small sizes.
(Note that no caches within this size range are known to exist in the

mm/slub: clarify verification reporting
commit 8669dbab2ae56085c128894b181c2aa50f97e368 upstream.
Patch series "Actually fix freelist pointer vs redzoning", v4.
This fixes redzoning vs the freelist pointer (both for middle-position
and very small caches). Both are "theoretical" fixes, in that I see no
evidence of such small-sized caches actually be used in the kernel, but
that's no reason to let the bugs continue to exist, especially since
people doing local development keep tripping over it. :)
This patch (of 3):
Instead of repeating "Redzone" and "Poison", clarify which sides of
those zones got tripped. Additionally fix column alignment in the
trailer.
Before:

mm/hugetlb: expand restore\_reserve\_on\_error functionality
commit 846be08578edb81f02bc8534577e6c367ef34f41 upstream.
The routine restore\_reserve\_on\_error is called to restore reservation
information when an error occurs after page allocation. The routine
alloc\_huge\_page modifies the mapping reserve map and potentially the
reserve count during allocation. If code calling alloc\_huge\_page
encounters an error after allocation and needs to free the page, the
reservation information needs to be adjusted.
Currently, restore\_reserve\_on\_error only takes action on pages for which
the reserve count was adjusted(HPageRestoreReserve flag). There is
nothing wrong with these adjustments. However, alloc\_huge\_page ALWAYS
modifies the reserve map during allocation even if the reserve count is
not adjusted. This can cause issues as observed during development of
this patch [1].
One specific series of operations causing an issue is:
- Create a shared hugetlb mapping
Reservations for all pages created by default
- Fault in a page in the mapping
Reservation exists so reservation count is decremented
- Punch a hole in the file/mapping at index previously faulted
Reservation and any associated pages will be removed
- Allocate a page to fill the hole
No reservation entry, so reserve count unmodified
Reservation entry added to map by alloc\_huge\_page
- Error after allocation and before instantiating the page
Reservation entry remains in map
- Allocate a page to fill the hole
Reservation entry exists, so decrement reservation count
This will cause a reservation count underflow as the reservation count
was decremented twice for the same index.
A user would observe a very large number for HugePages\_Rsvd in
/proc/meminfo. This would also likely cause subsequent allocations of
hugetlb pages to fail as it would 'appear' that all pages are reserved.
This sequence of operations is unlikely to happen, however they were
easily reproduced and observed using hacked up code as described in [1].
Address the issue by having the routine restore\_reserve\_on\_error take
action on pages where HPageRestoreReserve is not set. In this case, we
need to remove any reserve map entry created by alloc\_huge\_page. A new
helper routine vma\_del\_reservation assists with this operation.
There are three callers of alloc\_huge\_page which do not currently call
restore\_reserve\_on error before freeing a page on error paths. Add
those missing calls.

mm/swap: fix pte\_same\_as\_swp() not removing uffd-wp bit when compare
commit 099dd6878b9b12d6bbfa6bf29ce0c8ddd38f6901 upstream.
I found it by pure code review, that pte\_same\_as\_swp() of unuse\_vma()
didn't take uffd-wp bit into account when comparing ptes.
pte\_same\_as\_swp() returning false negative could cause failure to
swapoff swap ptes that was wr-protected by userfaultfd.

mm,hwpoison: fix race with hugetlb page allocation
commit 25182f05ffed0b45602438693e4eed5d7f3ebadd upstream.
When hugetlb page fault (under overcommitting situation) and
memory\_failure() race, VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE() is triggered by the following
race:
CPU0: CPU1:
gather\_surplus\_pages()
page = alloc\_surplus\_huge\_page()
memory\_failure\_hugetlb()
get\_hwpoison\_page(page)
\_\_get\_hwpoison\_page(page)
get\_page\_unless\_zero(page)
zero = put\_page\_testzero(page)
VM\_BUG\_ON\_PAGE(!zero, page)
enqueue\_huge\_page(h, page)
put\_page(page)
\_\_get\_hwpoison\_page() only checks the page refcount before taking an
additional one for memory error handling, which is not enough because
there's a time window where compound pages have non-zero refcount during
hugetlb page initialization.
So make \_\_get\_hwpoison\_page() check page status a bit more for hugetlb
pages with get\_hwpoison\_huge\_page(). Checking hugetlb-specific flags
under hugetlb\_lock makes sure that the hugetlb page is not transitive.
It's notable that another new function, HWPoisonHandlable(), is helpful
to prevent a race against other transitive page states (like a generic
compound page just before PageHuge becomes true).

net: bridge: fix vlan tunnel dst refcnt when egressing
commit cfc579f9d89af4ada58c69b03bcaa4887840f3b3 upstream.
The egress tunnel code uses dst\_clone() and directly sets the result
which is wrong because the entry might have 0 refcnt or be already deleted,
causing number of problems. It also triggers the WARN\_ON() in dst\_hold()[1]
when a refcnt couldn't be taken. Fix it by using dst\_hold\_safe() and
checking if a reference was actually taken before setting the dst.

net: bridge: fix vlan tunnel dst null pointer dereference
commit 58e2071742e38f29f051b709a5cca014ba51166f upstream.
This patch fixes a tunnel\_dst null pointer dereference due to lockless
access in the tunnel egress path. When deleting a vlan tunnel the
tunnel\_dst pointer is set to NULL without waiting a grace period (i.e.
while it's still usable) and packets egressing are dereferencing it
without checking. Use READ/WRITE\_ONCE to annotate the lockless use of
tunnel\_id, use RCU for accessing tunnel\_dst and make sure it is read
only once and checked in the egress path. The dst is already properly RCU
protected so we don't need to do anything fancy than to make sure
tunnel\_id and tunnel\_dst are read only once and checked in the egress path.

net: ll\_temac: Make sure to free skb when it is completely used
commit 6aa32217a9a446275440ee8724b1ecaf1838df47 upstream.
With the skb pointer piggy-backed on the TX BD, we have a simple and
efficient way to free the skb buffer when the frame has been transmitted.
But in order to avoid freeing the skb while there are still fragments from
the skb in use, we need to piggy-back on the TX BD of the skb, not the
first.
Without this, we are doing use-after-free on the DMA side, when the first
BD of a multi TX BD packet is seen as completed in xmit\_done, and the
remaining BDs are still being processed.

commit 0288e5e16a2e18f0b7e61a2b70d9037fc6e4abeb upstream.
If cfg80211\_pmsr\_process\_abort() moves all the PMSR requests that

As a result, it is possible that cfg80211\_pmsr\_complete() will run in

Fix it by freeing the request in cfg80211\_pmsr\_complete() only if it
is still in the original pmsr list.

When I moved around the code here, I neglected that we could still
call register\_netdev() or similar without the wiphy mutex held,
which then calls cfg80211\_register\_wdev() - that's also done from
cfg80211\_register\_netdevice(), but the phy80211 symlink creation
was only there. Now, the symlink isn't needed for a \*pure\* wdev,
but a netdev not registered via cfg80211\_register\_wdev() should
still have the symlink, so move the creation to the right place.

mac80211: Fix NULL ptr deref for injected rate info
commit bddc0c411a45d3718ac535a070f349be8eca8d48 upstream.
The commit cb17ed29a7a5 ("mac80211: parse radiotap header when selecting Tx
queue") moved the code to validate the radiotap header from
ieee80211\_monitor\_start\_xmit to ieee80211\_parse\_tx\_radiotap. This made is
possible to share more code with the new Tx queue selection code for
injected frames. But at the same time, it now required the call of
ieee80211\_parse\_tx\_radiotap at the beginning of functions which wanted to
handle the radiotap header. And this broke the rate parser for radiotap
header parser.
The radiotap parser for rates is operating most of the time only on the
data in the actual radiotap header. But for the 802.11a/b/g rates, it must
also know the selected band from the chandef information. But this
information is only written to the ieee80211\_tx\_info at the end of the
ieee80211\_monitor\_start\_xmit - long after ieee80211\_parse\_tx\_radiotap was
already called. The info->band information was therefore always 0
(NL80211\_BAND\_2GHZ) when the parser code tried to access it.
For a 5GHz only device, injecting a frame with 802.11a rates would cause a
NULL pointer dereference because local->hw.wiphy->bands[NL80211\_BAND\_2GHZ]
would most likely have been NULL when the radiotap parser searched for the
correct rate index of the driver.

mac80211: fix deadlock in AP/VLAN handling
commit d5befb224edbe53056c2c18999d630dafb4a08b9 upstream.
Syzbot reports that when you have AP\_VLAN interfaces that are up
and close the AP interface they belong to, we get a deadlock. No
surprise - since we dev\_close() them with the wiphy mutex held,
which goes back into the netdev notifier in cfg80211 and tries to
acquire the wiphy mutex there.
To fix this, we need to do two things:
1) prevent changing iftype while AP\_VLANs are up, we can't
easily fix this case since cfg80211 already calls us with
the wiphy mutex held, but change\_interface() is relatively
rare in drivers anyway, so changing iftype isn't used much
(and userspace has to fall back to down/change/up anyway)
2) pull the dev\_close() loop over VLANs out of the wiphy mutex
section in the normal stop case

crash\_core, vmcoreinfo: append 'SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS' to vmcoreinfo
commit 4f5aecdff25f59fb5ea456d5152a913906ecf287 upstream.
As mentioned in kernel commit 1d50e5d0c505 ("crash\_core, vmcoreinfo:
Append 'MAX\_PHYSMEM\_BITS' to vmcoreinfo"), SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS in the
formula:
#define SECTIONS\_SHIFT (MAX\_PHYSMEM\_BITS - SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS)
Besides SECTIONS\_SHIFT, SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS is also used to calculate
PAGES\_PER\_SECTION in makedumpfile just like kernel.
Unfortunately, this arch-dependent macro SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS changes, e.g.
recently in kernel commit f0b13ee23241 ("arm64/sparsemem: reduce
SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS"). But user space wants a stable interface to get
this info. Such info is impossible to be deduced from a crashdump
vmcore. Hence append SECTION\_SIZE\_BITS to vmcoreinfo.

x86/fpu: Invalidate FPU state after a failed XRSTOR from a user buffer
commit d8778e393afa421f1f117471144f8ce6deb6953a upstream.
Both Intel and AMD consider it to be architecturally valid for XRSTOR to
fail with #PF but nonetheless change the register state. The actual
conditions under which this might occur are unclear [1], but it seems
plausible that this might be triggered if one sibling thread unmaps a page
and invalidates the shared TLB while another sibling thread is executing
XRSTOR on the page in question.
\_\_fpu\_\_restore\_sig() can execute XRSTOR while the hardware registers
are preserved on behalf of a different victim task (using the
fpu\_fpregs\_owner\_ctx mechanism), and, in theory, XRSTOR could fail but
modify the registers.
If this happens, then there is a window in which \_\_fpu\_\_restore\_sig()
could schedule out and the victim task could schedule back in without
reloading its own FPU registers. This would result in part of the FPU
state that \_\_fpu\_\_restore\_sig() was attempting to load leaking into the
victim task's user-visible state.
Invalidate preserved FPU registers on XRSTOR failure to prevent this
situation from corrupting any state.
[1] Frequent readers of the errata lists might imagine "complex
microarchitectural conditions".

x86/fpu: Prevent state corruption in \_\_fpu\_\_restore\_sig()
commit 484cea4f362e1eeb5c869abbfb5f90eae6421b38 upstream.
The non-compacted slowpath uses \_\_copy\_from\_user() and copies the entire
user buffer into the kernel buffer, verbatim. This means that the kernel
buffer may now contain entirely invalid state on which XRSTOR will #GP.
validate\_user\_xstate\_header() can detect some of that corruption, but that
leaves the onus on callers to clear the buffer.
Prior to XSAVES support, it was possible just to reinitialize the buffer,
completely, but with supervisor states that is not longer possible as the
buffer clearing code split got it backwards. Fixing that is possible but
not corrupting the state in the first place is more robust.
Avoid corruption of the kernel XSAVE buffer by using copy\_user\_to\_xstate()
which validates the XSAVE header contents before copying the actual states
to the kernel. copy\_user\_to\_xstate() was previously only called for
compacted-format kernel buffers, but it works for both compacted and
non-compacted forms.
Using it for the non-compacted form is slower because of multiple
\_\_copy\_from\_user() operations, but that cost is less important than robust
code in an already slow path.

x86/pkru: Write hardware init value to PKRU when xstate is init
commit 510b80a6a0f1a0d114c6e33bcea64747d127973c upstream.
When user space brings PKRU into init state, then the kernel handling is
broken:
T1 user space
xsave(state)
state.header.xfeatures &= ~XFEATURE\_MASK\_PKRU;
xrstor(state)
T1 -> kernel
schedule()
XSAVE(S) -> T1->xsave.header.xfeatures[PKRU] == 0
T1->flags |= TIF\_NEED\_FPU\_LOAD;
wrpkru();
schedule()
...
pk = get\_xsave\_addr(&T1->fpu->state.xsave, XFEATURE\_PKRU);
if (pk)
wrpkru(pk->pkru);
else
wrpkru(DEFAULT\_PKRU);
Because the xfeatures bit is 0 and therefore the value in the xsave
storage is not valid, get\_xsave\_addr() returns NULL and switch\_to()
writes the default PKRU. -> FAIL #1!
So that wrecks any copy\_to/from\_user() on the way back to user space
which hits memory which is protected by the default PKRU value.
Assumed that this does not fail (pure luck) then T1 goes back to user
space and because TIF\_NEED\_FPU\_LOAD is set it ends up in
switch\_fpu\_return()
\_\_fpregs\_load\_activate()
if (!fpregs\_state\_valid()) {
load\_XSTATE\_from\_task();
}
But if nothing touched the FPU between T1 scheduling out and back in,
then the fpregs\_state is still valid which means switch\_fpu\_return()
does nothing and just clears TIF\_NEED\_FPU\_LOAD. Back to user space with
DEFAULT\_PKRU loaded. -> FAIL #2!
The fix is simple: if get\_xsave\_addr() returns NULL then set the
PKRU value to 0 instead of the restrictive default PKRU value in
init\_pkru\_value.

x86/ioremap: Map EFI-reserved memory as encrypted for SEV
commit 8d651ee9c71bb12fc0c8eb2786b66cbe5aa3e43b upstream.
Some drivers require memory that is marked as EFI boot services
data. In order for this memory to not be re-used by the kernel
after ExitBootServices(), efi\_mem\_reserve() is used to preserve it
by inserting a new EFI memory descriptor and marking it with the
EFI\_MEMORY\_RUNTIME attribute.
Under SEV, memory marked with the EFI\_MEMORY\_RUNTIME attribute needs to
be mapped encrypted by Linux, otherwise the kernel might crash at boot
like below:

x86/mm: Avoid truncating memblocks for SGX memory
commit 28e5e44aa3f4e0e0370864ed008fb5e2d85f4dc8 upstream.
tl;dr:
Several SGX users reported seeing the following message on NUMA systems:
sgx: [Firmware Bug]: Unable to map EPC section to online node. Fallback to the NUMA node 0.
This turned out to be the memblock code mistakenly throwing away SGX
memory.
=== Full Changelog ===
The 'max\_pfn' variable represents the highest known RAM address. It can
be used, for instance, to quickly determine for which physical addresses
there is mem\_map[] space allocated. The numa\_meminfo code makes an
effort to throw out ("trim") all memory blocks which are above 'max\_pfn'.
SGX memory is not considered RAM (it is marked as "Reserved" in the
e820) and is not taken into account by max\_pfn. Despite this, SGX memory
areas have NUMA affinity and are enumerated in the ACPI SRAT table. The
existing SGX code uses the numa\_meminfo mechanism to look up the NUMA
affinity for its memory areas.
In cases where SGX memory was above max\_pfn (usually just the one EPC
section in the last highest NUMA node), the numa\_memblock is truncated
at 'max\_pfn', which is below the SGX memory. When the SGX code tries to
look up the affinity of this memory, it fails and produces an error message:
sgx: [Firmware Bug]: Unable to map EPC section to online node. Fallback to the NUMA node 0.
and assigns the memory to NUMA node 0.
Instead of silently truncating the memory block at 'max\_pfn' and
dropping the SGX memory, add the truncated portion to
'numa\_reserved\_meminfo'. This allows the SGX code to later determine
the NUMA affinity of its 'Reserved' area.
Before, numa\_meminfo looked like this (from 'crash'):
blk = { start = 0x0, end = 0x2080000000, nid = 0x0 }
{ start = 0x2080000000, end = 0x4000000000, nid = 0x1 }
numa\_reserved\_meminfo is empty.
With this, numa\_meminfo looks like this:
blk = { start = 0x0, end = 0x2080000000, nid = 0x0 }
{ start = 0x2080000000, end = 0x4000000000, nid = 0x1 }
and numa\_reserved\_meminfo has an entry for node 1's SGX memory:
blk = { start = 0x4000000000, end = 0x4080000000, nid = 0x1 }

ARCv2: save ABI registers across signal handling
commit 96f1b00138cb8f04c742c82d0a7c460b2202e887 upstream.
ARCv2 has some configuration dependent registers (r30, r58, r59) which
could be targetted by the compiler. To keep the ABI stable, these were
unconditionally part of the glibc ABI
(sysdeps/unix/sysv/linux/arc/sys/ucontext.h:mcontext\_t) however we
missed populating them (by saving/restoring them across signal
handling).
This patch fixes the issue by
- adding arcv2 ABI regs to kernel struct sigcontext
- populating them during signal handling
Change to struct sigcontext might seem like a glibc ABI change (although
it primarily uses ucontext\_t:mcontext\_t) but the fact is
- it has only been extended (existing fields are not touched)
- the old sigcontext was ABI incomplete to begin with anyways

s390/ap: Fix hanging ioctl caused by wrong msg counter
commit e73a99f3287a740a07d6618e9470f4d6cb217da8 upstream.
When a AP queue is switched to soft offline, all pending
requests are purged out of the pending requests list and
'received' by the upper layer like zcrypt device drivers.
This is also done for requests which are already enqueued
into the firmware queue. A request in a firmware queue
may eventually produce an response message, but there is
no waiting process any more. However, the response was
counted with the queue\_counter and as this counter was
reset to 0 with the offline switch, the pending response
caused the queue\_counter to get negative. The next request
increased this counter to 0 (instead of 1) which caused
the ap code to assume there is nothing to receive and so
the response for this valid request was never tried to
fetch from the firmware queue.
This all caused a queue to not work properly after a
switch offline/online and in the end processes to hang
forever when trying to send a crypto request after an
queue offline/online switch cicle.
Fixed by a) making sure the counter does not drop below 0
and b) on a successful enqueue of a message has at least
a value of 1.
Additionally a warning is emitted, when a reply can't get
assigned to a waiting process. This may be normal operation
(process had timeout or has been killed) but may give a
hint that something unexpected happened (like this odd
behavior described above).

that aren't handled by kvm\_calc\_mmu\_role\_common(). While the nested MMU
isn't used for shadow paging, things like the number of levels in the
guest's page tables are surprisingly important when walking the guest
page tables. Failure to reinitialize the nested MMU context if L2's
paging mode changes can result in unexpected and/or missed page faults,
and likely other explosions.
E.g. if an L1 vCPU is running both a 32-bit PAE L2 and a 64-bit L2, the
"common" role calculation will yield the same role for both L2s. If the
64-bit L2 is run after the 32-bit PAE L2, L0 will fail to reinitialize
the nested MMU context, ultimately resulting in a bad walk of L2's page
tables as the MMU will still have a guest root\_level of PT32E\_ROOT\_LEVEL.

KVM: x86: Immediately reset the MMU context when the SMM flag is cleared
commit 78fcb2c91adfec8ce3a2ba6b4d0dda89f2f4a7c6 upstream.
Immediately reset the MMU context when the vCPU's SMM flag is cleared so
that the SMM flag in the MMU role is always synchronized with the vCPU's
flag. If RSM fails (which isn't correctly emulated), KVM will bail
without calling post\_leave\_smm() and leave the MMU in a bad state.
The bad MMU role can lead to a NULL pointer dereference when grabbing a
shadow page's rmap for a page fault as the initial lookups for the gfn
will happen with the vCPU's SMM flag (=0), whereas the rmap lookup will
use the shadow page's SMM flag, which comes from the MMU (=1). SMM has
an entirely different set of memslots, and so the initial lookup can find
a memslot (SMM=0) and then explode on the rmap memslot lookup (SMM=1).

btrfs: zoned: fix negative space\_info->bytes\_readonly
commit f9f28e5bd0baee9708c9011897196f06ae3a2733 upstream.
Consider we have a using block group on zoned btrfs.
|<- ZU ->|<- used ->|<---free--->|
`- Alloc offset
ZU: Zone unusable
Marking the block group read-only will migrate the zone unusable bytes
to the read-only bytes. So, we will have this.
|<- RO ->|<- used ->|<--- RO --->|
RO: Read only
When marking it back to read-write, btrfs\_dec\_block\_group\_ro()
subtracts the above "RO" bytes from the
space\_info->bytes\_readonly. And, it moves the zone unusable bytes back
and again subtracts those bytes from the space\_info->bytes\_readonly,
leading to negative bytes\_readonly.
This can be observed in the output as eg.:
Data, single: total=512.00MiB, used=165.21MiB, zone\_unusable=16.00EiB
Data, single: total=536870912, used=173256704, zone\_unusable=18446744073603186688
This commit fixes the issue by reordering the operations.

PCI: Work around Huawei Intelligent NIC VF FLR erratum
commit ce00322c2365e1f7b0312f2f493539c833465d97 upstream.
pcie\_flr() starts a Function Level Reset (FLR), waits 100ms (the maximum
time allowed for FLR completion by PCIe r5.0, sec 6.6.2), and waits for the
FLR to complete. It assumes the FLR is complete when a config read returns
valid data.
When we do an FLR on several Huawei Intelligent NIC VFs at the same time,
firmware on the NIC processes them serially. The VF may respond to config
reads before the firmware has completed its reset processing. If we bind a
driver to the VF (e.g., by assigning the VF to a virtual machine) in the
interval between the successful config read and completion of the firmware
reset processing, the NIC VF driver may fail to load.
Prevent this driver failure by waiting for the NIC firmware to complete its
reset processing. Not all NIC firmware supports this feature.

commit db2f77e2bd99dbd2fb23ddde58f0fae392fe3338 upstream.
The Broadcom BCM57414 NIC may be a multi-function device. While it does
not advertise an ACS capability, peer-to-peer transactions are not possible
between the individual functions, so it is safe to treat them as fully
isolated.
Add an ACS quirk for this device so the functions can be in independent
IOMMU groups and attached individually to userspace applications using
VFIO.

PCI: aardvark: Fix kernel panic during PIO transfer
commit f18139966d072dab8e4398c95ce955a9742e04f7 upstream.
Trying to start a new PIO transfer by writing value 0 in PIO\_START register
when previous transfer has not yet completed (which is indicated by value 1
in PIO\_START) causes an External Abort on CPU, which results in kernel
panic:
SError Interrupt on CPU0, code 0xbf000002 -- SError
Kernel panic - not syncing: Asynchronous SError Interrupt
To prevent kernel panic, it is required to reject a new PIO transfer when
previous one has not finished yet.
If previous PIO transfer is not finished yet, the kernel may issue a new
PIO request only if the previous PIO transfer timed out.
In the past the root cause of this issue was incorrectly identified (as it
often happens during link retraining or after link down event) and special
hack was implemented in Trusted Firmware to catch all SError events in EL3,
to ignore errors with code 0xbf000002 and not forwarding any other errors
to kernel and instead throw panic from EL3 Trusted Firmware handler.
Links to discussion and patches about this issue:
https://git.trustedfirmware.org/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a.git/commit/?id=3c7dcdac5c50
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/20190316161243.29517-1-repk@triplefau.lt/
https://lore.kernel.org/linux-pci/971be151d24312cc533989a64bd454b4@www.loen.fr/
https://review.trustedfirmware.org/c/TF-A/trusted-firmware-a/+/1541
But the real cause was the fact that during link retraining or after link
down event the PIO transfer may take longer time, up to the 1.44s until it
times out. This increased probability that a new PIO transfer would be
issued by kernel while previous one has not finished yet.
After applying this change into the kernel, it is possible to revert the
mentioned TF-A hack and SError events do not have to be caught in TF-A EL3.

tracing: Do no increment trace\_clock\_global() by one
commit 89529d8b8f8daf92d9979382b8d2eb39966846ea upstream.
The trace\_clock\_global() tries to make sure the events between CPUs is
somewhat in order. A global value is used and updated by the latest read
of a clock. If one CPU is ahead by a little, and is read by another CPU, a
lock is taken, and if the timestamp of the other CPU is behind, it will
simply use the other CPUs timestamp.
The lock is also only taken with a "trylock" due to tracing, and strange
recursions can happen. The lock is not taken at all in NMI context.
In the case where the lock is not able to be taken, the non synced
timestamp is returned. But it will not be less than the saved global
timestamp.
The problem arises because when the time goes "backwards" the time
returned is the saved timestamp plus 1. If the lock is not taken, and the
plus one to the timestamp is returned, there's a small race that can cause
the time to go backwards!
CPU0 CPU1
---- ----
trace\_clock\_global() {
ts = clock() [ 1000 ]
trylock(clock\_lock) [ success ]
global\_ts = ts; [ 1000 ]
trace\_clock\_global() {
ts = clock() [ 999 ]
if (ts < global\_ts)
ts = global\_ts + 1 [ 1001 ]
trylock(clock\_lock) [ fail ]
return ts [ 1001]
}
unlock(clock\_lock);
return ts; [ 1000 ]
}
trace\_clock\_global() {
ts = clock() [ 1000 ]
if (ts < global\_ts) [ false 1000 == 1000 ]
trylock(clock\_lock) [ success ]
global\_ts = ts; [ 1000 ]
unlock(clock\_lock)
return ts; [ 1000 ]
}
The above case shows to reads of trace\_clock\_global() on the same CPU, but
the second read returns one less than the first read. That is, time when
backwards, and this is not what is allowed by trace\_clock\_global().
This was triggered by heavy tracing and the ring buffer checker that tests
for the clock going backwards:

tracing: Do not stop recording comms if the trace file is being read
commit 4fdd595e4f9a1ff6d93ec702eaecae451cfc6591 upstream.
A while ago, when the "trace" file was opened, tracing was stopped, and
code was added to stop recording the comms to saved\_cmdlines, for mapping
of the pids to the task name.
Code has been added that only records the comm if a trace event occurred,
and there's no reason to not trace it if the trace file is opened.

tracing: Do not stop recording cmdlines when tracing is off
commit 85550c83da421fb12dc1816c45012e1e638d2b38 upstream.
The saved\_cmdlines is used to map pids to the task name, such that the
output of the tracing does not just show pids, but also gives a human
readable name for the task.
If the name is not mapped, the output looks like this:
<...>-1316 [005] ...2 132.044039: ...
Instead of this:
gnome-shell-1316 [005] ...2 132.044039: ...
The names are updated when tracing is running, but are skipped if tracing
is stopped. Unfortunately, this stops the recording of the names if the
top level tracer is stopped, and not if there's other tracers active.
The recording of a name only happens when a new event is written into a
ring buffer, so there is no need to test if tracing is on or not. If
tracing is off, then no event is written and no need to test if tracing is
off or not.
Remove the check, as it hides the names of tasks for events in the
instance buffers.

usb: chipidea: imx: Fix Battery Charger 1.2 CDP detection
commit c6d580d96f140596d69220f60ce0cfbea4ee5c0f upstream.
i.MX8MM cannot detect certain CDP USB HUBs. usbmisc\_imx.c driver is not
following CDP timing requirements defined by USB BC 1.2 specification
and section 3.2.4 Detection Timing CDP.
During Primary Detection the i.MX device should turn on VDP\_SRC and
IDM\_SINK for a minimum of 40ms (TVDPSRC\_ON). After a time of TVDPSRC\_ON,
the i.MX is allowed to check the status of the D- line. Current
implementation is waiting between 1ms and 2ms, and certain BC 1.2
complaint USB HUBs cannot be detected. Increase delay to 40ms allowing
enough time for primary detection.
During secondary detection the i.MX is required to disable VDP\_SRC and
IDM\_SNK, and enable VDM\_SRC and IDP\_SINK for at least 40ms (TVDMSRC\_ON).
Current implementation is not disabling VDP\_SRC and IDM\_SNK, introduce
disable sequence in imx7d\_charger\_secondary\_detection() function.
VDM\_SRC and IDP\_SINK should be enabled for at least 40ms (TVDMSRC\_ON).
Increase delay allowing enough time for detection.

usb: core: hub: Disable autosuspend for Cypress CY7C65632
commit a7d8d1c7a7f73e780aa9ae74926ae5985b2f895f upstream.
The Cypress CY7C65632 appears to have an issue with auto suspend and
detecting devices, not too dissimilar to the SMSC 5534B hub. It is
easiest to reproduce by connecting multiple mass storage devices to
the hub at the same time. On a Lenovo Yoga, around 1 in 3 attempts
result in the devices not being detected. It is however possible to
make them appear using lsusb -v.
Disabling autosuspend for this hub resolves the issue.

can: mcba\_usb: fix memory leak in mcba\_usb
commit 91c02557174be7f72e46ed7311e3bea1939840b0 upstream.
Syzbot reported memory leak in SocketCAN driver for Microchip CAN BUS
Analyzer Tool. The problem was in unfreed usb\_coherent.
In mcba\_usb\_start() 20 coherent buffers are allocated and there is
nothing, that frees them:
1) In callback function the urb is resubmitted and that's all
2) In disconnect function urbs are simply killed, but URB\_FREE\_BUFFER
is not set (see mcba\_usb\_start) and this flag cannot be used with
coherent buffers.
Fail log:
| [ 1354.053291][ T8413] mcba\_usb 1-1:0.0 can0: device disconnected
| [ 1367.059384][ T8420] kmemleak: 20 new suspected memory leaks (see /sys/kernel/debug/kmem)
So, all allocated buffers should be freed with usb\_free\_coherent()
explicitly
NOTE:
The same pattern for allocating and freeing coherent buffers
is used in drivers/net/can/usb/kvaser\_usb/kvaser\_usb\_core.c

The error code is not set at all in the sys event iter function.
This may lead to an uninitialized value of "ret" in
metricgroup\_\_add\_metric() when no CPU metric is added.
Fix by properly setting the error code.
It is not necessary to init "ret" to 0 in metricgroup\_\_add\_metric(), as
if we have no CPU or sys event metric matching, then "has\_match" should
be 0 and "ret" is set to -EINVAL.
However gcc cannot detect that it may not have been set after the
map\_for\_each\_metric() loop for CPU metrics, which is strange.

perf metricgroup: Fix find\_evsel\_group() event selector
[ Upstream commit fc96ec4d5d4155c61cbafd49fb2dd403c899a9f4 ]
The following command segfaults on my x86 broadwell:
$ ./perf stat -M frontend\_bound,retiring,backend\_bound,bad\_speculation sleep 1
WARNING: grouped events cpus do not match, disabling group:
anon group { raw 0x10e }
anon group { raw 0x10e }
perf: util/evsel.c:1596: get\_group\_fd: Assertion `!(!leader->core.fd)' failed.
Aborted (core dumped)
The issue shows itself as a use-after-free in evlist\_\_check\_cpu\_maps(),
whereby the leader of an event selector (evsel) has been deleted (yet we
still attempt to verify for an evsel).
Fundamentally the problem comes from metricgroup\_\_setup\_events() ->
find\_evsel\_group(), and has developed from the previous fix attempt in
commit 9c880c24cb0d ("perf metricgroup: Fix for metrics containing
duration\_time").
The problem now is that the logic in checking if an evsel is in the same
group is subtly broken for the "cycles" event. For the "cycles" event,
the pmu\_name is NULL; however the logic in find\_evsel\_group() may set an
event matched against "cycles" as used, when it should not be.
This leads to a condition where an evsel is set, yet its leader is not.
Fix the check for evsel pmu\_name by not matching evsels when either has a
NULL pmu\_name.
There is still a pre-existing metric issue whereby the ordering of the
metrics may break the 'stat' function, as discussed at:

irqchip/gic-v3: Workaround inconsistent PMR setting on NMI entry
[ Upstream commit 382e6e177bc1c02473e56591fe5083ae1e4904f6 ]
The arm64 entry code suffers from an annoying issue on taking
a NMI, as it sets PMR to a value that actually allows IRQs
to be acknowledged. This is done for consistency with other parts
of the code, and is in the process of being fixed. This shouldn't
be a problem, as we are not enabling interrupts whilst in NMI
context.
However, in the infortunate scenario that we took a spurious NMI
(retired before the read of IAR) \*and\* that there is an IRQ pending
at the same time, we'll ack the IRQ in NMI context. Too bad.
In order to avoid deadlocks while running something like perf,
teach the GICv3 driver about this situation: if we were in
a context where no interrupt should have fired, transiently
set PMR to a value that only allows NMIs before acking the pending
interrupt, and restore the original value after that.
This papers over the core issue for the time being, and makes
NMIs great again. Sort of.

mm: relocate 'write\_protect\_seq' in struct mm\_struct
[ Upstream commit 2e3025434a6ba090c85871a1d4080ff784109e1f ]
0day robot reported a 9.2% regression for will-it-scale mmap1 test
case[1], caused by commit 57efa1fe5957 ("mm/gup: prevent gup\_fast from
racing with COW during fork").
Further debug shows the regression is due to that commit changes the
offset of hot fields 'mmap\_lock' inside structure 'mm\_struct', thus some
cache alignment changes.
From the perf data, the contention for 'mmap\_lock' is very severe and
takes around 95% cpu cycles, and it is a rw\_semaphore
struct rw\_semaphore {
atomic\_long\_t count; /\* 8 bytes \*/
atomic\_long\_t owner; /\* 8 bytes \*/
struct optimistic\_spin\_queue osq; /\* spinner MCS lock \*/
...
Before commit 57efa1fe5957 adds the 'write\_protect\_seq', it happens to
have a very optimal cache alignment layout, as Linus explained:
"and before the addition of the 'write\_protect\_seq' field, the
mmap\_sem was at offset 120 in 'struct mm\_struct'.
Which meant that count and owner were in two different cachelines,
and then when you have contention and spend time in
rwsem\_down\_write\_slowpath(), this is probably \*exactly\* the kind
of layout you want.
Because first the rwsem\_write\_trylock() will do a cmpxchg on the
first cacheline (for the optimistic fast-path), and then in the
case of contention, rwsem\_down\_write\_slowpath() will just access
the second cacheline.
Which is probably just optimal for a load that spends a lot of
time contended - new waiters touch that first cacheline, and then
they queue themselves up on the second cacheline."
After the commit, the rw\_semaphore is at offset 128, which means the
'count' and 'owner' fields are now in the same cacheline, and causes
more cache bouncing.
Currently there are 3 "#ifdef CONFIG\_XXX" before 'mmap\_lock' which will
affect its offset:
CONFIG\_MMU
CONFIG\_MEMBARRIER
CONFIG\_HAVE\_ARCH\_COMPAT\_MMAP\_BASES
The layout above is on 64 bits system with 0day's default kernel config
(similar to RHEL-8.3's config), in which all these 3 options are 'y'.
And the layout can vary with different kernel configs.
Relayouting a structure is usually a double-edged sword, as sometimes it
can helps one case, but hurt other cases. For this case, one solution
is, as the newly added 'write\_protect\_seq' is a 4 bytes long seqcount\_t
(when CONFIG\_DEBUG\_LOCK\_ALLOC=n), placing it into an existing 4 bytes
hole in 'mm\_struct' will not change other fields' alignment, while
restoring the regression.

drm/sun4i: dw-hdmi: Make HDMI PHY into a platform device
[ Upstream commit 9bf3797796f570b34438235a6a537df85832bdad ]
On sunxi boards that use HDMI output, HDMI device probe keeps being
avoided indefinitely with these repeated messages in dmesg:
platform 1ee0000.hdmi: probe deferral - supplier 1ef0000.hdmi-phy
not ready
There's a fwnode\_link being created with fw\_devlink=on between hdmi
and hdmi-phy nodes, because both nodes have 'compatible' property set.
Fw\_devlink code assumes that nodes that have compatible property
set will also have a device associated with them by some driver
eventually. This is not the case with the current sun8i-hdmi
driver.
This commit makes sun8i-hdmi-phy into a proper platform device
and fixes the display pipeline probe on sunxi boards that use HDMI.

In 'rt2880\_pmx\_group\_enable' driver is printing an error and returning

icmp: don't send out ICMP messages with a source address of 0.0.0.0
[ Upstream commit 321827477360934dc040e9d3c626bf1de6c3ab3c ]
When constructing ICMP response messages, the kernel will try to pick a
suitable source address for the outgoing packet. However, if no IPv4
addresses are configured on the system at all, this will fail and we end up
producing an ICMP message with a source address of 0.0.0.0. This can happen
on a box routing IPv4 traffic via v6 nexthops, for instance.
Since 0.0.0.0 is not generally routable on the internet, there's a good
chance that such ICMP messages will never make it back to the sender of the
original packet that the ICMP message was sent in response to. This, in
turn, can create connectivity and PMTUd problems for senders. Fortunately,
RFC7600 reserves a dummy address to be used as a source for ICMP
messages (192.0.0.8/32), so let's teach the kernel to substitute that
address as a last resort if the regular source address selection procedure
fails.
Below is a quick example reproducing this issue with network namespaces:
ip netns add ns0
ip l add type veth peer netns ns0
ip l set dev veth0 up
ip a add 10.0.0.1/24 dev veth0
ip a add fc00:dead:cafe:42::1/64 dev veth0
ip r add 10.1.0.0/24 via inet6 fc00:dead:cafe:42::2
ip -n ns0 l set dev veth0 up
ip -n ns0 a add fc00:dead:cafe:42::2/64 dev veth0
ip -n ns0 r add 10.0.0.0/24 via inet6 fc00:dead:cafe:42::1
ip netns exec ns0 sysctl -w net.ipv4.icmp\_ratelimit=0
ip netns exec ns0 sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip\_forward=1
tcpdump -tpni veth0 -c 2 icmp &
ping -w 1 10.1.0.1 > /dev/null
tcpdump: verbose output suppressed, use -v[v]... for full protocol decode
listening on veth0, link-type EN10MB (Ethernet), snapshot length 262144 bytes
IP 10.0.0.1 > 10.1.0.1: ICMP echo request, id 29, seq 1, length 64
IP 0.0.0.0 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP net 10.1.0.1 unreachable, length 92
2 packets captured
2 packets received by filter
0 packets dropped by kernel
With this patch the above capture changes to:

IP 192.0.0.8 > 10.0.0.1: ICMP net 10.1.0.1 unreachable, length 92

net: hamradio: fix memory leak in mkiss\_close
[ Upstream commit 7edcc682301492380fbdd604b4516af5ae667a13 ]
My local syzbot instance hit memory leak in
mkiss\_open()[1]. The problem was in missing
free\_netdev() in mkiss\_close().
In mkiss\_open() netdevice is allocated and then
registered, but in mkiss\_close() netdevice was
only unregistered, but not freed.
Fail log:

net/mlx5: Reset mkey index on creation
[ Upstream commit 0232fc2ddcf4ffe01069fd1aa07922652120f44a ]
Reset only the index part of the mkey and keep the variant part. On
devlink reload, driver recreates mkeys, so the mkey index may change.
Trying to preserve the variant part of the mkey, driver mistakenly
merged the mkey index with current value. In case of a devlink reload,
current value of index part is dirty, so the index may be corrupted.

net/mlx5e: Don't create devices during unload flow
[ Upstream commit a5ae8fc9058e37437c8c1f82b3d412b4abd1b9e6 ]
Running devlink reload command for port in switchdev mode cause
resources to corrupt: driver can't release allocated EQ and reclaim
memory pages, because "rdma" auxiliary device had add CQs which blocks
EQ from deletion.
Erroneous sequence happens during reload-down phase, and is following:
1. detach device - suspends auxiliary devices which support it, destroys
others. During this step "eth-rep" and "rdma-rep" are destroyed,
"eth" - suspended.
2. disable SRIOV - moves device to legacy mode; as part of disablement -
rescans drivers. This step adds "rdma" auxiliary device.
3. destroy EQ table - .
Driver shouldn't create any device during unload flows. To handle that
implement MLX5\_PRIV\_FLAGS\_DETACH flag, set it on device detach and unset
on device attach. If flag is set do no-op on drivers rescan.

net/mlx5: DR, Fix STEv1 incorrect L3 decapsulation padding
[ Upstream commit 65fb7d109abe3a1a9f1c2d3ba7e1249bc978d5f0 ]
Decapsulation L3 on small inner packets which are less than
64 Bytes was done incorrectly. In small packets there is an
extra padding added in L2 which should not be included in L3
length. The issue was that after decapL3 the extra L2 padding
caused an update on the L3 length.
To avoid this issue the new header is pushed to the beginning
of the packet (offset 0) which should not cause a HW reparse
and update the L3 length.

In commit 24803f38a5c0 ("igmp: do not remove igmp souce list info when set
link down"), the ip\_mc\_clear\_src() in ip\_mc\_destroy\_dev() was removed,
because it was also called in igmpv3\_clear\_delrec().
Rough callgraph:
inetdev\_destroy
-> ip\_mc\_destroy\_dev
-> igmpv3\_clear\_delrec
-> ip\_mc\_clear\_src
-> RCU\_INIT\_POINTER(dev->ip\_ptr, NULL)
However, ip\_mc\_clear\_src() called in igmpv3\_clear\_delrec() doesn't
release in\_dev->mc\_list->sources. And RCU\_INIT\_POINTER() assigns the
NULL to dev->ip\_ptr. As a result, in\_dev cannot be obtained through
inetdev\_by\_index() and then in\_dev->mc\_list->sources cannot be released
by ip\_mc\_del1\_src() in the sock\_close. Rough call sequence goes like:
sock\_close
-> \_\_sock\_release
-> inet\_release
-> ip\_mc\_drop\_socket
-> inetdev\_by\_index
-> ip\_mc\_leave\_src
-> ip\_mc\_del\_src
-> ip\_mc\_del1\_src
So we still need to call ip\_mc\_clear\_src() in ip\_mc\_destroy\_dev() to free
in\_dev->mc\_list->sources.

net: cdc\_ncm: switch to eth%d interface naming
[ Upstream commit c1a3d4067309451e68c33dbd356032549cc0bd8e ]
This is meant to make the host side cdc\_ncm interface consistently
named just like the older CDC protocols: cdc\_ether & cdc\_ecm
(and even rndis\_host), which all use 'FLAG\_ETHER | FLAG\_POINTTOPOINT'.
include/linux/usb/usbnet.h:
#define FLAG\_ETHER 0x0020 /\* maybe use "eth%d" names \*/
#define FLAG\_WLAN 0x0080 /\* use "wlan%d" names \*/
#define FLAG\_WWAN 0x0400 /\* use "wwan%d" names \*/
#define FLAG\_POINTTOPOINT 0x1000 /\* possibly use "usb%d" names \*/
drivers/net/usb/usbnet.c @ line 1711:
strcpy (net->name, "usb%d");
...
// heuristic: "usb%d" for links we know are two-host,
// else "eth%d" when there's reasonable doubt. userspace
// can rename the link if it knows better.
if ((dev->driver\_info->flags & FLAG\_ETHER) != 0 &&
((dev->driver\_info->flags & FLAG\_POINTTOPOINT) == 0 ||
(net->dev\_addr [0] & 0x02) == 0))
strcpy (net->name, "eth%d");
/\* WLAN devices should always be named "wlan%d" \*/
if ((dev->driver\_info->flags & FLAG\_WLAN) != 0)
strcpy(net->name, "wlan%d");
/\* WWAN devices should always be named "wwan%d" \*/
if ((dev->driver\_info->flags & FLAG\_WWAN) != 0)
strcpy(net->name, "wwan%d");
So by using ETHER | POINTTOPOINT the interface naming is
either usb%d or eth%d based on the global uniqueness of the
mac address of the device.
Without this 2.5gbps ethernet dongles which all seem to use the cdc\_ncm
driver end up being called usb%d instead of eth%d even though they're
definitely not two-host. (All 1gbps & 5gbps ethernet usb dongles I've
tested don't hit this problem due to use of different drivers, primarily
r8152 and aqc111)
Fixes tag is based purely on git blame, and is really just here to make
sure this hits LTS branches newer than v4.5.

ptp: improve max\_adj check against unreasonable values
[ Upstream commit 475b92f932168a78da8109acd10bfb7578b8f2bb ]
Scaled PPM conversion to PPB may (on 64bit systems) result
in a value larger than s32 can hold (freq/scaled\_ppm is a long).
This means the kernel will not correctly reject unreasonably
high ->freq values (e.g. > 4294967295ppb, 281474976645 scaled PPM).
The conversion is equivalent to a division by ~66 (65.536),
so the value of ppb is always smaller than ppm, but not small
enough to assume narrowing the type from long -> s32 is okay.
Note that reasonable user space (e.g. ptp4l) will not use such
high values, anyway, 4289046510ppb ~= 4.3x, so the fix is
somewhat pedantic.

bpf: Fix leakage under speculation on mispredicted branches
[ Upstream commit 9183671af6dbf60a1219371d4ed73e23f43b49db ]
The verifier only enumerates valid control-flow paths and skips paths that
are unreachable in the non-speculative domain. And so it can miss issues
under speculative execution on mispredicted branches.
For example, a type confusion has been demonstrated with the following
crafted program:
// r0 = pointer to a map array entry
// r6 = pointer to readable stack slot
// r9 = scalar controlled by attacker
1: r0 = \*(u64 \*)(r0) // cache miss
2: if r0 != 0x0 goto line 4
3: r6 = r9
4: if r0 != 0x1 goto line 6
5: r9 = \*(u8 \*)(r6)
6: // leak r9
Since line 3 runs iff r0 == 0 and line 5 runs iff r0 == 1, the verifier
concludes that the pointer dereference on line 5 is safe. But: if the
attacker trains both the branches to fall-through, such that the following
is speculatively executed ...
r6 = r9
r9 = \*(u8 \*)(r6)
// leak r9
... then the program will dereference an attacker-controlled value and could
leak its content under speculative execution via side-channel. This requires
to mistrain the branch predictor, which can be rather tricky, because the
branches are mutually exclusive. However such training can be done at
congruent addresses in user space using different branches that are not
mutually exclusive. That is, by training branches in user space ...
A: if r0 != 0x0 goto line C
B: ...
C: if r0 != 0x0 goto line D
D: ...
... such that addresses A and C collide to the same CPU branch prediction
entries in the PHT (pattern history table) as those of the BPF program's
lines 2 and 4, respectively. A non-privileged attacker could simply brute
force such collisions in the PHT until observing the attack succeeding.
Alternative methods to mistrain the branch predictor are also possible that
avoid brute forcing the collisions in the PHT. A reliable attack has been
demonstrated, for example, using the following crafted program:
// r0 = pointer to a [control] map array entry
// r7 = \*(u64 \*)(r0 + 0), training/attack phase
// r8 = \*(u64 \*)(r0 + 8), oob address
// [...]
// r0 = pointer to a [data] map array entry
1: if r7 == 0x3 goto line 3
2: r8 = r0
// crafted sequence of conditional jumps to separate the conditional
// branch in line 193 from the current execution flow
3: if r0 != 0x0 goto line 5
4: if r0 == 0x0 goto exit
5: if r0 != 0x0 goto line 7
6: if r0 == 0x0 goto exit
[...]
187: if r0 != 0x0 goto line 189
188: if r0 == 0x0 goto exit
// load any slowly-loaded value (due to cache miss in phase 3) ...
189: r3 = \*(u64 \*)(r0 + 0x1200)
// ... and turn it into known zero for verifier, while preserving slowly-
// loaded dependency when executing:
190: r3 &= 1
191: r3 &= 2
// speculatively bypassed phase dependency
192: r7 += r3
193: if r7 == 0x3 goto exit
194: r4 = \*(u8 \*)(r8 + 0)
// leak r4
As can be seen, in training phase (phase != 0x3), the condition in line 1
turns into false and therefore r8 with the oob address is overridden with
the valid map value address, which in line 194 we can read out without
issues. However, in attack phase, line 2 is skipped, and due to the cache
miss in line 189 where the map value is (zeroed and later) added to the
phase register, the condition in line 193 takes the fall-through path due
to prior branch predictor training, where under speculation, it'll load the
byte at oob address r8 (unknown scalar type at that point) which could then
be leaked via side-channel.
One way to mitigate these is to 'branch off' an unreachable path, meaning,
the current verification path keeps following the is\_branch\_taken() path
and we push the other branch to the verification stack. Given this is
unreachable from the non-speculative domain, this branch's vstate is
explicitly marked as speculative. This is needed for two reasons: i) if
this path is solely seen from speculative execution, then we later on still
want the dead code elimination to kick in in order to sanitize these
instructions with jmp-1s, and ii) to ensure that paths walked in the
non-speculative domain are not pruned from earlier walks of paths walked in
the speculative domain. Additionally, for robustness, we mark the registers
which have been part of the conditional as unknown in the speculative path
given there should be no assumptions made on their content.
The fix in here mitigates type confusion attacks described earlier due to
i) all code paths in the BPF program being explored and ii) existing
verifier logic already ensuring that given memory access instruction
references one specific data structure.
An alternative to this fix that has also been looked at in this scope was to
mark aux->alu\_state at the jump instruction with a BPF\_JMP\_TAKEN state as
well as direction encoding (always-goto, always-fallthrough, unknown), such
that mixing of different always-\* directions themselves as well as mixing of
always-\* with unknown directions would cause a program rejection by the
verifier, e.g. programs with constructs like 'if ([...]) { x = 0; } else
{ x = 1; }' with subsequent 'if (x == 1) { [...] }'. For unprivileged, this
would result in only single direction always-\* taken paths, and unknown taken
paths being allowed, such that the former could be patched from a conditional
jump to an unconditional jump (ja). Compared to this approach here, it would
have two downsides: i) valid programs that otherwise are not performing any
pointer arithmetic, etc, would potentially be rejected/broken, and ii) we are
required to turn off path pruning for unprivileged, where both can be avoided
in this work through pushing the invalid branch to the verification stack.
The issue was originally discovered by Adam and Ofek, and later independently
discovered and reported as a result of Benedict and Piotr's research work.

ipv4: Fix device used for dst\_alloc with local routes
[ Upstream commit b87b04f5019e821c8c6c7761f258402e43500a1f ]
Oliver reported a use case where deleting a VRF device can hang
waiting for the refcnt to drop to 0. The root cause is that the dst
is allocated against the VRF device but cached on the loopback
device.
The use case (added to the selftests) has an implicit VRF crossing
due to the ordering of the FIB rules (lookup local is before the
l3mdev rule, but the problem occurs even if the FIB rules are
re-ordered with local after l3mdev because the VRF table does not
have a default route to terminate the lookup). The end result is
is that the FIB lookup returns the loopback device as the nexthop,
but the ingress device is in a VRF. The mismatch causes the dst
alloc against the VRF device but then cached on the loopback.
The fix is to bring the trick used for IPv6 (see ip6\_rt\_get\_dev\_rcu):
pick the dst alloc device based the fib lookup result but with checks
that the result has a nexthop device (e.g., not an unreachable or
prohibit entry).

calculated message payload length (684) not sufficient
WARNING: CPU: 0 PID: 30967 at net/ethtool/netlink.c:369 ethnl\_default\_doit+0x87a/0xa20
and a splat.
As usually with such warnings three conditions must be met for the warning
to trigger:
- there must be no skb size rounding up (e.g. reply\_size of 684);
- string set must be per-device (so that the header gets populated);
- the device name must be at least 12 characters long.
all in all with current user space it looks like reading priv flags
is the only place this could potentially happen. Or with syzbot :)

net: qualcomm: rmnet: don't over-count statistics
[ Upstream commit 994c393bb6886d6d94d628475b274a8cb3fc67a4 ]
The purpose of the loop using u64\_stats\_fetch\_\*\_irq() is to ensure
statistics on a given CPU are collected atomically. If one of the
statistics values gets updated within the begin/retry window, the
loop will run again.
Currently the statistics totals are updated inside that window.
This means that if the loop ever retries, the statistics for the
CPU will be counted more than once.
Fix this by taking a snapshot of a CPU's statistics inside the
protected window, and then updating the counters with the snapshot
values after exiting the loop.
(Also add a newline at the end of this file...)

The calling function - mptcp\_subflow\_data\_available() - can be invoked
from different contexts:
- plain ssk socket lock
- ssk socket lock + mptcp\_data\_lock
- ssk socket lock + mptcp\_data\_lock + msk socket lock.
Since subflow\_error\_report() tries to acquire the mptcp\_data\_lock, the
latter two call chains will cause soft lookup.
This change addresses the issue moving the error reporting call to
outer functions, where the held locks list is known and the we can
acquire only the needed one.

mptcp: wake-up readers only for in sequence data
[ Upstream commit 99d1055ce2469dca3dd14be0991ff8133e25e3d0 ]
Currently we rely on the subflow->data\_avail field, which is subject to
races:
ssk1
skb len = 500 DSS(seq=1, len=1000, off=0)
# data\_avail == MPTCP\_SUBFLOW\_DATA\_AVAIL
ssk2
skb len = 500 DSS(seq = 501, len=1000)
# data\_avail == MPTCP\_SUBFLOW\_DATA\_AVAIL
ssk1
skb len = 500 DSS(seq = 1, len=1000, off =500)
# still data\_avail == MPTCP\_SUBFLOW\_DATA\_AVAIL,
# as the skb is covered by a pre-existing map,
# which was in-sequence at reception time.
Instead we can explicitly check if some has been received in-sequence,
propagating the info from \_\_mptcp\_move\_skbs\_from\_subflow().
Additionally add the 'ONCE' annotation to the 'data\_avail' memory
access, as msk will read it outside the subflow socket lock.

sch\_cake: Fix out of bounds when parsing TCP options and header
[ Upstream commit ba91c49dedbde758ba0b72f57ac90b06ddf8e548 ]
The TCP option parser in cake qdisc (cake\_get\_tcpopt and
cake\_tcph\_may\_drop) could read one byte out of bounds. When the length
is 1, the execution flow gets into the loop, reads one byte of the
opcode, and if the opcode is neither TCPOPT\_EOL nor TCPOPT\_NOP, it reads
one more byte, which exceeds the length of 1.
This fix is inspired by commit 9609dad263f8 ("ipv4: tcp\_input: fix stack
out of bounds when parsing TCP options.").
v2 changes:
Added doff validation in cake\_get\_tcphdr to avoid parsing garbage as TCP
header. Although it wasn't strictly an out-of-bounds access (memory was
allocated), garbage values could be read where CAKE expected the TCP
header if doff was smaller than 5.

net/mlx5e: Remove dependency in IPsec initialization flows
[ Upstream commit 8ad893e516a77209a1818a2072d2027d87db809f ]
Currently, IPsec feature is disabled because mlx5e\_build\_nic\_netdev
is required to be called after mlx5e\_ipsec\_init. This requirement is
invalid as mlx5e\_build\_nic\_netdev and mlx5e\_ipsec\_init initialize
independent resources.
Remove ipsec pointer check in mlx5e\_build\_nic\_netdev so that the
two functions can be called at any order.

Most of the necessary logic is already correctly implemented by
mlx5e\_get\_next\_valid\_encap() helper that is used in neigh stats update
handler. Make the handler generic by renaming it to
mlx5e\_get\_next\_matching\_encap() and use callback to test whether flow is
matching instead of hardcoded check for 'valid' flag value. Implement
mlx5e\_get\_next\_valid\_encap() by calling mlx5e\_get\_next\_matching\_encap()
with callback that tests encap MLX5\_ENCAP\_ENTRY\_VALID flag. Implement new
mlx5e\_get\_next\_init\_encap() helper by calling
mlx5e\_get\_next\_matching\_encap() with callback that tests encap completion
result to be non-error and use it in mlx5e\_rep\_neigh\_update() to safely
iterate over nhe->encap\_list.
Remove encap completion logic from mlx5e\_rep\_update\_flows() since the encap

rtnetlink: Fix regression in bridge VLAN configuration
[ Upstream commit d2e381c4963663bca6f30c3b996fa4dbafe8fcb5 ]
Cited commit started returning errors when notification info is not
filled by the bridge driver, resulting in the following regression:
# ip link add name br1 type bridge vlan\_filtering 1
# bridge vlan add dev br1 vid 555 self pvid untagged
RTNETLINK answers: Invalid argument
As long as the bridge driver does not fill notification info for the
bridge device itself, an empty notification should not be considered as
an error. This is explained in commit 59ccaaaa49b5 ("bridge: dont send
notification when skb->len == 0 in rtnl\_bridge\_notify").
Fix by removing the error and add a comment to avoid future bugs.

udp: fix race between close() and udp\_abort()
[ Upstream commit a8b897c7bcd47f4147d066e22cc01d1026d7640e ]
Kaustubh reported and diagnosed a panic in udp\_lib\_lookup().
The root cause is udp\_abort() racing with close(). Both
racing functions acquire the socket lock, but udp{v6}\_destroy\_sock()
release it before performing destructive actions.
We can't easily extend the socket lock scope to avoid the race,
instead use the SOCK\_DEAD flag to prevent udp\_abort from doing
any action when the critical race happens.

ice: parameterize functions responsible for Tx ring management
[ Upstream commit 2e84f6b3773f43263124c76499c0c4ec3f40aa9b ]
Commit ae15e0ba1b33 ("ice: Change number of XDP Tx queues to match
number of Rx queues") tried to address the incorrect setting of XDP
queue count that was based on the Tx queue count, whereas in theory we
should provide the XDP queue per Rx queue. However, the routines that
setup and destroy the set of Tx resources are still based on the
vsi->num\_txq.
Ice supports the asynchronous Tx/Rx queue count, so for a setup where
vsi->num\_txq > vsi->num\_rxq, ice\_vsi\_stop\_tx\_rings and ice\_vsi\_cfg\_txqs
will be accessing the vsi->xdp\_rings out of the bounds.
Parameterize two mentioned functions so they get the size of Tx resources
array as the input.

ice: add ndo\_bpf callback for safe mode netdev ops
[ Upstream commit ebc5399ea1dfcddac31974091086a3379141899b ]
ice driver requires a programmable pipeline firmware package in order to
have a support for advanced features. Otherwise, driver falls back to so
called 'safe mode'. For that mode, ndo\_bpf callback is not exposed and
when user tries to load XDP program, the following happens:
$ sudo ./xdp1 enp179s0f1
libbpf: Kernel error message: Underlying driver does not support XDP in native mode
link set xdp fd failed
which is sort of confusing, as there is a native XDP support, but not in
the current mode. Improve the user experience by providing the specific
ndo\_bpf callback dedicated for safe mode which will make use of extack
to explicitly let the user know that the DDP package is missing and
that's the reason that the XDP can't be loaded onto interface currently.

This patch fixes TX hangs with threaded NAPI enabled. The scheduled
NAPI seems to be executed in parallel with the interrupt on second
thread. Sometimes it happens that ltq\_dma\_disable\_irq() is executed
after xrx200\_tx\_housekeeping(). The symptom is that TX interrupts
are disabled in the DMA controller. As a result, the TX hangs after
a few seconds of the iperf test. Scheduling NAPI after disabling
interrupts fixes this issue.
Tested on Lantiq xRX200 (BT Home Hub 5A).

net: ena: fix DMA mapping function issues in XDP
[ Upstream commit 504fd6a5390c30b1b7670768e314dd5d473da06a ]
This patch fixes several bugs found when (DMA/LLQ) mapping a packet for
transmission. The mapping procedure makes the transmitted packet
accessible by the device.
When using LLQ, this requires copying the packet's header to push header
(which would be passed to LLQ) and creating DMA mapping for the payload
(if the packet doesn't fit the maximum push length).
When not using LLQ, we map the whole packet with DMA.
The following bugs are fixed in the code:
1. Add support for non-LLQ machines:
The ena\_xdp\_tx\_map\_frame() function assumed that LLQ is
supported, and never mapped the whole packet using DMA. On some
instances, which don't support LLQ, this causes loss of traffic.
2. Wrong DMA buffer length passed to device:
When using LLQ, the first 'tx\_max\_header\_size' bytes of the
packet would be copied to push header. The rest of the packet
would be copied to a DMA'd buffer.
3. Freeing the XDP buffer twice in case of a mapping error:
In case a buffer DMA mapping fails, the function uses
xdp\_return\_frame\_rx\_napi() to free the RX buffer and returns from
the function with an error. XDP frames that fail to xmit get
freed by the kernel and so there is no need for this call.

vrf: fix maximum MTU
[ Upstream commit 9bb392f62447d73cc7dd7562413a2cd9104c82f8 ]
My initial goal was to fix the default MTU, which is set to 65536, ie above
the maximum defined in the driver: 65535 (ETH\_MAX\_MTU).
In fact, it's seems more consistent, wrt min\_mtu, to set the max\_mtu to
IP6\_MAX\_MTU (65535 + sizeof(struct ipv6hdr)) and use it by default.
Let's also, for consistency, set the mtu in vrf\_setup(). This function
calls ether\_setup(), which set the mtu to 1500. Thus, the whole mtu config
is done in the same function.
Before the patch:
$ ip link add blue type vrf table 1234
$ ip link list blue
9: blue:  mtu 65536 qdisc noop state DOWN mode DEFAULT group default qlen 1000
link/ether fa:f5:27:70:24:2a brd ff:ff:ff:ff:ff:ff
$ ip link set dev blue mtu 65535
$ ip link set dev blue mtu 65536
Error: mtu greater than device maximum.

mlxsw: reg: Spectrum-3: Enforce lowest max-shaper burst size of 11
[ Upstream commit 306b9228c097b4101c150ccd262372ded8348644 ]
A max-shaper is the HW component responsible for delaying egress traffic
above a configured transmission rate. Burst size is the amount of traffic
that is allowed to pass without accounting. The burst size value needs to
be such that it can be expressed as 2^BS \* 512 bits, where BS lies in a
certain ASIC-dependent range. mlxsw enforces that this holds before
attempting to configure the shaper.
The assumption for Spectrum-3 was that the lower limit of BS would be 5,
like for Spectrum-1. But as of now, the limit is still 11. Therefore fix
the driver accordingly, so that incorrect values are rejected early with a
proper message.

cfg80211, we need to use cfg80211 versions of the register
and unregister functions if called within cfg80211 methods,
otherwise deadlocks occur.

batman-adv: Avoid WARN\_ON timing related checks
[ Upstream commit 9f460ae31c4435fd022c443a6029352217a16ac1 ]
The soft/batadv interface for a queued OGM can be changed during the time
the OGM was queued for transmission and when the OGM is actually
transmitted by the worker.
But WARN\_ON must be used to denote kernel bugs and not to print simple
warnings. A warning can simply be printed using pr\_warn.

fanotify: fix copy\_event\_to\_user() fid error clean up
[ Upstream commit f644bc449b37cc32d3ce7b36a88073873aa21bd5 ]
Ensure that clean up is performed on the allocated file descriptor and
struct file object in the event that an error is encountered while copying
fid info objects. Currently, we return directly to the caller when an error
is experienced in the fid info copying helper, which isn't ideal given that
the listener process could be left with a dangling file descriptor in their
fdtable.

kvm: LAPIC: Restore guard to prevent illegal APIC register access
[ Upstream commit 218bf772bddd221489c38dde6ef8e917131161f6 ]
Per the SDM, "any access that touches bytes 4 through 15 of an APIC
register may cause undefined behavior and must not be executed."
Worse, such an access in kvm\_lapic\_reg\_read can result in a leak of
kernel stack contents. Prior to commit 01402cf81051 ("kvm: LAPIC:
write down valid APIC registers"), such an access was explicitly
disallowed. Restore the guard that was removed in that commit.

Kernel panic - not syncing: Fatal exception
A crash dump of this problem show that someone called \_\_munlock\_pagevec
to clear page LRU without lock\_page: do\_mmap -> mmap\_region -> do\_munmap
-> munlock\_vma\_pages\_range -> \_\_munlock\_pagevec.
As a result memory\_failure will call identify\_page\_state without
wait\_on\_page\_writeback. And after truncate\_error\_page clear the mapping
of this page. end\_page\_writeback won't call sb\_clear\_inode\_writeback to
clear inode->i\_wb\_list. That will trigger BUG\_ON in clear\_inode!
Fix it by checking PageWriteback too to help determine should we skip
wait\_on\_page\_writeback.

dmaengine: xilinx: dpdma: initialize registers before request\_irq
[ Upstream commit 538ea65a9fd1194352a41313bff876b74b5d90c5 ]
In some scenarios (kdump), dpdma hardware irqs has been enabled when
calling request\_irq in probe function, and then the dpdma irq handler
xilinx\_dpdma\_irq\_handler is invoked to access xdev->chan[i]. But at
this moment xdev->chan[i] hasn't been initialized.
We should ensure the dpdma controller to be in a consistent and
clean state before further initialization. So add dpdma\_hw\_init()
to do this.
Furthermore, in xilinx\_dpdma\_disable\_irq, disable all interrupts
instead of error interrupts.
This patch is to fix the kdump kernel crash as below:

mac80211: Fix NULL ptr deref for injected rate info

The commit [cb17ed2](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/cb17ed29a7a5fea8c9bf70e8a05757d71650e025) ("mac80211: parse radiotap header when selecting Tx
queue") moved the code to validate the radiotap header from
ieee80211_monitor_start_xmit to ieee80211_parse_tx_radiotap. This made is
possible to share more code with the new Tx queue selection code for
injected frames. But at the same time, it now required the call of
ieee80211_parse_tx_radiotap at the beginning of functions which wanted to
handle the radiotap header. And this broke the rate parser for radiotap
header parser.

The radiotap parser for rates is operating most of the time only on the
data in the actual radiotap header. But for the 802.11a/b/g rates, it must
also know the selected band from the chandef information. But this
information is only written to the ieee80211_tx_info at the end of the
ieee80211_monitor_start_xmit - long after ieee80211_parse_tx_radiotap was
already called. The info->band information was therefore always 0
(NL80211_BAND_2GHZ) when the parser code tried to access it.

For a 5GHz only device, injecting a frame with 802.11a rates would cause a
NULL pointer dereference because local->hw.wiphy->bands[NL80211_BAND_2GHZ]
would most likely have been NULL when the radiotap parser searched for the
correct rate index of the driver.
