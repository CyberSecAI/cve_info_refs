Based on the provided document, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability present in IBM InfoSphere Information Server. The specific details of the vulnerable code are not provided in this document.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): This type of vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into web pages viewed by other users.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The document doesn't specify the exact impact, but typical XSS attacks can lead to:
  - Session hijacking
  - Defacement of the website
  - Redirection to malicious websites
  - Unauthorized actions on behalf of the user

**Attack Vectors:**
- The document doesn't specify the exact attack vector but, generally XSS vulnerabilities are exploited by injecting malicious scripts through:
  - Input fields
  - URL parameters
  - Other areas where user input is reflected in the web page

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script code that is then rendered by the web application. This can be done by manipulating user input or by exploiting flaws in data handling.
- No specific attacker position is mentioned, but this type of vulnerability is typically exploitable remotely.

**Additional Notes:**
- The affected versions are limited to IBM InfoSphere Information Server version 11.7, as well as the cloud version.
- The fix is to apply IBM InfoSphere Information Server version 11.7.1.0 which includes the APAR JR64586.
- No workarounds or mitigations are available apart from updating the system.
