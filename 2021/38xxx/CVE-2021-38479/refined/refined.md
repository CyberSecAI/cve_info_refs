The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38479.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the lack of proper validation of raw pointers received remotely from the user. The software trusts these pointers as valid in-bound memory regions, which leads to out-of-bounds write vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Out-of-bounds write (CWE-787): The software does not validate the raw pointers received from the user, allowing attackers to write arbitrary data to attacker-controlled memory locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary data modification in memory, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution. However, the provided CVSS vector indicates only a High impact on Integrity and no impact on Confidentiality or Availability.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker can send malicious API calls with crafted raw pointers.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable service. User interaction is required since an attacker would need to send specific crafted requests to the service. The attacker does not need any prior privileges.
