Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-38402:

* **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing specific project files within the affected application. Specifically, during font string handling, the application attempts to copy data to a buffer without sufficient checks.

* **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Stack-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-121):** This is the specific vulnerability assigned CVE-2021-38402. The application fails to properly validate user-supplied data, leading to a buffer overflow on the stack when handling font strings.

*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of the stack-based buffer overflow can allow an attacker to achieve arbitrary code execution within the context of the current process. This could allow the attacker to perform various malicious actions on the system running the affected software.

*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered when the application parses a specially crafted project file. This indicates a local attack vector, requiring the attacker to provide the malicious project file to the vulnerable software.

*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious project file to the vulnerable software.
    *   The attacker needs to convince a user to open this malicious project file using the vulnerable application.
    *   The attack is not remotely exploitable.

*   **Additional Notes:**
    *   The advisory also mentions other related vulnerabilities affecting the same software:
        *   Out-of-Bounds Write (CWE-787) (CVE-2021-38406)
        *   Heap-based Buffer Overflow (CWE-122) (CVE-2021-38404)
    *   The affected software, DOPSoft 2, is end-of-life, and no updates will be provided to fix these vulnerabilities.
    *   The vendor recommends migrating to a newer product (DIAScreen) on newer hardware.
    *   The CVSS v3 score for this vulnerability is 7.8 (AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H), which indicates high impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability when exploited.
