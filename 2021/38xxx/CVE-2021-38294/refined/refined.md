Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38294:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a command injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Command Injection:** The `getTopologyHistory` service in the Apache Storm Nimbus Thrift server is vulnerable to command injection. This means an attacker can inject malicious commands into the system via a crafted thrift request.
- **Lack of Authentication:** The vulnerability exists *prior to authentication*, meaning an attacker can exploit it without needing valid credentials.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server running the vulnerable Apache Storm Nimbus service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Specially Crafted Thrift Request:** The attack vector is a specially crafted thrift request sent to the Nimbus server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the Nimbus server.
- **No Prior Authentication:** Exploitation is possible without needing to be authenticated on the system.

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache Storm 2.x prior to 2.2.1
- Apache Storm 1.x prior to 1.2.4

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Apache Storm version 2.2.1, 2.3.0, 2.1.1, or 1.2.4, depending on the affected branch.
