Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-38173

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the `ssh_filter_btrbk.sh` script used by the `btrbk` backup tool. This script is intended to restrict the commands that can be executed via SSH when using `btrbk` for remote backups.
- The script's regular expression for filtering commands was flawed, allowing specially crafted commands to bypass the intended restrictions.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Insufficient Input Validation:** The `ssh_filter_btrbk.sh` script failed to properly validate commands received via SSH, leading to the bypass.
- **Insecure Regular Expression:** The regular expression used to match allowed commands contained an error in its alternation logic, resulting in an exploitable flaw.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the target system where the `btrbk` is used to perform backups.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **SSH:** The attack vector involves exploiting the `ssh_filter_btrbk.sh` script when used in the `authorized_keys` file for SSH access. Specifically, the vulnerability can be triggered when a user connects via SSH and the `ssh_filter_btrbk.sh` script is used to filter commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to SSH:** The attacker needs to have the ability to connect to the target server via SSH.
- **Control over SSH Command:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the commands executed when connecting via SSH (specifically, the `SSH_ORIGINAL_COMMAND`). This is typically achieved by having control over the SSH key used for authentication if authorized_keys is used in a specific way.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerability:** Some understanding of the `ssh_filter_btrbk.sh` script and its flaw is required to craft a successful exploit.

**Additional Details:**

- The fix involves correcting the regular expression in `ssh_filter_btrbk.sh`.
- The issue affects `btrbk` versions >= v0.23.0.
- The vulnerability was reported via responsible disclosure.
