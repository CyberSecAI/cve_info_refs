Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is a SQL injection in the DataEase application. The specific vulnerable endpoint is `/api/sys_msg/list/1/10`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `orders` parameter in the request body, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary SQL queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker could potentially gain access to sensitive data, modify data, or even take control of the database server. The provided examples in the issue show an attacker could:
    *   Cause a time delay using `sleep()` function.
    *   Extract the database name using `select database()`.
    *   Potentially extract other data with the `extractvalue()` function.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **HTTP POST request:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending a crafted POST request to the vulnerable endpoint `/api/sys_msg/list/1/10`.
*   **JSON payload:** The malicious SQL injection payload is included in the request body as JSON data within the `orders` array.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the DataEase server.
*   The attacker needs to know the vulnerable API endpoint `/api/sys_msg/list/1/10`.
*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious SQL payload.

**Additional Details:**

*   The report also mentions the version of DataEase affected, which is 1.1.0-rc2.
*   The vulnerability has been marked as high priority and has been addressed in version 1.2.0.
*   The reported provided sample HTTP request and payload.
