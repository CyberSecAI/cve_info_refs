Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38498:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free error during process shutdown. Specifically, a document could trigger a use-after-free of the `nsLanguageAtomService` object. This object is responsible for providing language-related services.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core weakness is that the `nsLanguageAtomService` object is accessed after it has been freed from memory. This occurs because `nsLanguageAtomService` was relying on `ClearOnShutdown` for cleanup, which was happening before `nsLayoutStatics` was being shutdown.
- **Incorrect Shutdown Order:** The order in which certain components were being shut down was incorrect. `nsLayoutStatics` could still be active when `nsLanguageAtomService` was being cleared.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Memory corruption:** The use-after-free can lead to memory corruption.
- **Potentially exploitable crash:** The memory corruption can cause the program to crash. This crash could potentially be exploited to run arbitrary code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered during the shutdown of the browser process. It is related to a document trying to access a freed language service object.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by an attacker that can control the content of a loaded document which causes the service to be used after it is freed.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Ability to load a crafted document:** An attacker needs to be able to load a malicious HTML document or manipulate existing content in such a way that it triggers the use-after-free. This could be achieved by serving the crafted document from a malicious website or through other methods to get the user to load the crafted document.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability was found using AddressSanitizer (ASAN), a memory error detector.
- The fix involves explicitly shutting down `nsLanguageAtomService` in `nsLayoutStatics::Shutdown` instead of relying on `ClearOnShutdown`, ensuring that the service is not used after being deallocated.
- Another related issue was found with `nsNameSpaceManager`, which was fixed by having `nsContentUtils` hold a strong reference to it.
- The vulnerability is rated as "moderate" impact.
- The vulnerability affects Firefox ESR and Thunderbird.
- Patches were created and uplifted to Firefox 93, Firefox ESR 91.2 and Thunderbird 91.2
