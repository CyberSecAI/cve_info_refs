Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-38140

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The `set_user` extension for PostgreSQL failed to block the `RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` command after a `set_user()` call. This allowed a user to potentially escalate privileges by resetting the session authorization after it had been set by the `set_user()` function.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insufficient access control. The extension was intended to manage role-related session variables, including preventing changes to the user/role via `RESET ROLE`. However, it failed to block `RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION`.
- Incomplete blocking of reset commands: The initial implementation blocked `RESET ROLE`, but missed `RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION`, leading to a bypass of the intended security controls.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Potential privilege escalation. By using `RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` after `set_user()`, a user could potentially circumvent the intended access controls enforced by `set_user()` and elevate their privileges to those of the user set initially.

**Attack vectors:**
- Direct SQL commands. An attacker with the ability to execute SQL commands within a PostgreSQL session could exploit the vulnerability by issuing a `RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION` command.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must have the ability to execute SQL commands within a PostgreSQL session where the vulnerable `set_user` extension is installed. This would mean the attacker needs to be a valid user of the PostgreSQL database.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is fixed in version 2.0.1 of the `set_user` extension.
- The fix involves blocking `RESET SESSION AUTHORIZATION`, along with `RESET ROLE`.
- The `RESET USER` command check was dropped as it's an invalid syntax.
- The error messages associated with blocking SET/RESET have been updated to be more accurate.
