  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The power indicator LED of various devices is connected directly to the power line, and the intensity of the LED is correlative to the power consumption, which in turn fluctuates with the audio being played.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Lack of dedicated means to counter the correlation between power consumption and LED intensity.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Eavesdroppers can recover sound (speech) by analyzing optical measurements obtained via an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of various devices.",
  "Attack vectors": "Analyzing the optical emanations from a device's power indicator LED with an electro-optical sensor.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within line of sight of the target device's power LED and have access to an electro-optical sensor. The attacker can be up to 35 meters away for fair intelligibility, and 15 meters away for good intelligibility"
