Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38655:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way Microsoft Excel parses XLS files.
- Specifically, the issue is a use-after-free vulnerability that arises from a lack of validation of an object's existence before performing operations on it. This means the program attempts to access memory that has already been freed, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free condition, where a program accesses memory after it has been released.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution:** Successful exploitation allows a remote attacker to execute arbitrary code on the affected system.
- **Context of the Current Process:** The attacker's code runs with the privileges of the current Excel process.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious File:** The primary attack vector is through a malicious XLS file.
- **User Interaction:** Exploitation requires user interaction as the target user must open the malicious file.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Remote:** The attacker can be remote.
- **User Interaction:** The attacker needs to trick the user into opening a malicious XLS file.

**Summary:**

CVE-2021-38655 is a use-after-free vulnerability in Microsoft Excel's XLS file parsing. By crafting a malicious XLS file, an attacker can execute arbitrary code when the file is opened by a user. The root cause is insufficient validation of object existence before usage within Excel's processing of XLS files, leading to a use-after-free condition, which provides the ability to execute code in the context of the user opening the malformed document.
