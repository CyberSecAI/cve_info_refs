The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38393.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper neutralization of special elements used in an SQL command, specifically a Blind SQL injection vulnerability in the `/DataHandler/HandlerAlarmGroup.ashx` endpoint. The application fails to properly validate the user-controlled value supplied through the `agid` parameter before using it in an SQL query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper input validation.
- Blind SQL Injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A remote, unauthenticated attacker can execute arbitrary code in the context of `NT SERVICE\MSSQLSERVER`. This could lead to complete system compromise.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network based attack.
- Sending a crafted request to the `/DataHandler/HandlerAlarmGroup.ashx` endpoint with a malicious `agid` parameter.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to send network requests to the vulnerable application.
- No prior authentication is required to exploit the vulnerability.
