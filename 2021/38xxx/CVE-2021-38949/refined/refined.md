- **Root cause of vulnerability**: IBM MQ Java and JMS clients could display clear text credentials in diagnostic log files automatically generated during system crashes.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Exposure of sensitive information (clear text credentials) in diagnostic logs.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Unauthorized access to credentials, potentially leading to further unauthorized access or actions within the system.
- **Attack vectors**: System crashes leading to generation of diagnostic logs containing credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Access to diagnostic logs generated by affected IBM MQ Java/JMS clients.
