Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38090:

**Verification:**

The provided content directly relates to a vulnerability in `libavfilter/vf_convolution.c` which is part of the FFmpeg project. The vulnerability involves signed integer overflows and out-of-range values. Although the CVE ID is not explicitly mentioned, the included ticket number #8263 from ffmpeg's trac system is linked to the fix commit `99f8d32129dd233d4eb2efa44678a0bc44869f23`. The CVE-2021-38090 is indeed about signed integer overflow issues in FFmpeg as can be seen from the official description:
"Integer Overflow or Wraparound vulnerability in convolution filter in FFmpeg 4.4 and earlier allows attacker to cause a denial of service or possibly achieve code execution." This confirms the relevance.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from signed integer overflow and out-of-range value issues within the `libavfilter/vf_convolution.c` file, specifically at line 139, during convolution filtering. The multiplication and addition operations resulted in values that exceeded the representable range of the 'int' data type, leading to undefined behavior.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Signed Integer Overflow:** The code performs arithmetic operations (multiplication and addition) on signed integers without proper bounds checking or overflow handling, leading to values wrapping around, which causes unexpected behavior. This results in wrong calculations and potential memory corruption.
    *   **Out-of-range value:** In one case the result was a NaN which could not be converted to an integer.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** The immediate impact of this vulnerability is undefined behavior, which, according to the CVE description, can lead to a denial of service (DoS) due to program crashes.  It also mentions the possibility of achieving code execution.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted input (a PoC is provided in the ticket) to the `roberts` filter through the `ffmpeg` command-line tool.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to provide a malicious input file to the ffmpeg command line with a specific filter enabled (`roberts` in this case) which will trigger the overflow.

**Technical Details:**

The provided log from UndefinedBehaviorSanitizer (UBSAN) gives specific details:

*   `libavfilter/vf_convolution.c:139:48: runtime error: signed integer overflow: -65535 * -65535 cannot be represented in type 'int'`
*   `libavfilter/vf_convolution.c:139:36: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 65535 * 65535 cannot be represented in type 'int'`
*   `libavfilter/vf_convolution.c:139:26: runtime error: -nan is outside the range of representable values of type 'int'`
*   `libavfilter/vf_convolution.c:139:42: runtime error: signed integer overflow: 1712056129 + 1886425489 cannot be represented in type 'int'`

These logs highlight the precise locations and the nature of the integer overflow and out of range issues.

**Fix Information:**

The commit `99f8d32129dd233d4eb2efa44678a0bc44869f23` addresses the issue, as noted in the commit message: "avfilter/vf\_convolution: fix undefined behaviour".

The fix is targeted at the `libavfilter/vf_convolution.c` file, which was identified as the vulnerable component.

**Additional Notes:**

The `gdb-vf_convolution_139` attachment likely contains debugging information from when this issue was discovered. The `PoC_vf_convolution_139.png48` attachment is a proof-of-concept input that can be used to trigger the vulnerability.

In summary, the provided information describes a signed integer overflow vulnerability in the `vf_convolution` filter of FFmpeg, which can lead to crashes, denial of service, and potentially code execution. The attack vector involves crafted input to trigger the vulnerable code path in the `roberts` filter. The commit `99f8d32129dd233d4eb2efa44678a0bc44869f23` was provided as the fix for this issue.
