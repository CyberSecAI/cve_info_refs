Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

*   **Root Cause:** Missing authorization in the Advantech WebAccess SCADA software.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper authorization checks, allowing an authenticated user to access API functions that should be restricted to other users. This allows an authenticated user to disclose project names and paths from other users.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to access project names and paths.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through network access using API functions.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the WebAccess SCADA software. The attack can be performed remotely and requires low attack complexity.
