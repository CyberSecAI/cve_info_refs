{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper validation of user-supplied data within the parsing of DOC files, leading to a type confusion condition.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Type confusion vulnerability during the parsing of DOC files due to improper validation of user-supplied data.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attacker needs to provide a malicious DOC file or have the target visit a malicious page containing the exploit.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to either convince the user to open a specially crafted DOC file or to visit a malicious page. User interaction is required for successful exploitation."
