The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38467.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is caused by a use-after-free condition. A specific function code receives a raw pointer supplied by the user and deallocates this pointer. The user can then control what memory regions will be freed.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Use-after-free (CWE-416): The program continues to use a pointer after the memory it references has been freed.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to a denial of service and potential arbitrary code execution.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be exploited remotely via the affected product's proprietary protocol, CSC.
- An attacker needs to be able to interact with the vulnerable service and send crafted function calls.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send commands to the service and provide a raw pointer.
- The attacker would need to have a low privileged user access to the affected system.
- User interaction is required as the attack vector involves crafted function calls via the service protocol.
