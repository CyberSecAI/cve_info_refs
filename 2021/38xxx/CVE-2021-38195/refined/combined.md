# libsecp256k1 allows overflowing signatures
libsecp256k1 accepts signatures whose R or S parameter is larger than the
secp256k1 curve order, which differs from other implementations. This could
lead to invalid signatures being verified.
The error is resolved in 0.5.0 by adding a `check\_overflow` flag.
