This repo contains the source code for the Form Tools Core. The Core provides the minimal code needed to run Form Tools
on your server.

### Branches and releases

* The `master` branch contains the current ongoing work. Never assume it's stable, and never use code from this
  branch on your production environments - it's only for development.
* Code for specific versions have a branch by that name (e.g. `3.0.13`), but again, this isn't for consumption. The
  releases section of github contains code that's ready for use:
  ([https://github.com/formtools/core/releases)[https://github.com/formtools/core/releases]](https://github.com/formtools/core/releases%29%5Bhttps%3A//github.com/formtools/core/releases%5D)

### Form Tools 2 and 3

Form Tools 2 was the production version from 2010-2018. I took a long, 4-year break during that time to work on other
projects, but returned to the Form Tools world in 2016 to revamp the site and code. Form Tools 2 was entirely functional
code. Form Tools 3 (2018) was a complete rewrite of the application. Form Tools started back in 2004 and this was the third
(and hardest!) rewrite. The broader goal was to simply modernize the script, but there were also some specific goals:
run on PHP 7, use PDO, update all lib dependencies up to date, introduce tests and pave the way for upcoming changes and
features.

#### Upcoming versions

* `3.0.x` - Misc updates paving the way for 3.1.
* `3.1` - rewriting the installation/upgrade code so that there's no longer hardcoded bundles of the Form Tools script including those modules/themes we choose, but instead you select whatever components your want during the installation, or later on.
* `3.2` - revamping the UI. Totally new design, upgrading all the front-end code (i.e. moving to React)
* `3.3` - revamping the user permissions to make it roles-based and not have hardcoded "admin" and "client" accounts like now.

### PHP version support

* Everything up to *Form Tools Core 2.2.7* supports PHP 4.3 - 5.x.
* *Form Tools Core 3.0.0* supports PHP 5.3 and later.

# FORM TOOLS

## Data Management

Form Tools is a powerful, flexible, free and open source PHP/MySQL script you install
on your website for managing your forms and data.

Continue »

![Form Tools interface](https://formtools.org/assets/img/art/laptop-formtools.png)

# Create new forms or process your own.

Forms come in all shapes and sizes. You can use Form Tools to house the data from your
[own forms](https://docs.formtools.org/userdoc/form_management/adding_external_forms/),
[create private forms](https://docs.formtools.org/userdoc/form_management/adding_internal_forms/)
for use by specific users only, or [create
forms right on your website](https://docs.formtools.org/modules/form_builder/) - all with no programming knowledge needed.

[Form Types](https://docs.formtools.org/userdoc/form_management/form_types/)
Continue »

![](https://formtools.org/assets/img/art/form.png)

# Plug n' play modules.

Form Tools offers a range of extra functionality through optional modules, letting you
tailor your installation for your own project requirements. And if the module doesn't
already exist, you can always write your own!

[View Modules](https://modules.formtools.org)
Continue »

# Customizable user accounts.

Create as many accounts as you need. Accounts can be set up to show exactly
which forms, and form fields you want the user to see. Control read and write
privileges, what data export options are available, and much more.

Continue »

![](https://formtools.org/assets/img/art/account.png)

# Visualize and Export.

Form Tools is much more than just a *data gatherer*. It lets you visualize your
form submission data through the [Data
Visualization module](https://docs.formtools.org/modules/data_visualization) and provides a simple way to
[export your data](https://docs.formtools.org/modules/export_manager) for use
in whatever other applications you need.

Continue »

![](https://formtools.org/assets/img/art/graphs.png)

# Localize Form Tools.

With over 50 translations available, using Form Tools in your language is as simple
as selecting it from within the Form Tools interface. Each account can have their own
language setting.

[Translations](https://translations.formtools.org)
Continue »

# And yup, there's an API.

An API is available for people wishing to do a deep integration with Form Tools. The
API provides ways to submit form data via code rather than form POSTs,
helper functions for things like maintaining sessions, displaying
captchas, and much more.
