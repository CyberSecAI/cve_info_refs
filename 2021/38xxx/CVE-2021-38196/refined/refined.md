- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `better-macro` crate deliberately executes arbitrary code within its procedural macro, demonstrating that such macros can be used for remote code execution (RCE).
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The crate's `println` function, when used, opens a URL using the `open` command. While currently it opens a benign markdown file, the URL and content could be changed to point to a malicious resource or to execute arbitrary system commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  An attacker could execute arbitrary code on a user's machine by including this crate as a dependency in a Rust project. Currently, the impact is limited to opening a file, but the possibility of arbitrary command execution is present, making it a remote code execution vulnerability.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the inclusion of the `better-macro` crate in a project's dependencies.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to publish the crate on a package repository (like crates.io) and persuade or trick a user into adding it to their project's dependencies.
