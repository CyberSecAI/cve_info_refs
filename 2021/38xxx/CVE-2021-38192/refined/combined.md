### Description

Affected versions of this crate contained a bug in which untrusted input could cause an overflow and panic when converting a `Timestamp` to `SystemTime`.

It is recommended to upgrade to `prost-types` v0.8 and switch the usage of `From<Timestamp> for SystemTime` to `TryFrom<Timestamp> for SystemTime`.

See [#438](https://github.com/tokio-rs/prost/issues/438) for more information.
