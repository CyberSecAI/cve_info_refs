The provided content is related to a Remote Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability in easy-mock version 1.6.0. However, the CVE field is marked as "N/A," indicating that this exploit is not associated with a specific CVE.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability details:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from the ability to inject and execute arbitrary code within the "mode" parameter when creating a mock API. The application uses a function constructor and `child_process.execSync` to achieve remote code execution when previewing a mock.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
    *   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):**  The primary vulnerability is the ability to execute arbitrary system commands on the server hosting the easy-mock application.
    *   **Insecure use of Function Constructor:** The code utilizes the `Function` constructor to dynamically create and execute code from user-supplied input, a dangerous practice that makes the application vulnerable to code injection.
    *  **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The application does not properly sanitize user-provided input before using it in a way that allows arbitrary code execution.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**
    *   **Full System Compromise:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete control of the server, allowing attackers to read sensitive data, modify files, install malware, or disrupt services.
*   **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Web-Based Attack:** The exploit is delivered via HTTP requests to the easy-mock web application.
    *   **Authenticated Access Required:** The attacker needs to be authenticated user to create and modify mocks.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   **Authenticated User:** The attacker must register an account and log in to the easy-mock application.
    *   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to reach the easy-mock application.

**Exploit Details**
The provided python script demonstrates the exploitation process:
1. **Registration and Login**: Creates a new user account and logs in to get an authentication token.
2. **Project Creation**: Creates a new project which is required for creating mocks.
3. **Project ID retrieval**: Retrieves the project ID using the API.
4. **Mock Creation**: Creates a new mock API endpoint and injects malicious Javascript into the "mode" field. This javascript includes a payload that gets executed by the server when the mock is previewed.
5. **Mock Preview:** The final request accesses the created mock API endpoint which triggers the payload resulting in execution of the attacker specified command.

**Additional Details:**

*   The exploit script targets easy-mock versions 1.5.0 - 1.6.0.
*   The script was tested on Windows 10 with Node.js v8.17.0.
*   The provided example command is `calc.exe`, which would launch the calculator on a Windows machine.
*   The exploit is "blind," meaning the attacker does not directly receive the output of the executed command.
