Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38491:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the Mixed Content Blocker's inability to properly analyze opaque origins. Specifically, the blocker was not checking the embedding context of subresources loaded from opaque origins (like `data:` or `srcdoc` iframes). This oversight allowed mixed content to load even when it should have been blocked.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insufficient Mixed Content Checks:** The core issue is that the Mixed Content Blocker (MCB) failed to apply its checks when dealing with content loaded within opaque origins. The MCB logic primarily relied on the immediate parent context, neglecting the security implications of opaque origins.
*   **Opaque Origin Bypass:** Opaque origins, such as those created by `data:` URLs or `srcdoc` iframes, were not correctly handled by the MCB. This created a loophole allowing insecure content to be loaded in secure contexts.
*   **Missing `isSecureContext` Propagation:** The `isSecureContext` flag was not being inherited by opaque origins. Thus, the MCB was unable to utilize it for security checks.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Loading of Mixed Content:** An attacker could bypass the Mixed Content Blocker and load insecure (HTTP) resources within a secure (HTTPS) context. This is a classic mixed content issue.
*   **Potential for XSS:** Although not explicitly stated, the ability to load arbitrary HTTP resources can often lead to cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities if the attacker controls the HTTP resource. It is implied through the description of the risk, and the security category of the bug.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **`data:` URL iframes:** By injecting a `data:` URL iframe that contains another iframe loading an HTTP resource, an attacker could bypass the MCB.
*   **`srcdoc` iframes:** Similar to `data:` URLs, `srcdoc` iframes could be used to load insecure content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject HTML:** The attacker needs to inject HTML into a page that is loaded over HTTPS. This could happen via an existing XSS vulnerability, or a website that allows user-generated content.
*   **No direct access to modify browser settings:** Exploitation does not require modifying browser configuration.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The bug report mentions that `localhost` is considered a secure context and is exempt from mixed content blocking.
*   The fix involved tracking precursor origins on null principals to determine if an opaque origin was created from a secure context. This allows the MCB to enforce policies even in opaque contexts.
*   The vulnerability was considered "sec-moderate," highlighting the security risk of bypassing the mixed content blocker.
*   The issue was resolved in Firefox 92 and was not backported to ESR versions due to the complexity of the required changes.
