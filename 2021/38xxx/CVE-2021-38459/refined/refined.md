The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38459.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a lack of replay protection during the initial handshake phase, allowing an attacker to capture and replay network traffic to authenticate as a SYSDBA.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* Authentication Bypass by Capture-replay (CWE-294)

**Impact of exploitation:**
* Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to gain SYSDBA permissions, which enables them to change user passwords or delete the database.
* Complete remote control of the machine could be achieved when chained with other vulnerabilities detailed in the advisory.

**Attack vectors:**
* Network-based attack
* Capturing network traffic during the initial handshake phase.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* Network access to the vulnerable system.
* Ability to capture network traffic between the client and the server.
* Requires low attack complexity, no user interaction, and no prior privileges.
