Based on the provided content, this commit `eed32638f4f6e3b2f4b8a9a04c4b72001acf9ad8` is related to the removal of the Export feature in `gitit`. The commit message states:

"This feature is a security risk; it provided multiple vectors by which contents of files could be exposed."

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The "Export" feature in `gitit` was identified as a security risk due to multiple vectors for exposing file contents. The specific nature of these vectors isn't detailed, but the removal suggests a potential for unauthorized access or information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The primary weakness was within the export functionality, allowing potential exposure of file contents through multiple unspecified vectors. This could relate to vulnerabilities such as:

*   Path traversal
*   Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)
*   Unintended disclosure of internal server files
*   Abuse of export functionality to trigger server errors or resource exhaustion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the export feature could lead to:

*   Unauthorized access to sensitive files managed by the `gitit` wiki.
*   Disclosure of confidential information.
*   Potential server-side attacks, depending on the specific vectors involved.

**Attack Vectors:**
The commit message indicates "multiple vectors," implying that the export feature had several points of weakness that could be exploited. However, specific details about the attack vectors are not provided.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker would likely need the ability to interact with the `gitit` web interface, specifically through the export feature. Access to the server itself might not be necessary to trigger the vulnerability, assuming it can be exploited via the web interface.

**Summary:**
The commit removes the Export feature due to multiple unspecified security vulnerabilities that could lead to unauthorized file access and information disclosure. The removal of the feature is a security fix and a breaking change.
