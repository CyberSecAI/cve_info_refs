The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the Brizy Page Builder plugin, including one specifically related to CVE-2021-38345.

**Root cause of vulnerability (CVE-2021-38345):**

*   Incorrect authorization checks in the `Brizy_Editor::is_administrator` and `Brizy_Editor_User:is_administrator` functions.  These functions incorrectly determined a user as an administrator if they were logged in and accessing any endpoint in the `wp-admin` directory, due to the use of the `is_admin()` function. This bypassed the plugin's intended capability checks.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present (CVE-2021-38345):**

*   **Incorrect Authorization:** The plugin incorrectly grants administrator privileges to any logged-in user. This is due to a flawed logic that checks if a user is an administrator based on whether they are logged in and accessing wp-admin area.
*   **Reintroduction of vulnerability:** The vulnerability was initially patched in version 1.0.126 but reintroduced in version 1.0.127.

**Impact of exploitation (CVE-2021-38345):**

*   **Post modification:** All logged-in users, even subscribers, could modify any post or page created or edited with the Brizy editor, regardless of publishing status. This could lead to replacement of original page content.
*   **Enabling other vulnerabilities:** This incorrect authorization flaw enabled further vulnerabilities, allowing for site takeover, which is described separately.

**Attack vectors (CVE-2021-38345):**

*   A low-privileged attacker (any logged-in user) can send requests to modify page content.

**Required attacker capabilities/position (CVE-2021-38345):**

*   The attacker must have a user account with any level of privilege on the target WordPress site.

**Additional details:**

*   The article notes that this vulnerability was originally patched in version 1.0.126 but was reintroduced in version 1.0.127.
*   The incorrect access control vulnerability was a crucial factor in exploiting two other severe vulnerabilities: an Authenticated Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability and an Authenticated File Upload and Path Traversal vulnerability. These two additional vulnerabilties are assigned CVE-2021-38344 and CVE-2021-38346 respectively.
