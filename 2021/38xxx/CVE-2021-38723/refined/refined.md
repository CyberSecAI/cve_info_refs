The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38723.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper input sanitization when processing the 'col' parameter in the `/fuel/index.php/fuel/pages/items` endpoint. This allows for the injection of arbitrary SQL queries.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability exists due to insufficient input validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries.
- This can lead to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- The attacker could potentially gain control of the database server.
- Information disclosure, data integrity loss.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through HTTP GET request to the `/fuel/index.php/fuel/pages/items` endpoint.
- The 'col' parameter in the URL is used to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP GET requests to the vulnerable server.
- The attacker does not need authentication.
- The attacker needs to understand SQL syntax.
