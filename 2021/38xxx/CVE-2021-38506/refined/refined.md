{
  "CVE-2021-38506": {
    "description": "Through a series of navigations, Firefox could have entered fullscreen mode without notification or warning to the user. This could lead to spoofing attacks on the browser UI including phishing.",
    "root_cause": "The browser failed to properly exit fullscreen mode when navigating to a page in the back/forward cache after a fullscreen request. This resulted in a state where the browser was in fullscreen mode without displaying the usual notification.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of fullscreen state during navigation with bfcache",
      "Lack of proper security notification display in fullscreen mode after specific navigation"
    ],
    "impact": "Spoofing attacks on the browser UI, including phishing, due to the lack of fullscreen notification, leading users to be unaware that the browser is in full screen.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Malicious websites using JavaScript to request fullscreen mode",
       "Navigating away from the fullscreen page and then back to it using the back/forward cache"
    ],
     "required_attacker_capabilities": "The attacker must be able to host a web page and control navigation, and the victim must visit the page and navigate it as directed by the attacker."
