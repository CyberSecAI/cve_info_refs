- **Root cause of vulnerability:** SQL injection in `SEMCMS_User.php`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  Unsanitized input in the `ID` parameter leading to SQL injection vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary SQL commands. This could potentially allow them to read, modify, or delete sensitive data from the database.
- **Attack vectors:** A specially crafted request containing malicious SQL code injected through the `ID` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to send requests to the vulnerable application and manipulate the `ID` parameter.
