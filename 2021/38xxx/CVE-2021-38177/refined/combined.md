  CVE-2021-38177
- Vendor patch Information: SAP Security NOTE 3051787

## Affected Components Description

The SAP Cryptographic Library manages digital signatures in SAP systems as
well
as provides several features related to encryption. For example, it acts as
the
security provider for SNC, TLS, SPNego or SSF.
This library is present in most SAP systems and its components, like SAP
Netweaver,
SAP HANA DB, Webdispatcher, Content Server, SAP Host Agent and more.

## Vulnerability Details

A memory corruption vulnerability exists for ```secssf_SsfVerifyEx()``` in
SAP
CommonCryptoLib. A null pointer dereference can be triggered by
unauthenticated
attacker by sending a specially crafted HTTP request with malicious cookie
data.
This causes the application to crash.

## Solution

SAP has released SAP Note 3051787 which provides patched versions of the
affected components.

The patches can be downloaded from
<https://launchpad.support.sap.com/#/notes/3051787>.

Onapsis strongly recommends SAP customers to download the related
security fixes and apply them to the affected components in order to
reduce business risks.
