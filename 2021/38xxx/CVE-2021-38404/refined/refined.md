The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38404.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the affected application's (Delta Electronics DOPSoft 2) lack of proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing specific project files.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap-based buffer overflow (CWE-122)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this heap-based buffer overflow vulnerability can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary code within the context of the current process.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector involves parsing maliciously crafted project files by the vulnerable application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to supply the application with a specially crafted project file. This requires the attacker to have some form of access to the target system in order to deliver the malicious project file. The attack complexity is considered low, and user interaction is required, as the user must open the malicious file.
