  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The serverless-offline plugin incorrectly handles routes with trailing slashes when using custom authorizers, leading to a discrepancy in authorization behavior between the local development environment and the actual AWS environment.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect authorization implementation",
       "Discrepancy between local and production environments"
    ],
    "impact": "A developer using serverless-offline might implement incorrect access controls because the local environment returns a 403 status code for a route with a trailing slash while AWS returns a 200 status code for the same route, potentially granting more permissions than expected.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network requests to routes with trailing slashes"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs to understand the incorrect behavior of serverless-offline and exploit the discrepancy during development."
