### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in [GitHub Advanced Security](https://github.com/enterprise/advanced-security).

#### What if I do not want Copilot?

Copilot is entirely optional and requires you to opt in before gaining access. You can easily configure its usage directly in the editor, enabling or disabling it at any time. Additionally, you have control over which file types Copilot is active for.

#### How do I control access to Copilot in my company?

Access to Copilot Business and Enterprise is managed by your GitHub Administrator. They can control access to preview features, models, and set Copilot policies for your organization. Additionally, you can use your network firewall to explicitly allow access to Copilot Business and/or block access to Copilot Pro or Free. For more details, refer to the [documentation](https://docs.github.com/en/copilot/managing-copilot/managing-github-copilot-in-your-organization/managing-access-to-github-copilot-in-your-organization).

#### Plans & Pricing

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses.

[Vulnerability details](/advisories/GHSA-h97f-5258-5593)
[Dependabot alerts
0](/advisories/GHSA-h97f-5258-5593/dependabot)

## Package

npm

serverless-offline
([npm](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Anpm))

## Affected versions

<= 8.0.0

## Patched versions

None

## Description

Serverless Offline 8.0.0 returns a 403 HTTP status code for a route that has a trailing `/` character, which might cause a developer to implement incorrect access control, because the actual behavior within the Amazon AWS environment is a 200 HTTP status code (i.e., possibly greater than expected permissions).

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### **[LVSant](/LVSant)** commented [Aug 5, 2021](#issue-962089370)

| Bug Report **Current Behavior**  When using a Custom Authorizer, the behaviour of serverless-offline differs from the deployed stack on AWS.  **Sample Code**  This is where we define the function event trigger. As it's clear to see, we expect a HTTP POST on `/{stage}/dashboard/`   * file: trailingSlash/index.ts  ```   events: [{   	http: {   		method: 'post',   		path: 'dashboard',   		cors: true,   		authorizer: 'auth',   	}   }] ```  Our custom authorizer **generatePolicy** method looks like this.   * file: auth/handler.js  ``` const generatePolicy = (principalId: string, methodArn: string, role: string) => {  	const allowedResources = []; 	//arn:aws:execute-api:region:account-id:api-id/stage-name/HTTP-method/resource-path 	const baseArn = methodArn.split(`/`, 2).join('/');  	switch (role.toUpperCase()) { 		case 'ADMIN': 			allowedResources.push(`${baseArn}/*/*`) 			break; 		case 'USER': 			allowedResources.push(`${baseArn}/*/dashboard/*`) 			break; 		default: 			break; 	} 	const generatedPolicy = { 		principalId: principalId, 		policyDocument: { 			Version: "2012-10-17", 			Statement: [{ 				Action: "execute-api:Invoke", 				Effect: "Allow", 				Resource: [ 					...allowedResources, 				] 			}], 		}, 	}; 	return generatedPolicy; }; ```  We're basically generating the following policy to someone with the role "USER":  ```  {  	"principalId": "1234567890",  	"policyDocument": {  		"Version": "2012-10-17",  		"Statement": [{  			"Action": "execute-api:Invoke",  			"Effect": "Allow",  			"Resource": [  			"arn:aws:execute-api:us-east-1:random-account-id:random-api-id/dev/*/dashboard/*"  			]  		}]  	}  } ```  **Expected behavior/code**  When testing locally using serverless-offline, fetching the endpoint <http://localhost:3000/dev/dashboard/>, the response is 403 Forbidden [as the screenshot shows](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1KrdyqVYeeEqC8JhOjbrm-7mWYsrVjF50/view?usp=sharing). But when we deploy the stack to AWS, fetching the endpoint <https://RANDOM.execute-api.us-east-1.amazonaws.com/dev/dashboard/>, the result is 200 ok as its seen [here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1SKrq3V3bIV7ZRPOf7pJ6UHp2QfR8vqyb/view?usp=sharing).  **Environment**   * `serverless` version: v2.53.0 * `serverless-offline` version: v8.0.0 * `node.js` version: v12.21.0 * `OS`: Linux Mint 19.1 Tessa   **Additional context/Screenshots**  We found this issue while doing the research [The Fault in Our Stars](https://www.tenchisecurity.com/blog/thefaultinourstars), in which we explore how API Gateway Execute API Policy works under different conditions. One researcher from our company opened the issue [1191](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/issues/1191) where he indicates another incorrectly behaviour by serverless-offline regarding the way it evaluates policies. It still lacks a response to this date. |

| [@LVSant](https://github.com/LVSant)  We found this issue while doing the research [The Fault in Our Stars](https://www.tenchisecurity.com/blog/thefaultinourstars), in which we explore how API Gateway Execute API Policy works under different conditions. One researcher from our company opened the issue [#1191](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/issues/1191) where he indicates another incorrectly behaviour by serverless-offline regarding the way it evaluates policies. It still lacks a response to this date.  It'd be nice if you were to at least recreate the defect with some tests, then it'd help both the resolution of the reported defect and prevent regression.  [@dherault](https://github.com/dherault) which commit addresses this issue?  According to <https://security.snyk.io/vuln/SNYK-JS-SERVERLESSOFFLINE-1540299> they claim `Upgrade serverless-offline to version 8.6.0 or higher.` but then refer to this commit - [92b2fff](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/commit/92b2fff80f79b0a1c9a9e1b689fcc25625cea301) which I am sure it fixes it? And looking at the rest of the changeset of the release ([v8.5.0...v8.6.0](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/compare/v8.5.0...v8.6.0) for reference) I'm not certain it is address by this.  Going to repro it locally and check which version is it fixed in. |

This [Serverless](https://github.com/serverless/serverless) plugin emulates [AWS λ](https://aws.amazon.com/lambda) and [API Gateway](https://aws.amazon.com/api-gateway) on your local machine to speed up your development cycles.
To do so, it starts an HTTP server that handles the request's lifecycle like APIG does and invokes your handlers.

**Features**

* [Node.js](https://nodejs.org), [Python](https://www.python.org), [Ruby](https://www.ruby-lang.org), [Go](https://golang.org), [Java](https://www.java.com) (incl. [Kotlin](https://kotlinlang.org), [Groovy](https://groovy-lang.org), [Scala](https://www.scala-lang.org)) λ runtimes.
* Velocity templates support.
* Lazy loading of your handler files.
* And more: integrations, authorizers, proxies, timeouts, responseParameters, HTTPS, CORS, etc...

This plugin is updated by its users, I just do maintenance and ensure that PRs are relevant to the community. In other words, if you [find a bug or want a new feature](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/issues), please help us by becoming one of the [contributors](https://github.com/dherault/serverless-offline/graphs/contributors) ✌️ !

## Installation

First, add Serverless Offline to your project:

`npm install serverless-offline --save-dev`

Then inside your project's `serverless.yml` file add following entry to the plugins section: `serverless-offline`. If there is no plugin section you will need to add it to the file.

**Note that the "plugin" section for serverless-offline must be at root level on serverless.yml.**

It should look something like this:

```
plugins:
  - serverless-offline
```

You can check whether you have successfully installed the plugin by running the serverless command line:

`serverless --verbose`

the console should display *Offline* as one of the plugins now available in your Serverless project.

## Usage and command line options

In your project root run:

`serverless offline` or `sls offline`.

to list all the options for the plugin run:

`sls offline --help`

All CLI options are optional:

#### corsAllowHeaders

Default: localhost

#### dockerHostServicePath

Defines service path which is used by SLS running inside Docker container.

#### dockerNetwork

The network that the Docker container will connect to.

#### dockerReadOnly

Marks if the docker code layer should be read only.

Default: true

#### enforceSecureCookies

Enforce secure cookies

#### host

-o Host name to listen on.

Default: localhost

#### httpPort

Http port to listen on.

Default: 3000

#### httpsProtocol

-H To enable HTTPS, specify directory (relative to your cwd, typically your project dir) for both cert.pem and key.pem files.

#### ignoreJWTSignature

When using HttpApi with a JWT authorizer, don't check the signature of the JWT token.

#### lambdaPort

Lambda http port to listen on.

Default: 3002

#### layersDir

The directory layers should be stored in.

Default: ${codeDir}/.serverless-offline/layers'

#### localEnvironment

Copy local environment variables.

Default: false

#### noAuth

Turns off all authorizers.

#### noPrependStageInUrl

Don't prepend http routes with the stage.

#### noSponsor

Remove sponsor message from the output.

#### noTimeout

-t Disables the timeout feature.

#### prefix

-p Adds a prefix to every path, to send your requests to [http://localhost:3000/[prefix]/[your\_path]](http://localhost:3000/%5Bprefix%5D/%5Byour_path%5D) instead.

Default: ''

#### reloadHandler

Reloads handler with each request.

#### resourceRoutes

Turns on loading of your HTTP proxy settings from serverless.yml.

#### terminateIdleLambdaTime

Number of seconds until an idle function is eligible for termination.

#### useDocker

Run handlers in a docker container.

#### useInProcess

Run handlers in the same process as 'serverless-offline'.

#### webSocketHardTimeout

Set WebSocket hard timeout in seconds to reproduce AWS limits (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/limits.html#apigateway-execution-service-websocket-limits-table>).

Default: 7200 (2 hours)

#### webSocketIdleTimeout

Set WebSocket idle timeout in seconds to reproduce AWS limits (<https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/limits.html#apigateway-execution-service-websocket-limits-table>).

Default: 600 (10 minutes)

#### websocketPort

WebSocket port to listen on.

Default: 3001

#### preLoadModules

Pre-load specified modules in the main thread to avoid crashes when importing in worker threads. Provide module names as a comma-separated list (e.g., "sharp,canvas").

Default: ''

Any of the CLI options can be added to your `serverless.yml`. For example:

```
custom:
  serverless-offline:
    httpsProtocol: 'dev-certs'
    httpPort: 4000
      foo: 'bar'
```

Options passed on the command line override YAML options.

By default you can send your requests to `http://localhost:3000/`. Please note that:

* You'll need to restart the plugin if you modify your `serverless.yml` or any of the default velocity template files.
* When no Content-Type header is set on a request, API Gateway defaults to `application/json`, and so does the plugin.
  But if you send an `application/x-www-form-urlencoded` or a `multipart/form-data` body with an `application/json` (or no) Content-Type, API Gateway won't parse your data (you'll get the ugly raw as input), whereas the plugin will answer 400 (malformed JSON).
  Please consider explicitly setting your requests' Content-Type and using separate templates.

## Run modes

### node.js

Lambda handlers with `serverless-offline` for the `node.js` runtime can run in different execution modes and have some differences with a variety of pros and cons. they are currently mutually exclusive and it's not possible to use a combination, e.g. use `in-process` for one Lambda, and `worker-threads` for another. It is planned to combine the flags into one single flag in the future and also add support for combining run modes.

#### worker-threads (default)

* handlers run in their own context
* memory is not being shared between handlers, memory consumption is therefore higher
* memory is being released when handlers reload or after usage
* environment (process.env) is not being shared across handlers
* global state is not being shared across handlers
* easy debugging

NOTE:

* native modules need to be a Node-API addon or be declared as context-aware using NODE\_MODULE\_INIT(): <https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/addons.html#worker-support>

#### in-process

* handlers run in the same context (instance) as `serverless` and `serverless-offline`
* memory is being shared across lambda handlers as well as with `serverless` and `serverless-offline`
* no reloading capabilities as it is [currently] not possible to implement for commonjs handlers (without memory leaks) and for esm handlers
* environment (process.env) is being shared across handlers as well as with `serverless` and `serverless-offline`
* global state is being shared across lambda handlers as well as with `serverless` and `serverless-offline`
* easy debugging

#### docker

* handlers run in a docker container
* memory is not being shared between handlers, memory consumption is therefore higher
* memory is being released when handlers reload or after usage
* environment (process.env) is not being shared across handlers
* global state is not being shared across handlers
* debugging more complicated

### Python, Ruby, Go, Java (incl. Kotlin, Groovy, Scala)

the Lambda handler process is running in a child process.

## Invoke Lambda

To use `Lambda.invoke` you need to set the lambda endpoint to the `serverless-offline` endpoint:

```
import { env } from "node:process"
import aws from "aws-sdk"

const lambda = new aws.Lambda({
  apiVersion: "2015-03-31",
  // endpoint needs to be set only if it deviates from the default
  endpoint: env.IS_OFFLINE
    ? "http://localhost:3002"
    : "https://lambda.us-east-1.amazonaws.com",
})
```

All your lambdas can then be invoked in a handler using

```
import { Buffer } from "node:buffer"
import aws from "aws-sdk"

const { stringify } = JSON

const lambda = new aws.Lambda({
  apiVersion: "2015-03-31",
  endpoint: "http://localhost:3002",
})

export async function handler() {
  const clientContextData = stringify({
    foo: "foo",
  })

  const payload = stringify({
    data: "foo",
  })

  const params = {
    ClientContext: Buffer.from(clientContextData).toString("base64"),
    // FunctionName is composed of: service name - stage - function name, e.g.
    FunctionName: "myServiceName-dev-invokedHandler",
    InvocationType: "RequestResponse",
    Payload: payload,
  }

  const response = await lambda.invoke(params).promise()

  return {
    body: stringify(response),
    statusCode: 200,
  }
}
```

You can also invoke using the aws cli by specifying `--endpoint-url`

```
aws lambda invoke /dev/null \
  --endpoint-url http://localhost:3002 \
  --function-name myServiceName-dev-invokedHandler

```

List of available function names and their corresponding serverless.yml function keys
are listed after the server starts. This is important if you use a custom naming
scheme for your functions as `serverless-offline` will use your custom name.
The left side is the function's key in your `serverless.yml`
(`invokedHandler` in the example below) and the right side is the function name
that is used to call the function externally such as `aws-sdk`
(`myServiceName-dev-invokedHandler` in the example below):

```
serverless offline
...
offline: Starting Offline: local/us-east-1.
offline: Offline [http for lambda] listening on http://localhost:3002
offline: Function names exposed for local invocation by aws-sdk:
           * invokedHandler: myServiceName-dev-invokedHandler

```

To list the available manual invocation paths exposed for targeting
by `aws-sdk` and `aws-cli`, use `SLS_DEBUG=*` with `serverless offline`. After the invoke server starts up, full list of endpoints will be displayed:

```
SLS_DEBUG=* serverless offline
...
offline: Starting Offline: local/us-east-1.
...
offline: Offline [http for lambda] listening on http://localhost:3002
offline: Function names exposed for local invocation by aws-sdk:
           * invokedHandler: myServiceName-dev-invokedHandler
[offline] Lambda Invocation Routes (for AWS SDK or AWS CLI):
           * POST http://localhost:3002/2015-03-31/functions/myServiceName-dev-invokedHandler/invocations
[offline] Lambda Async Invocation Routes (for AWS SDK or AWS CLI):
           * POST http://localhost:3002/2014-11-13/functions/myServiceName-dev-invokedHandler/invoke-async/

```

You can manually target these endpoints with a REST client to debug your lambda
function if you want to. Your `POST` JSON body will be the `Payload` passed to your function if you were
to calling it via `aws-sdk`.

## The `process.env.IS_OFFLINE` variable

Will be `"true"` in your handlers when using `serverless-offline`.

## Docker and Layers

To use layers with serverless-offline, you need to have the `useDocker` option set to true. This can either be by using the `--useDocker` command, or in your serverless.yml like this:

```
custom:
  serverless-offline:
    useDocker: true
```

This will allow the docker container to look up any information about layers, download and use them. For this to work, you must be using:

* AWS as a provider, it won't work with other provider types.
* Layers that are compatible with your runtime.
* ARNs for layers. Local layers aren't supported as yet.
* A local AWS account set-up that can query and download layers.

If you're using least-privilege principals for your AWS roles, this policy should get you by:

```
{
  "Statement": [
    {
      "Action": "lambda:GetLayerVersion",
      "Effect": "Allow",
      "Resource": "arn:aws:lambda:*:*:layer:*:*"
    }
  ],
  "Version": "2012-10-17"
}
```

Once you run a function that boots up the Docker container, it'll look through the layers for that function, download them in order to your layers folder, and save a hash of your layers so it can be re-used in future. You'll only need to re-download your layers if they change in the future. If you want your layers to re-download, simply remove your layers folder.

You should then be able to invoke functions as normal, and they're executed against the layers in your docker container.

### Additional Options

There are 5 additional options available for Docker and Layer usage.

* dockerHost
* dockerHostServicePath
* dockerNetwork
* dockerReadOnly
* layersDir

#### dockerHost

When running Docker Lambda inside another Docker container, you may need to configure the host name for the host machine to resolve networking issues between Docker Lambda and the host. Typically in such cases you would set this to `host.docker.internal`.

#### dockerHostServicePath

When running Docker Lambda inside another Docker container, you may need to override the code path that gets mounted to the Docker Lambda container relative to the host machine. Typically in such cases you would set this to `${PWD}`.

#### dockerNetwork

When running Docker Lambda inside another Docker container, you may need to override network that Docker Lambda connects to in order to communicate with other containers.

#### dockerReadOnly

For certain programming languages and frameworks, it's desirable to be able to write to the filesystem for things like testing with local SQLite databases, or other testing-only modifications. For this, you can set `dockerReadOnly: false`, and this will allow local filesystem modifications. This does not strictly mimic AWS Lambda, as Lambda has a Read-Only filesystem, so this should be used as a last resort.

#### layersDir

By default layers are downloaded on a per-project basis, however, if you want to share them across projects, you can download them to a common place. For example, `layersDir: /tmp/layers` would allow them to be shared across projects. Make sure when using this setting that the directory you are writing layers to can be shared by docker.

## Authorizers

### Token authorizers

As defined in the [Serverless Documentation](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway/#setting-api-keys-for-your-rest-api) you can use API Keys as a simple authentication method.

Serverless-offline will emulate the behaviour of APIG and create a random token that's printed on the screen. With this token you can access your private methods adding `x-api-key: generatedToken` to your request header. All api keys will share the same token.

### Custom authorizers

Only [custom authorizers](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/compute/introducing-custom-authorizers-in-amazon-api-gateway/) are supported. Custom authorizers are executed before a Lambda function is executed and return an Error or a Policy document.

The Custom authorizer is passed an `event` object as below:

```
{
  "authorizationToken": "<Incoming bearer token>",
  "methodArn": "arn:aws:execute-api:<Region id>:<Account id>:<API id>/<Stage>/<Method>/<Resource path>",
  "type": "TOKEN"
}
```

The `methodArn` does not include the Account id or API id.

The plugin only supports retrieving Tokens from headers. You can configure the header as below:

```
"authorizer": {
  "authorizerResultTtlInSeconds": "0",
  "identitySource": "method.request.header.Authorization", // or method.request.header.SomeOtherHeader
  "type": "TOKEN"
}
```

### Remote authorizers

You are able to mock the response from remote authorizers by setting the environmental variable `AUTHORIZER` before running `sls offline start`

Example:

> Unix: `export AUTHORIZER='{"principalId": "123"}'`

> Windows: `SET AUTHORIZER='{"principalId": "123"}'`

### JWT authorizers

For HTTP APIs, [JWT authorizers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/http-api-jwt-authorizer.html)
defined in the `serverless.yml` can be used to validate the token and scopes in the token. However at this time,
the signature of the JWT is not validated with the defined issuer. Since this is a security risk, this feature is
only enabled with the `--ignoreJWTSignature` flag. Make sure to only set this flag for local development work.

### Serverless plugin authorizers

If your authentication needs are custom and not satisfied by the existing capabilities of the Serverless offline project, you can inject your own authentication strategy. To inject a custom strategy for Lambda invocation, you define a custom variable under `offline` called `customAuthenticationProvider` in the serverless.yml file. The value of the custom variable will be used to `require(your customAuthenticationProvider value)` where the location is expected to return a function with the following signature.

```
offline:
  customAuthenticationProvider: ./path/to/custom-authentication-provider
```

```
// ./path/to/customer-authentication-provider.js

module.exports = function (endpoint, functionKey, method, path) {
  return {
    getAuthenticateFunction() {
      return {
        async authenticate(request, h) {
          // your implementation
        },
      }
    },

    name: "your strategy name",
    scheme: "your scheme name",
  }
}
```

A working example of injecting a custom authorization provider can be found in the projects integration tests under the folder [`custom-authentication`](/dherault/serverless-offline/blob/master/tests/integration/custom-authentication).

## Custom headers

You are able to use some custom headers in your request to gain more control over the requestContext object.

| Header | Event key | Example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| cognito-identity-id | event.requestContext.identity.cognitoIdentityId |  |
| cognito-authentication-provider | event.requestContext.identity.cognitoAuthenticationProvider |  |
| sls-offline-authorizer-override | event.requestContext.authorizer | { "iam": {"cognitoUser": { "amr": ["unauthenticated"], "identityId": "abc123" }}} |

By doing this you are now able to change those values using a custom header. This can help you with easier authentication or retrieving the userId from a `cognitoAuthenticationProvider` value.

## Environment variables

You are able to use environment variables to customize identity params in event context.

| Environment Variable | Event key |
| --- | --- |
| SLS\_COGNITO\_IDENTITY\_POOL\_ID | event.requestContext.identity.cognitoIdentityPoolId |
| SLS\_ACCOUNT\_ID | event.requestContext.identity.accountId |
| SLS\_COGNITO\_IDENTITY\_ID | event.requestContext.identity.cognitoIdentityId |
| SLS\_CALLER | event.requestContext.identity.caller |
| SLS\_API\_KEY | event.requestContext.identity.apiKey |
| SLS\_API\_KEY\_ID | event.requestContext.identity.apiKeyId |
| SLS\_COGNITO\_AUTHENTICATION\_TYPE | event.requestContext.identity.cognitoAuthenticationType |
| SLS\_COGNITO\_AUTHENTICATION\_PROVIDER | event.requestContext.identity.cognitoAuthenticationProvider |

You can use [serverless-dotenv-plugin](https://github.com/colynb/serverless-dotenv-plugin) to load environment variables from your `.env` file.

## AWS API Gateway Features

### Velocity Templates

[Serverless doc](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway#request-templates)
~ [AWS doc](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/models-mappings.html#models-mappings-mappings)

You can supply response and request templates for each function. This is optional. To do so you will have to place function specific template files in the same directory as your function file and add the .req.vm extension to the template filename.
For example,
if your function is in code-file: `helloworld.js`,
your response template should be in file: `helloworld.res.vm` and your request template in file `helloworld.req.vm`.

#### Velocity nuances

Consider this requestTemplate for a POST endpoint:

```
"application/json": {
  "payload": "$input.json('$')",
  "id_json": "$input.json('$.id')",
  "id_path": "$input.path('$').id"
}
```

Now let's make a request with this body: `{ "id": 1 }`

AWS parses the event as such:

```
{
  "payload": {
    "id": 1
  },
  "id_json": 1,
  "id_path": "1" // Notice the string
}
```

Whereas Offline parses:

```
{
  "payload": {
    "id": 1
  },
  "id_json": 1,
  "id_path": 1 // Notice the number
}
```

Accessing an attribute after using `$input.path` will return a string on AWS (expect strings like `"1"` or `"true"`) but not with Offline (`1` or `true`).
You may find other differences.

### CORS

[Serverless doc](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway#enabling-cors)

For HTTP APIs, the CORS configuration will work out of the box. Any CLI arguments
passed in will be ignored.

For REST APIs, if the endpoint config has CORS set to true, the plugin will use the CLI CORS options for the associated route.
Otherwise, no CORS headers will be added.

### Catch-all Path Variables

[AWS doc](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/api-gateway-update-new-features-simplify-api-development/)

Set greedy paths like `/store/{proxy+}` that will intercept requests made to `/store/list-products`, `/store/add-product`, etc...

### ANY method

[AWS doc](https://aws.amazon.com/blogs/aws/api-gateway-update-new-features-simplify-api-development/)

Works out of the box.

### Lambda and Lambda Proxy Integrations

[Serverless doc](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway#lambda-proxy-integration)
~ [AWS doc](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/api-gateway-create-api-as-simple-proxy-for-lambda.html)

Works out of the box. See examples in the manual\_test directory.

### HTTP Proxy

[Serverless doc](https://serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/aws/events/apigateway#setting-an-http-proxy-on-api-gateway)
~
[AWS doc - AWS::ApiGateway::Method](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-method.html)
~
[AWS doc - AWS::ApiGateway::Resource](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/AWSCloudFormation/latest/UserGuide/aws-resource-apigateway-resource.html)

Example of enabling proxy:

```
custom:
  serverless-offline:
    resourceRoutes: true
```

or

```
    YourCloudFormationMethodId:
      Properties:
        ......
        Integration:
          Type: HTTP_PROXY
          Uri: 'https://s3-${self:custom.region}.amazonaws.com/${self:custom.yourBucketName}/{proxy}'
          ......
      Type: AWS::ApiGateway::Method
```

```
custom:
  serverless-offline:
    resourceRoutes:
      YourCloudFormationMethodId:
        Uri: "http://localhost:3001/assets/{proxy}"
```

### Response parameters

[AWS doc](http://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/request-response-data-mappings.html#mapping-response-parameters)

You can set your response's headers using ResponseParameters.

May not work properly. Please PR. (Difficulty: hard?)

Example response velocity template:

```
"responseParameters": {
  "method.response.header.X-Powered-By": "Serverless", // a string
  "method.response.header.Warning": "integration.response.body", // the whole response
  "method.response.header.Location": "integration.response.body.some.key" // a pseudo JSON-path
},
```

## WebSocket

Usage in order to send messages back to clients:

`POST http://localhost:3001/@connections/{connectionId}`

Or,

```
import aws from 'aws-sdk'

const apiGatewayManagementApi = new aws.ApiGatewayManagementApi({
  apiVersion: '2018-11-29',
  endpoint: 'http://localhost:3001',
});

apiGatewayManagementApi.postToConnection({
  ConnectionId: ...,
  Data: ...,
});
```

Where the `event` is received in the lambda handler function.

There's support for [websocketsApiRouteSelectionExpression](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/apigateway/latest/developerguide/apigateway-websocket-api-selection-expressions.html) in it's basic form: `$request.body.x.y.z`, where the default value is `$request.body.action`.

## Debug process

Serverless offline plugin will respond to the overall framework settings and output additional information to the console in debug mode. In order to do this you will have to set the `SLS_DEBUG` environmental variable. You can run the following in the command line to switch to debug mode execution.

> Unix: `export SLS_DEBUG=*`

> Windows: `SET SLS_DEBUG=*`

Interactive debugging is also possible for your project if you have installed the node-inspector module and chrome browser. You can then run the following command line inside your project's root.

Initial installation:
`npm install -g node-inspector`

For each debug run:
`node-debug sls offline`

The system will start in wait status. This will also automatically start the chrome browser and wait for you to set breakpoints for inspection. Set the breakpoints as needed and, then, click the play button for the debugging to continue.

Depending on the breakpoint, you may need to call the URL path for your function in separate browser window for your serverless function to be run and made available for debugging.

### Interactive Debugging with Visual Studio Code (VSC)

With newer versions of node (6.3+) the node inspector is already part of your node environment and you can take advantage of debugging inside your IDE with source-map support. Here is the example configuration to debug interactively with VSC. It has two steps.

#### Step 1 : Adding a launch configuration in IDE

Add a new [launch configuration](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/editor/debugging) to VSC like this:

```
{
  "cwd": "${workspaceFolder}",
  "name": "Debug Serverless Offline",
  "request": "launch",
  "runtimeArgs": ["run", "debug"],
  "runtimeExecutable": "npm",
  "sourceMaps": true,
  "type": "node"
}
```

#### Step2 : Adding a debug script

You will also need to add a `debug` script reference in your `package.json file`

Add this to the `scripts` section:

> Unix/Mac: `"debug" : "export SLS_DEBUG=* && node --inspect /usr/local/bin/serverless offline"`

> Windows: `"debug": "SET SLS_DEBUG=* && node --inspect node_modules\\serverless\\bin\\serverless offline"`

Example:

```
....
"scripts": {
  "debug" : "SET SLS_DEBUG=* && node --inspect node_modules\\serverless\\bin\\serverless offline"
}
```

In VSC, you can, then, add breakpoints to your code. To start a debug sessions you can either start your script in `package.json` by clicking the hovering debug intellisense icon or by going to your debug pane and selecting the Debug Serverless Offline configuration.

## Resource permissions and AWS profile

Lambda functions assume an IAM role during execution: the framework creates this role and set all the permission provided in the `iamRoleStatements` section of `serverless.yml`.

However, serverless offline makes use of your local AWS profile credentials to run the lambda functions and that might result in a different set of permissions. By default, the aws-sdk would load credentials for you default AWS profile specified in your configuration file.

You can change this profile directly in the code or by setting proper environment variables. Setting the `AWS_PROFILE` environment variable before calling `serverless` offline to a different profile would effectively change the credentials, e.g.

`AWS_PROFILE=<profile> serverless offline`

## Simulation quality

This plugin simulates API Gateway for many practical purposes, good enough for development - but is not a perfect simulator.
Specifically, Lambda currently runs on Node.js v12.x, v14.x and v16.x ([AWS Docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/lambda/latest/dg/current-supported-versions.html)), whereas *Offline* runs on your own runtime where no memory limits are enforced.

## Usage with other plugins

When combining this plugin with other plugins there are a few things that you need to keep in mind.

You should run `serverless offline start` instead of `serverless offline`. The `start` command fires the `offline:start:init` and `offline:start:end` lifecycle hooks which can be used by other plugins to process your code, add resources, perform cleanups, etc.

The order in which plugins are added to `serverless.yml` is relevant.
Plugins are executed in order, so plugins that process your code or add resources should be added first so they are ready when this plugin starts.

For example:

```
plugins:
  - serverless-middleware # modifies some of your handler based on configuration
  - serverless-webpack # package your javascript handlers using webpack
  - serverless-dynamodb # adds a local dynamo db
  - serverless-offline # runs last so your code has been pre-processed and dynamo is ready
```

That works because all those plugins listen to the `offline:start:init` to do their processing.
Similarly they listen to `offline:start:end` to perform cleanup (stop dynamo db, remove temporary files, etc).
