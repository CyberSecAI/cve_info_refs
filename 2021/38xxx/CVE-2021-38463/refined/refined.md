The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38463.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The affected product does not properly control the allocation of resources, specifically memory buffers allocated using API functions.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Uncontrolled Resource Consumption (CWE-400). The software allows a user to allocate unlimited memory buffers using API functions.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could potentially exhaust system resources leading to a denial-of-service condition.

**Attack vectors:**
Network-based, using the affected product's API functions.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker with network access to the affected system and the ability to interact with its API can exploit this vulnerability by sending requests to allocate large amount of memory. The attacker needs to be a user with the ability to use the API.
