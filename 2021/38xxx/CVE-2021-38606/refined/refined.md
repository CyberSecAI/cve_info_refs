Based on the provided diff, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way the application generates and stores scan results directories. Originally, the directory names were predictable, based on the domain name and timestamp. This was changed to use random integers, which is intended to make directory names unpredictable. However, in the code that deletes scan results, the application uses two different ways to determine the directory name.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

*   **Inconsistent Directory Deletion:** The application uses two different methods to construct the path to the scan results directory when deleting scan data:
    *   One method constructs the directory name based on `domain.name` and a formatted `start_scan_date`.
    *   The other method uses the `results_dir` which, after the fix in the commit, is based on a random integer.
    *   This inconsistency causes the application to fail to delete the correct directory when the older method is used.
*   **OS Command Injection:** The code uses `os.system('rm -rf ' + delete_path)` and `os.system('rm -rf /usr/src/scan_results/' + delete_dir)` which is vulnerable to OS command injection if the `delete_path` or `delete_dir` variables are not properly sanitized or validated. This is particularly problematic because `delete_dir` is a string read directly from the database, and could be modified maliciously.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
*   **File Deletion Issues:** Legitimate scan data may not be deleted as expected.
*   **Potential Arbitrary File Deletion:** Due to the OS command injection vulnerability, a malicious attacker could potentially inject arbitrary shell commands and delete other files/directories outside of the expected scan results directory if the `delete_path` or `delete_dir` variables are not sanitized. This could lead to data loss or compromise system integrity.
*   **Denial of Service:** A malicious attacker could use this to cause a denial of service by deleting essential system files.

**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Direct Request Modification:** An attacker could potentially try to modify the scan data, especially `obj.results_dir` or related values in database, to control the directory deletion process.
*   **Database Manipulation:** An attacker with access to the database could modify the `results_dir` value associated with a scan, which would then be used in the `os.system` call when deleting a scan, enabling arbitrary file deletion.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Authenticated Access:** The attacker needs to have some form of authenticated access to the web application or underlying database to manipulate the data used in the vulnerable functionality.
*   **Understanding the Code:** The attacker needs to understand how the application constructs and uses directory paths to exploit the command injection and inconsistent path handling.
