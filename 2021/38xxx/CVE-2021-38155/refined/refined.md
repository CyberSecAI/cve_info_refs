By guessing the name of an account\n    and failing to authenticate multiple times, any unauthenticated actor\n    could both confirm the account exists and obtain that account's\n    corresponding UUID, which might be leveraged for other unrelated\n    attacks. All deployments enabling\n    security_compliance.lockout_failure_attempts are affected.",

          "Root cause": "Keystone's account locking mechanism, related to PCI DSS features, exposed user existence and UUID information through error messages when a user account is locked due to multiple failed authentication attempts.",

If someone can guess a username they can prevent that user from authenticating by repeatedly attempting to log in with an incorrect credential.\n\n2. Someone can identify valid usernames by trying to log in with candidate strings with invalid passwords until the lock out is reached, at which point the change in API response confirms the existence of that user.\n\n3. The lock out response can be used as an oracle to determine the UUID matching any known or guessed username.",
