- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Missing "secure" attribute in cookies.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The application is setting cookies without the "secure" attribute.
- **Impact of exploitation:**  The vulnerability could allow an attacker to potentially intercept the cookie when the communication is not encrypted (e.g., over HTTP). This could lead to unauthorized access or impersonation, depending on the sensitivity of the data in the cookie.
- **Attack vectors:**  Man-in-the-middle attacks on unencrypted connections (HTTP).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be positioned on the network to intercept unencrypted network traffic (e.g., an attacker on the same network as a user using HTTP or an attacker who can force a user to use HTTP), and capture the insecurely set cookies.
