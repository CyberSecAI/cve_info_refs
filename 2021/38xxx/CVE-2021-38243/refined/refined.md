Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability stems from the way XunRuicms version 4.5.1 (and earlier) handles GET request parameters, specifically within the `api`, `template`, and `admin` contexts. The application is directly using the parameters to construct a function call without proper sanitization or validation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The primary weakness is the ability to execute arbitrary code on the server by crafting a specific URL.
- **Insecure Parameter Handling:** The application fails to properly sanitize input parameters used to build function calls, allowing for the injection of malicious parameters and execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can gain complete control of the server, leading to potential data theft, system compromise, and other malicious activities. The example given demonstrates running `calc`, which means any system command is possible.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Requests:** The attack vector is via a specially crafted HTTP GET request. Specifically, the `s=api&c=api&m=template&app=admin&name=api_related.html&phpcmf_dir=admin&mid= action=function name=system param0=calc` set of parameters.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker only needs network access to the vulnerable XunRuicms instance to send the malicious GET request.
- **No Authentication Needed:** The provided example implies that no prior authentication is required to trigger the RCE, meaning this can be exploited by any anonymous user.

**Additional Information:**
- The vulnerability was discovered by "Jiang".
- The vendor patched the vulnerability in a commit referenced in the report: <https://gitee.com/dayrui/xunruicms/commit/80e2d8f3008384d926c64163b7334a260edc0a51>
-  The report suggests that not all users have updated to the patched version, so vulnerable instances may still be present on the internet.
