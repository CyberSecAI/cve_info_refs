  "CVE-2021-38198": {
    "description": "A flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for x86 processors, that could result in virtual memory protection within a guest not being applied correctly. When shadow page tables are used - i.e. for nested virtualisation, or on CPUs lacking the EPT or NPT feature - a user of the guest OS might be able to exploit this for denial of service or privilege escalation within the guest.",
    "root cause": "Incorrect handling of virtual memory protection when shadow page tables are used, specifically when nested virtualization is enabled or on CPUs lacking EPT or NPT features.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper application of virtual memory protection within a guest OS.",
      "Flaw in KVM implementation for x86 processors."
    ],
    "impact": "A user of the guest OS could potentially achieve denial of service or privilege escalation within the guest.",
    "attack vector": "Exploitation occurs from within the guest OS.",
        "required_capabilities": "User of guest OS. Vulnerability is triggered by specific memory access patterns with missing memory protections from the KVM hypervisor."
