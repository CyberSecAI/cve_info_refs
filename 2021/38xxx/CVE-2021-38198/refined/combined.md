                 CVE-2021-38199 CVE-2021-38205 CVE-2021-40490

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-3702

    A flaw was found in the driver for Atheros IEEE 802.11n family of
    chipsets (ath9k) allowing information disclosure.

CVE-2020-16119

    Hadar Manor reported a use-after-free in the DCCP protocol
    implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially
    to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-3444, CVE-2021-3600

    Two flaws were discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF) verifier.  A
    local user could exploit these to read and write arbitrary memory
    in the kernel, which could be used for privilege escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-3612

    Murray McAllister reported a flaw in the joystick input subsystem.
    A local user permitted to access a joystick device could exploit
    this to read and write out-of-bounds in the kernel, which could
    be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3653

   Maxim Levitsky discovered a vulnerability in the KVM hypervisor
   implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel: Missing
   validation of the `int_ctl` VMCB field could allow a malicious L1
   guest to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt
   Controller) for the L2 guest. The L2 guest can take advantage of
   this flaw to write to a limited but still relatively large subset
   of the host physical memory.

CVE-2021-3655

    Ilja Van Sprundel and Marcelo Ricardo Leitner found multiple flaws
    in the SCTP implementation, where missing validation could lead to
    an out-of-bounds read.  On a system using SCTP, a networked
    attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3656

    Maxim Levitsky and Paolo Bonzini discovered a flaw in the KVM
    hypervisor implementation for AMD processors in the Linux
    kernel. Missing validation of the `virt_ext` VMCB field could
    allow a malicious L1 guest to disable both VMLOAD/VMSAVE
    intercepts and VLS (Virtual VMLOAD/VMSAVE) for the L2 guest. Under
    these circumstances, the L2 guest is able to run VMLOAD/VMSAVE
    unintercepted and thus read/write portions of the host's physical
    memory.

CVE-2021-3679

    A flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could
    allow a privileged local user (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) to
    cause a denial of service (resource starvation).

CVE-2021-3732

    Alois Wohlschlager reported a flaw in the implementation of the
    overlayfs subsystem, allowing a local attacker with privileges to
    mount a filesystem to reveal files hidden in the original mount.

CVE-2021-3743

    An out-of-bounds memory read was discovered in the Qualcomm IPC
    router protocol implementation, allowing to cause a denial of
    service or information leak.

CVE-2021-3753

    Minh Yuan reported a race condition in the vt_k_ioctl in
    drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c, which may cause an out of bounds read
    in vt.

CVE-2021-22543

    David Stevens discovered a flaw in how the KVM hypervisor maps
    host memory into a guest.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/kvm could use this to cause certain pages to be freed when
    they should not, leading to a use-after-free.  This could be used
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-33624, CVE-2021-34556, CVE-2021-35477

    Multiple researchers discovered flaws in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    verifier's protections against information leaks through
    speculation execution.  A local user could exploit these to read
    sensitive information.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-35039

    A flaw was discovered in module signature enforcement.  A custom
    kernel with IMA enabled might have allowed loading unsigned kernel
    modules when it should not have.

CVE-2021-37159

    A flaw was discovered in the hso driver for Option mobile
    broadband modems.  An error during initialisation could lead to a
    double-free or use-after-free.  An attacker able to plug in USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-38160

    A flaw in the virtio_console was discovered allowing data
    corruption or data loss by an untrusted device.

CVE-2021-38198

    A flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors, that could result in virtual memory protection within
    a guest not being applied correctly.  When shadow page tables are
    used - i.e. for nested virtualisation, or on CPUs lacking the EPT
    or NPT feature - a user of the guest OS might be able to exploit
    this for denial of service or privilege escalation within the
    guest.

CVE-2021-38199

    Michael Wakabayashi reported a flaw in the NFSv4 client
    implementation, where incorrect connection setup ordering allows
    operations of a remote NFSv4 server to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-38205

    An information leak was discovered in the xilinx_emaclite network
    driver.  On a custom kernel where this driver is enabled and used,
    this might make it easier to exploit other kernel bugs.

CVE-2021-40490

    A race condition was discovered in the ext4 subsystem when writing
    to an inline_data file while its xattrs are changing. This could
    result in denial of service.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.19.208-1~deb9u1.

proc: only require mm\_struct for writing
commit 94f0b2d4a1d0c52035aef425da5e022bd2cb1c71 upstream.
Commit 591a22c14d3f ("proc: Track /proc/$pid/attr/ opener mm\_struct") we
started using \_\_mem\_open() to track the mm\_struct at open-time, so that
we could then check it for writes.
But that also ended up making the permission checks at open time much
stricter - and not just for writes, but for reads too. And that in turn
caused a regression for at least Fedora 29, where NIC interfaces fail to
start when using NetworkManager.
Since only the write side wanted the mm\_struct test, ignore any failures
by \_\_mem\_open() at open time, leaving reads unaffected. The write()
time verification of the mm\_struct pointer will then catch the failure
case because a NULL pointer will not match a valid 'current->mm'.

scsi: core: Put .shost\_dev in failure path if host state changes to RUNNING
commit 11714026c02d613c30a149c3f4c4a15047744529 upstream.
scsi\_host\_dev\_release() only frees dev\_name when host state is
SHOST\_CREATED. After host state has changed to SHOST\_RUNNING,
scsi\_host\_dev\_release() no longer cleans up.
Fix this by doing a put\_device(&shost->shost\_dev) in the failure path when
host state is SHOST\_RUNNING. Move get\_device(&shost->shost\_gendev) before
device\_add(&shost->shost\_dev) so that scsi\_host\_cls\_release() can do a put
on this reference.

scsi: core: Fix failure handling of scsi\_add\_host\_with\_dma()
commit 3719f4ff047e20062b8314c23ec3cab84d74c908 upstream.
When scsi\_add\_host\_with\_dma() returns failure, the caller will call
scsi\_host\_put(shost) to release everything allocated for this host
instance. Consequently we can't also free allocated stuff in
scsi\_add\_host\_with\_dma(), otherwise we will end up with a double free.
Strictly speaking, host resource allocations should have been done in
scsi\_host\_alloc(). However, the allocations may need information which is
not yet provided by the driver when that function is called. So leave the
allocations where they are but rely on host device's release handler to
free resources.

scsi: core: Fix error handling of scsi\_host\_alloc()
commit 66a834d092930cf41d809c0e989b13cd6f9ca006 upstream.
After device is initialized via device\_initialize(), or its name is set via
dev\_set\_name(), the device has to be freed via put\_device(). Otherwise
device name will be leaked because it is allocated dynamically in
dev\_set\_name().
Fix the leak by replacing kfree() with put\_device(). Since
scsi\_host\_dev\_release() properly handles IDA and kthread removal, remove
special-casing these from the error handling as well.

NFSv4: nfs4\_proc\_set\_acl needs to restore NFS\_CAP\_UIDGID\_NOMAP on error.
commit f8849e206ef52b584cd9227255f4724f0cc900bb upstream.
Currently if \_\_nfs4\_proc\_set\_acl fails with NFS4ERR\_BADOWNER it
re-enables the idmapper by clearing NFS\_CAP\_UIDGID\_NOMAP before
retrying again. The NFS\_CAP\_UIDGID\_NOMAP remains cleared even if
the retry fails. This causes problem for subsequent setattr
requests for v4 server that does not have idmapping configured.
This patch modifies nfs4\_proc\_set\_acl to detect NFS4ERR\_BADOWNER
and NFS4ERR\_BADNAME and skips the retry, since the kernel isn't
involved in encoding the ACEs, and return -EINVAL.
Steps to reproduce the problem:
# mount -o vers=4.1,sec=sys server:/export/test /tmp/mnt
# touch /tmp/mnt/file1
# chown 99 /tmp/mnt/file1
# nfs4\_setfacl -a A::unknown.user@xyz.com:wrtncy /tmp/mnt/file1
Failed setxattr operation: Invalid argument
# chown 99 /tmp/mnt/file1
chown: changing ownership of ‘/tmp/mnt/file1’: Invalid argument
# umount /tmp/mnt
# mount -o vers=4.1,sec=sys server:/export/test /tmp/mnt
# chown 99 /tmp/mnt/file1

KASAN reports a use-after-free when attempting to mount two different
exports through two different NICs that belong to the same server.
Olga was able to hit this with kernels starting somewhere between 5.7

4.13. So something must have changed in the refcounting of the clp
pointer to make this call to nfs\_put\_client() the very last one.

perf session: Correct buffer copying when peeking events
[ Upstream commit 197eecb6ecae0b04bd694432f640ff75597fed9c ]
When peeking an event, it has a short path and a long path. The short
path uses the session pointer "one\_mmap\_addr" to directly fetch the
event; and the long path needs to read out the event header and the
following event data from file and fill into the buffer pointer passed
through the argument "buf".
The issue is in the long path that it copies the event header and event
data into the same destination address which pointer "buf", this means
the event header is overwritten. We are just lucky to run into the
short path in most cases, so we don't hit the issue in the long path.
This patch adds the offset "hdr\_sz" to the pointer "buf" when copying
the event data, so that it can reserve the event header which can be
used properly by its caller.

NFSv4: Fix deadlock between nfs4\_evict\_inode() and nfs4\_opendata\_get\_inode()
[ Upstream commit dfe1fe75e00e4c724ede7b9e593f6f680e446c5f ]
If the inode is being evicted, but has to return a delegation first,
then it can cause a deadlock in the corner case where the server reboots
before the delegreturn completes, but while the call to iget5\_locked() in
nfs4\_opendata\_get\_inode() is waiting for the inode free to complete.
Since the open call still holds a session slot, the reboot recovery
cannot proceed.
In order to break the logjam, we can turn the delegation return into a
privileged operation for the case where we're evicting the inode. We
know that in that case, there can be no other state recovery operation
that conflicts.

IB/mlx5: Fix initializing CQ fragments buffer
commit 2ba0aa2feebda680ecfc3c552e867cf4d1b05a3a upstream.
The function init\_cq\_frag\_buf() can be called to initialize the current CQ
fragments buffer cq->buf, or the temporary cq->resize\_buf that is filled
during CQ resize operation.
However, the offending commit started to use function get\_cqe() for
getting the CQEs, the issue with this change is that get\_cqe() always
returns CQEs from cq->buf, which leads us to initialize the wrong buffer,
and in case of enlarging the CQ we try to access elements beyond the size

KVM: x86: Ensure liveliness of nested VM-Enter fail tracepoint message
commit f31500b0d437a2464ca5972d8f5439e156b74960 upstream.
Use the \_\_string() machinery provided by the tracing subystem to make a
copy of the string literals consumed by the "nested VM-Enter failed"
tracepoint. A complete copy is necessary to ensure that the tracepoint
can't outlive the data/memory it consumes and deference stale memory.
Because the tracepoint itself is defined by kvm, if kvm-intel and/or
kvm-amd are built as modules, the memory holding the string literals
defined by the vendor modules will be freed when the module is unloaded,
whereas the tracepoint and its data in the ring buffer will live until
kvm is unloaded (or "indefinitely" if kvm is built-in).
This bug has existed since the tracepoint was added, but was recently
exposed by a new check in tracing to detect exactly this type of bug.

x86/nmi\_watchdog: Fix old-style NMI watchdog regression on old Intel CPUs
commit a8383dfb2138742a1bb77b481ada047aededa2ba upstream.
The following commit:
3a4ac121c2ca ("x86/perf: Add hardware performance events support for Zhaoxin CPU.")
Got the old-style NMI watchdog logic wrong and broke it for basically every
Intel CPU where it was active. Which is only truly old CPUs, so few people noticed.
On CPUs with perf events support we turn off the old-style NMI watchdog, so it
was pretty pointless to add the logic for X86\_VENDOR\_ZHAOXIN to begin with ... :-/
Anyway, the fix is to restore the old logic and add a 'break'.

platform/surface: aggregator: Fix event disable function
commit b430e1d65ef6eeee42c4e53028f8dfcc6abc728b upstream.
Disabling events silently fails due to the wrong command ID being used.
Instead of the command ID for the disable call, the command ID for the
enable call was being used. This causes the disable call to enable the
event instead. As the event is already enabled when we call this
function, the EC silently drops this command and does nothing.
Use the correct command ID for disabling the event to fix this.

sched/fair: Fix util\_est UTIL\_AVG\_UNCHANGED handling
commit 68d7a190682aa4eb02db477328088ebad15acc83 upstream.
The util\_est internal UTIL\_AVG\_UNCHANGED flag which is used to prevent
unnecessary util\_est updates uses the LSB of util\_est.enqueued. It is
exposed via \_task\_util\_est() (and task\_util\_est()).
Commit 92a801e5d5b7 ("sched/fair: Mask UTIL\_AVG\_UNCHANGED usages")
mentions that the LSB is lost for util\_est resolution but
find\_energy\_efficient\_cpu() checks if task\_util\_est() returns 0 to
return prev\_cpu early.
\_task\_util\_est() returns the max value of util\_est.ewma and
util\_est.enqueued or'ed w/ UTIL\_AVG\_UNCHANGED.
So task\_util\_est() returning the max of task\_util() and
\_task\_util\_est() will never return 0 under the default
SCHED\_FEAT(UTIL\_EST, true).
To fix this use the MSB of util\_est.enqueued instead and keep the flag
util\_est internal, i.e. don't export it via \_task\_util\_est().
The maximal possible util\_avg value for a task is 1024 so the MSB of
'unsigned int util\_est.enqueued' isn't used to store a util value.
As a caveat the code behind the util\_est\_se trace point has to filter
UTIL\_AVG\_UNCHANGED to see the real util\_est.enqueued value which should
be easy to do.
This also fixes an issue report by Xuewen Yan that util\_est\_update()
only used UTIL\_AVG\_UNCHANGED for the subtrahend of the equation:
last\_enqueued\_diff = ue.enqueued - (task\_util() | UTIL\_AVG\_UNCHANGED)

perf/x86/intel/uncore: Fix a kernel WARNING triggered by maxcpus=1
commit 4a0e3ff30980b7601b13dd3b7ee275212b852843 upstream.
A kernel WARNING may be triggered when setting maxcpus=1.
The uncore counters are Die-scope. When probing a PCI device, only the
BUS information can be retrieved. The uncore driver has to maintain a
mapping table used to calculate the logical Die ID from a given BUS#.
Before the patch ba9506be4e40, the mapping table stores the mapping
information from the BUS# -> a Physical Socket ID. To calculate the
logical die ID, perf does,
- In snbep\_pci2phy\_map\_init(), retrieve the BUS# -> a Physical Socket ID
from the UBOX PCI configure space.
- Calculate the mapping information (a BUS# -> a Physical Socket ID) for
the other PCI BUS.
- In the uncore\_pci\_probe(), get the physical Socket ID from a given BUS
and the mapping table.
- Calculate the logical Die ID
Since only the logical Die ID is required, with the patch ba9506be4e40,
the mapping table stores the mapping information from the BUS# -> a
logical Die ID. Now perf does,
- In snbep\_pci2phy\_map\_init(), retrieve the BUS# -> a Physical Socket ID
from the UBOX PCI configure space.
- Calculate the logical Die ID
- Calculate the mapping information (a BUS# -> a logical Die ID) for the
other PCI BUS.
- In the uncore\_pci\_probe(), get the logical die ID from a given BUS and
the mapping table.
When calculating the logical Die ID, -1 may be returned, especially when
maxcpus=1. Here, -1 means the logical Die ID is not found. But when
calculating the mapping information for the other PCI BUS, -1 indicates
that it's the other PCI BUS that requires the calculation of the
mapping. The driver will mistakenly do the calculation.
Uses the -ENODEV to indicate the case which the logical Die ID is not
found. The driver will not mess up the mapping table anymore.

The reason is that the sound-dai phandle provided has cells, and in such
case the schema should use 'phandle-array' instead of 'phandle'.

vmlinux.lds.h: Avoid orphan section with !SMP
commit d4c6399900364facd84c9e35ce1540b6046c345f upstream.
With x86\_64\_defconfig and the following configs, there is an orphan
section warning:
CONFIG\_SMP=n
CONFIG\_AMD\_MEM\_ENCRYPT=y
CONFIG\_HYPERVISOR\_GUEST=y
CONFIG\_KVM=y
CONFIG\_PARAVIRT=y
ld: warning: orphan section `.data..decrypted' from `arch/x86/kernel/cpu/vmware.o' being placed in section `.data..decrypted'
ld: warning: orphan section `.data..decrypted' from `arch/x86/kernel/kvm.o' being placed in section `.data..decrypted'
These sections are created with DEFINE\_PER\_CPU\_DECRYPTED, which
ultimately turns into \_\_PCPU\_ATTRS, which in turn has a section
attribute with a value of PER\_CPU\_BASE\_SECTION + the section name. When
CONFIG\_SMP is not set, the base section is .data and that is not
currently handled in any linker script.
Add .data..decrypted to PERCPU\_DECRYPTED\_SECTION, which is included in
PERCPU\_INPUT -> PERCPU\_SECTION, which is include in the x86 linker
script when either CONFIG\_X86\_64 or CONFIG\_SMP is unset, taking care of
the warning.

RDMA/mlx4: Do not map the core\_clock page to user space unless enabled
commit 404e5a12691fe797486475fe28cc0b80cb8bef2c upstream.
Currently when mlx4 maps the hca\_core\_clock page to the user space there
are read-modifiable registers, one of which is semaphore, on this page as
well as the clock counter. If user reads the wrong offset, it can modify
the semaphore and hang the device.
Do not map the hca\_core\_clock page to the user space unless the device has
been put in a backwards compatibility mode to support this feature.
After this patch, mlx4 core\_clock won't be mapped to user space on the
majority of existing devices and the uverbs device time feature in
ibv\_query\_rt\_values\_ex() will be disabled.

RDMA/ipoib: Fix warning caused by destroying non-initial netns

hwmon: (tps23861) set current shunt value
commit b325d3526e14942d42c392c2ac9fbea59c22894c upstream.
TPS23861 has a configuration bit for setting of the
current shunt value used on the board.
Its bit 0 of the General Mask 1 register.
According to the datasheet bit values are:
0 for 255 mOhm (Default)
1 for 250 mOhm
So, configure the bit before registering the hwmon
device according to the value passed in the DTS or
default one if none is passed.
This caused potentially reading slightly skewed values
due to max current value being 1.02A when 250mOhm shunt
is used instead of 1.0A when 255mOhm is used.

drm/msm/a6xx: update/fix CP\_PROTECT initialization
commit 408434036958699a7f50ddec984f7ba33e11a8f5 upstream.
Update CP\_PROTECT register programming based on downstream.
A6XX\_PROTECT\_RW is renamed to A6XX\_PROTECT\_NORDWR to make things aligned
and also be more clear about what it does.
Note that this required switching to use the CP\_ALWAYS\_ON\_COUNTER as the
GMU counter is not accessible from the cmdstream. Which also means
using the CPU counter for the msm\_gpu\_submit\_flush() tracepoint (as
catapult depends on being able to compare this to the start/end values
captured in cmdstream). This may need to be revisited when IFPC is
enabled.
Also, compared to downstream, this opens up CP\_PERFCTR\_CP\_SEL as the
userspace performance tooling (fdperf and pps-producer) expect to be
able to configure the CP counters.

drm/mcde: Fix off by 10^3 in calculation
commit c8a570443943304cac2e4186dbce6989b6c2b8b5 upstream.
The calclulation of how many bytes we stuff into the
DSI pipeline for video mode panels is off by three
orders of magnitude because we did not account for the
fact that the DRM mode clock is in kilohertz rather
than hertz.
This used to be:
drm\_mode\_vrefresh(mode) \* mode->htotal \* mode->vtotal
which would become for example for s6e63m0:
60 x 514 x 831 = 25628040 Hz, but mode->clock is
25628 as it is in kHz.
This affects only the Samsung GT-I8190 "Golden" phone
right now since it is the only MCDE device with a video
mode display.
Curiously some specimen work with this code and wild
settings in the EOL and empty packets at the end of the
display, but I have noticed an eeire flicker until now.
Others were not so lucky and got black screens.

usb: typec: tcpm: Fix misuses of AMS invocation
commit 80137c18737c30d20ee630e442405236d96898a7 upstream.
tcpm\_ams\_start is used to initiate an AMS as well as checking Collision
Avoidance conditions but not for flagging passive AMS (initiated by the
port partner). Fix the misuses of tcpm\_ams\_start in tcpm\_pd\_svdm.
ATTENTION doesn't need responses so the AMS flag is not needed here.

usb: typec: tcpm: Correct the responses in SVDM Version 2.0 DFP
commit f41bfc7e9c7c1d721c8752f1853cde43e606ad43 upstream.
In USB PD Spec Rev 3.1 Ver 1.0, section "6.12.5 Applicability of
Structured VDM Commands", DFP is allowed and recommended to respond to
Discovery Identity with ACK. And in section "6.4.4.2.5.1 Commands other
than Attention", NAK should be returned only when receiving Messages
with invalid fields, Messages in wrong situation, or unrecognize
Messages.
Still keep the original design for SVDM Version 1.0 for backward
compatibilities.

usb: dwc3: gadget: Disable gadget IRQ during pullup disable
commit 8212937305f84ef73ea81036dafb80c557583d4b upstream.
Current sequence utilizes dwc3\_gadget\_disable\_irq() alongside
synchronize\_irq() to ensure that no further DWC3 events are generated.
However, the dwc3\_gadget\_disable\_irq() API only disables device
specific events. Endpoint events can still be generated. Briefly
disable the interrupt line, so that the cleanup code can run to
prevent device and endpoint events. (i.e. \_\_dwc3\_gadget\_stop() and
dwc3\_stop\_active\_transfers() respectively)
Without doing so, it can lead to both the interrupt handler and the
pullup disable routine both writing to the GEVNTCOUNT register, which
will cause an incorrect count being read from future interrupts.

regulator: bd718x7: Fix the BUCK7 voltage setting on BD71837
commit bc537e65b09a05923f98a31920d1ab170e648dba upstream.
Changing the BD71837 voltages for other regulators except the first 4 BUCKs
should be forbidden when the regulator is enabled. There may be out-of-spec
voltage spikes if the voltage of these "non DVS" bucks is changed when
enabled. This restriction was accidentally removed when the LDO voltage
change was allowed for BD71847. (It was not noticed that the BD71837
BUCK7 used same voltage setting function as LDOs).
Additionally this bug causes incorrect voltage monitoring register access.
The voltage change function accidentally used for bd71837 BUCK7 is
intended to only handle LDO voltage changes. A BD71847 LDO specific
voltage monitoring disabling code gets executed on BD71837 and register
offsets are wrongly calculated as regulator is assumed to be an LDO.
Prevent the BD71837 BUCK7 voltage change when BUCK7 is enabled by using
the correct voltage setting operation.

usb: typec: tcpm: Properly handle Alert and Status Messages
commit 063933f47a7af01650af9c4fbcc5831f1c4eb7d9 upstream.
When receiving Alert Message, if it is not unexpected but is
unsupported for some reason, the port should return Not\_Supported
Message response.
Also, according to PD3.0 Spec 6.5.2.1.4 Event Flags Field, the
OTP/OVP/OCP flags in the Event Flags field in Status Message no longer
require Get\_PPS\_Status Message to clear them. Thus remove it when
receiving Status Message with those flags being set.
In addition, add the missing AMS operations for Status Message.

usb: fix various gadget panics on 10gbps cabling
commit 032e288097a553db5653af552dd8035cd2a0ba96 upstream.
usb\_assign\_descriptors() is called with 5 parameters,
the last 4 of which are the usb\_descriptor\_header for:
full-speed (USB1.1 - 12Mbps [including USB1.0 low-speed @ 1.5Mbps),
high-speed (USB2.0 - 480Mbps),
super-speed (USB3.0 - 5Gbps),
super-speed-plus (USB3.1 - 10Gbps).
The differences between full/high/super-speed descriptors are usually
substantial (due to changes in the maximum usb block size from 64 to 512
to 1024 bytes and other differences in the specs), while the difference
between 5 and 10Gbps descriptors may be as little as nothing
(in many cases the same tuning is simply good enough).
However if a gadget driver calls usb\_assign\_descriptors() with
a NULL descriptor for super-speed-plus and is then used on a max 10gbps
configuration, the kernel will crash with a null pointer dereference,
when a 10gbps capable device port + cable + host port combination shows up.
(This wouldn't happen if the gadget max-speed was set to 5gbps, but
it of course defaults to the maximum, and there's no real reason to
artificially limit it)
The fix is to simply use the 5gbps descriptor as the 10gbps descriptor,
if a 10gbps descriptor wasn't provided.
Obviously this won't fix the problem if the 5gbps descriptor is also
NULL, but such cases can't be so trivially solved (and any such gadgets
are unlikely to be used with USB3 ports any way).

USB: serial: cp210x: fix CP2102N-A01 modem control
commit 63a8eef70ccb5199534dec56fed9759d214bfe55 upstream.
CP2102N revision A01 (firmware version <= 1.0.4) has a buggy
flow-control implementation that uses the ulXonLimit instead of
ulFlowReplace field of the flow-control settings structure (erratum
CP2102N\_E104).
A recent change that set the input software flow-control limits
incidentally broke RTS control for these devices when CRTSCTS is not set
as the new limits would always enable hardware flow control.
Fix this by explicitly disabling flow control for the buggy firmware
versions and only updating the input software flow-control limits when
IXOFF is requested. This makes sure that the terminal settings matches
the default zero ulXonLimit (ulFlowReplace) for these devices.

usb: gadget: f\_fs: Ensure io\_completion\_wq is idle during unbind
commit 6fc1db5e6211e30fbb1cee8d7925d79d4ed2ae14 upstream.
During unbind, ffs\_func\_eps\_disable() will be executed, resulting in
completion callbacks for any pending USB requests. When using AIO,
irrespective of the completion status, io\_data work is queued to
io\_completion\_wq to evaluate and handle the completed requests. Since
work runs asynchronously to the unbind() routine, there can be a
scenario where the work runs after the USB gadget has been fully
removed, resulting in accessing of a resource which has been already
freed. (i.e. usb\_ep\_free\_request() accessing the USB ep structure)
Explicitly drain the io\_completion\_wq, instead of relying on the
destroy\_workqueue() (in ffs\_data\_put()) to make sure no pending
completion work items are running.

usb: typec: ucsi: Clear PPM capability data in ucsi\_init() error path
commit f247f0a82a4f8c3bfed178d8fd9e069d1424ee4e upstream.
If ucsi\_init() fails for some reason (e.g. ucsi\_register\_port()
fails or general communication failure to the PPM), particularly at
any point after the GET\_CAPABILITY command had been issued, this
results in unwinding the initialization and returning an error.
However the ucsi structure's ucsi\_capability member retains its
current value, including likely a non-zero num\_connectors.
And because ucsi\_init() itself is done in a workqueue a UCSI
interface driver will be unaware that it failed and may think the
ucsi\_register() call was completely successful. Later, if
ucsi\_unregister() is called, due to this stale ucsi->cap value it
would try to access the items in the ucsi->connector array which
might not be in a proper state or not even allocated at all and
results in NULL or invalid pointer dereference.
Fix this by clearing the ucsi->cap value to 0 during the error
path of ucsi\_init() in order to prevent a later ucsi\_unregister()
from entering the connector cleanup loop.

usb: musb: fix MUSB\_QUIRK\_B\_DISCONNECT\_99 handling
commit b65ba0c362be665192381cc59e3ac3ef6f0dd1e1 upstream.
In commit 92af4fc6ec33 ("usb: musb: Fix suspend with devices
connected for a64"), the logic to support the
MUSB\_QUIRK\_B\_DISCONNECT\_99 quirk was modified to only conditionally
schedule the musb->irq\_work delayed work.
This commit badly breaks ECM Gadget on AM335X. Indeed, with this
commit, one can observe massive packet loss:
$ ping 192.168.0.100
...
15 packets transmitted, 3 received, 80% packet loss, time 14316ms
Reverting this commit brings back a properly functioning ECM
Gadget. An analysis of the commit seems to indicate that a mistake was
made: the previous code was not falling through into the
MUSB\_QUIRK\_B\_INVALID\_VBUS\_91, but now it is, unless the condition is
taken.
Changing the logic to be as it was before the problematic commit \*and\*
only conditionally scheduling musb->irq\_work resolves the regression:
$ ping 192.168.0.100
...
64 packets transmitted, 64 received, 0% packet loss, time 64475ms

usb: pci-quirks: disable D3cold on xhci suspend for s2idle on AMD Renoir
commit d1658268e43980c071dbffc3d894f6f6c4b6732a upstream.
The XHCI controller is required to enter D3hot rather than D3cold for AMD
s2idle on this hardware generation.
Otherwise, the 'Controller Not Ready' (CNR) bit is not being cleared by
host in resume and eventually this results in xhci resume failures during
the s2idle wakeup.

usb: dwc3: ep0: fix NULL pointer exception
commit d00889080ab60051627dab1d85831cd9db750e2a upstream.
There is no validation of the index from dwc3\_wIndex\_to\_dep() and we might
be referring a non-existing ep and trigger a NULL pointer exception. In
certain configurations we might use fewer eps and the index might wrongly
indicate a larger ep index than existing.
By adding this validation from the patch we can actually report a wrong
index back to the caller.
In our usecase we are using a composite device on an older kernel, but
upstream might use this fix also. Unfortunately, I cannot describe the
hardware for others to reproduce the issue as it is a proprietary
implementation.

usb: dwc3: gadget: Bail from dwc3\_gadget\_exit() if dwc->gadget is NULL
commit 03715ea2e3dbbc56947137ce3b4ac18a726b2f87 upstream.
There exists a possible scenario in which dwc3\_gadget\_init() can fail:
during during host -> peripheral mode switch in dwc3\_set\_mode(), and
a pending gadget driver fails to bind. Then, if the DRD undergoes
another mode switch from peripheral->host the resulting
dwc3\_gadget\_exit() will attempt to reference an invalid and dangling
dwc->gadget pointer as well as call dma\_free\_coherent() on unmapped
DMA pointers.
The exact scenario can be reproduced as follows:
- Start DWC3 in peripheral mode
- Configure ConfigFS gadget with FunctionFS instance (or use g\_ffs)
- Run FunctionFS userspace application (open EPs, write descriptors, etc)
- Bind gadget driver to DWC3's UDC
- Switch DWC3 to host mode
=> dwc3\_gadget\_exit() is called. usb\_del\_gadget() will put the
ConfigFS driver instance on the gadget\_driver\_pending\_list
- Stop FunctionFS application (closes the ep files)
- Switch DWC3 to peripheral mode
=> dwc3\_gadget\_init() fails as usb\_add\_gadget() calls
check\_pending\_gadget\_drivers() and attempts to rebind the UDC
to the ConfigFS gadget but fails with -19 (-ENODEV) because the
FFS instance is not in FFS\_ACTIVE state (userspace has not
re-opened and written the descriptors yet, i.e. desc\_ready!=0).
- Switch DWC3 back to host mode
=> dwc3\_gadget\_exit() is called again, but this time dwc->gadget
is invalid.
Although it can be argued that userspace should take responsibility
for ensuring that the FunctionFS application be ready prior to
allowing the composite driver bind to the UDC, failure to do so
should not result in a panic from the kernel driver.
Fix this by setting dwc->gadget to NULL in the failure path of
dwc3\_gadget\_init() and add a check to dwc3\_gadget\_exit() to bail out
unless the gadget pointer is valid.

commit 1d0d3d818eafe1963ec1eaf302175cd14938188e upstream.
If an error occurs after a successful 'regulator\_enable()' call,
'regulator\_disable()' must be called.
Fix the error handling path of the probe accordingly.
The remove function doesn't need to be fixed, because the
'regulator\_disable()' call is already hidden in 'dwc3\_meson\_g12a\_suspend()'
which is called via 'pm\_runtime\_set\_suspended()' in the remove function.

usb: f\_ncm: only first packet of aggregate needs to start timer
commit 1958ff5ad2d4908b44a72bcf564dfe67c981e7fe upstream.
The reasoning for this change is that if we already had
a packet pending, then we also already had a pending timer,
and as such there is no need to reschedule it.
This also prevents packets getting delayed 60 ms worst case
under a tiny packet every 290us transmit load, by keeping the
timeout always relative to the first queued up packet.
(300us delay \* 16KB max aggregation / 80 byte packet =~ 60 ms)
As such the first packet is now at most delayed by 300us.
Under low transmit load, this will simply result in us sending
a shorter aggregate, as originally intended.
This patch has the benefit of greatly reducing (by ~10 factor
with 1500 byte frames aggregated into 16 kiB) the number of
(potentially pretty costly) updates to the hrtimer.

R-Car M3-W ES3.0 is marketed as R-Car M3-W+ (R8A77961), and has its own
compatible value "renesas,r8a77961".
Hence using soc\_device\_match() with soc\_id = "r8a7796" and revision =
"ES3.\*" does not actually match running on an R-Car M3-W+ SoC.
Fix this by matching with soc\_id = "r8a77961" instead.

ftrace: Do not blindly read the ip address in ftrace\_bug()
commit 6c14133d2d3f768e0a35128faac8aa6ed4815051 upstream.
It was reported that a bug on arm64 caused a bad ip address to be used for
updating into a nop in ftrace\_init(), but the error path (rightfully)
returned -EINVAL and not -EFAULT, as the bug caused more than one error to
occur. But because -EINVAL was returned, the ftrace\_bug() tried to report
what was at the location of the ip address, and read it directly. This
caused the machine to panic, as the ip was not pointing to a valid memory
address.
Instead, read the ip address with copy\_from\_kernel\_nofault() to safely
access the memory, and if it faults, report that the address faulted,
otherwise report what was in that location.

coredump: Limit what can interrupt coredumps
commit 06af8679449d4ed282df13191fc52d5ba28ec536 upstream.
Olivier Langlois has been struggling with coredumps being incompletely written in
processes using io\_uring.
Olivier Langlois  writes:

The coredump code deliberately supports being interrupted by SIGKILL,
and depends upon prepare\_signal to filter out all other signals. Now
that signal\_pending includes wake ups for TIF\_NOTIFY\_SIGNAL this hack
in dump\_emitted by the coredump code no longer works.
Make the coredump code more robust by explicitly testing for all of
the wakeup conditions the coredump code supports. This prevents
new wakeup conditions from breaking the coredump code, as well
as fixing the current issue.
The filesystem code that the coredump code uses already limits
itself to only aborting on fatal\_signal\_pending. So it should
not develop surprising wake-up reasons either.
v2: Don't remove the now unnecessary code in prepare\_signal.

btrfs: promote debugging asserts to full-fledged checks in validate\_super
commit aefd7f7065567a4666f42c0fc8cdb379d2e036bf upstream.
Syzbot managed to trigger this assert while performing its fuzzing.
Turns out it's better to have those asserts turned into full-fledged
checks so that in case buggy btrfs images are mounted the users gets
an error and mounting is stopped. Alternatively with CONFIG\_BTRFS\_ASSERT
disabled such image would have been erroneously allowed to be mounted.

btrfs: zoned: fix zone number to sector/physical calculation
commit 5b434df8778771d181bc19fb4593bca114d1c4eb upstream.
In btrfs\_get\_dev\_zone\_info(), we have "u32 sb\_zone" and calculate "sector\_t
sector" by shifting it. But, this "sector" is calculated in 32bit, leading
it to be 0 for the 2nd superblock copy.
Since zone number is u32, shifting it to sector (sector\_t) or physical
address (u64) can easily trigger a missing cast bug like this.
This commit introduces helpers to convert zone number to sector/LBA, so we
won't fall into the same pitfall again.

btrfs: do not write supers if we have an fs error
commit 165ea85f14831f27fc6fe3b02b35e42e50b9ed94 upstream.
Error injection testing uncovered a pretty severe problem where we could
end up committing a super that pointed to the wrong tree roots,
resulting in transid mismatch errors.
The way we commit the transaction is we update the super copy with the
current generations and bytenrs of the important roots, and then copy
that into our super\_for\_commit. Then we allow transactions to continue
again, we write out the dirty pages for the transaction, and then we
write the super. If the write out fails we'll bail and skip writing the
supers.
However since we've allowed a new transaction to start, we can have a
log attempting to sync at this point, which would be blocked on
fs\_info->tree\_log\_mutex. Once the commit fails we're allowed to do the
log tree commit, which uses super\_for\_commit, which now points at fs
tree's that were not written out.
Fix this by checking BTRFS\_FS\_STATE\_ERROR once we acquire the
tree\_log\_mutex. This way if the transaction commit fails we're sure to
see this bit set and we can skip writing the super out. This patch
fixes this specific transid mismatch error I was seeing with this
particular error path.

bcache: avoid oversized read request in cache missing code path
commit 41fe8d088e96472f63164e213de44ec77be69478 upstream.
In the cache missing code path of cached device, if a proper location
from the internal B+ tree is matched for a cache miss range, function
cached\_dev\_cache\_miss() will be called in cache\_lookup\_fn() in the
following code block,
[code block 1]
526 unsigned int sectors = KEY\_INODE(k) == s->iop.inode
527 ? min\_t(uint64\_t, INT\_MAX,
528 KEY\_START(k) - bio->bi\_iter.bi\_sector)
529 : INT\_MAX;
530 int ret = s->d->cache\_miss(b, s, bio, sectors);
Here s->d->cache\_miss() is the call backfunction pointer initialized as
cached\_dev\_cache\_miss(), the last parameter 'sectors' is an important
hint to calculate the size of read request to backing device of the
missing cache data.
Current calculation in above code block may generate oversized value of
'sectors', which consequently may trigger 2 different potential kernel
panics by BUG() or BUG\_ON() as listed below,
1) BUG\_ON() inside bch\_btree\_insert\_key(),
[code block 2]
886 BUG\_ON(b->ops->is\_extents && !KEY\_SIZE(k));
2) BUG() inside biovec\_slab(),
[code block 3]
51 default:
52 BUG();
53 return NULL;
All the above panics are original from cached\_dev\_cache\_miss() by the
oversized parameter 'sectors'.
Inside cached\_dev\_cache\_miss(), parameter 'sectors' is used to calculate
the size of data read from backing device for the cache missing. This
size is stored in s->insert\_bio\_sectors by the following lines of code,
[code block 4]
909 s->insert\_bio\_sectors = min(sectors, bio\_sectors(bio) + reada);
Then the actual key inserting to the internal B+ tree is generated and
stored in s->iop.replace\_key by the following lines of code,
[code block 5]
911 s->iop.replace\_key = KEY(s->iop.inode,
912 bio->bi\_iter.bi\_sector + s->insert\_bio\_sectors,
913 s->insert\_bio\_sectors);
The oversized parameter 'sectors' may trigger panic 1) by BUG\_ON() from
the above code block.
And the bio sending to backing device for the missing data is allocated
with hint from s->insert\_bio\_sectors by the following lines of code,
[code block 6]
926 cache\_bio = bio\_alloc\_bioset(GFP\_NOWAIT,
927 DIV\_ROUND\_UP(s->insert\_bio\_sectors, PAGE\_SECTORS),
928 &dc->disk.bio\_split);
The oversized parameter 'sectors' may trigger panic 2) by BUG() from the
agove code block.
Now let me explain how the panics happen with the oversized 'sectors'.
In code block 5, replace\_key is generated by macro KEY(). From the
definition of macro KEY(),
[code block 7]
71 #define KEY(inode, offset, size) \
72 ((struct bkey) { \
73 .high = (1ULL << 63) | ((\_\_u64) (size) << 20) | (inode), \
74 .low = (offset) \
75 })
Here 'size' is 16bits width embedded in 64bits member 'high' of struct
bkey. But in code block 1, if "KEY\_START(k) - bio->bi\_iter.bi\_sector" is
very probably to be larger than (1<<16) - 1, which makes the bkey size
calculation in code block 5 is overflowed. In one bug report the value
of parameter 'sectors' is 131072 (= 1 << 17), the overflowed 'sectors'
results the overflowed s->insert\_bio\_sectors in code block 4, then makes
size field of s->iop.replace\_key to be 0 in code block 5. Then the 0-
sized s->iop.replace\_key is inserted into the internal B+ tree as cache
missing check key (a special key to detect and avoid a racing between
normal write request and cache missing read request) as,
[code block 8]
915 ret = bch\_btree\_insert\_check\_key(b, &s->op, &s->iop.replace\_key);
Then the 0-sized s->iop.replace\_key as 3rd parameter triggers the bkey
size check BUG\_ON() in code block 2, and causes the kernel panic 1).
Another kernel panic is from code block 6, is by the bvecs number
oversized value s->insert\_bio\_sectors from code block 4,
min(sectors, bio\_sectors(bio) + reada)
There are two possibility for oversized reresult,
- bio\_sectors(bio) is valid, but bio\_sectors(bio) + reada is oversized.
- sectors < bio\_sectors(bio) + reada, but sectors is oversized.
From a bug report the result of "DIV\_ROUND\_UP(s->insert\_bio\_sectors,
PAGE\_SECTORS)" from code block 6 can be 344, 282, 946, 342 and many
other values which larther than BIO\_MAX\_VECS (a.k.a 256). When calling
bio\_alloc\_bioset() with such larger-than-256 value as the 2nd parameter,
this value will eventually be sent to biovec\_slab() as parameter
'nr\_vecs' in following code path,
bio\_alloc\_bioset() ==> bvec\_alloc() ==> biovec\_slab()
Because parameter 'nr\_vecs' is larger-than-256 value, the panic by BUG()
in code block 3 is triggered inside biovec\_slab().
From the above analysis, we know that the 4th parameter 'sector' sent
into cached\_dev\_cache\_miss() may cause overflow in code block 5 and 6,
and finally cause kernel panic in code block 2 and 3. And if result of
bio\_sectors(bio) + reada exceeds valid bvecs number, it may also trigger
kernel panic in code block 3 from code block 6.
Now the almost-useless readahead size for cache missing request back to
backing device is removed, this patch can fix the oversized issue with
more simpler method.
- add a local variable size\_limit, set it by the minimum value from
the max bkey size and max bio bvecs number.
- set s->insert\_bio\_sectors by the minimum value from size\_limit,
sectors, and the sectors size of bio.
- replace sectors by s->insert\_bio\_sectors to do bio\_next\_split.
By the above method with size\_limit, s->insert\_bio\_sectors will never
result oversized replace\_key size or bio bvecs number. And split bio
'miss' from bio\_next\_split() will always match the size of 'cache\_bio',
that is the current maximum bio size we can sent to backing device for
fetching the cache missing data.
Current problmatic code can be partially found since Linux v3.13-rc1,
therefore all maintained stable kernels should try to apply this fix.

bcache: remove bcache device self-defined readahead
commit 1616a4c2ab1a80893b6890ae93da40a2b1d0c691 upstream.
For read cache missing, bcache defines a readahead size for the read I/O
request to the backing device for the missing data. This readahead size
is initialized to 0, and almost no one uses it to avoid unnecessary read
amplifying onto backing device and write amplifying onto cache device.
Considering upper layer file system code has readahead logic allready
and works fine with readahead\_cache\_policy sysfile interface, we don't
have to keep bcache self-defined readahead anymore.
This patch removes the bcache self-defined readahead for cache missing
request for backing device, and the readahead sysfs file interfaces are
removed as well.
This is the preparation for next patch to fix potential kernel panic due
to oversized request in a simpler method.

This driver's remove path calls del\_timer(). However, that function

timer handler may still be running after the driver's remove function
has finished, which would result in a use-after-free.
Fix by calling del\_timer\_sync(), which makes sure the timer handler
has finished, and unable to re-schedule itself.

kvm: avoid speculation-based attacks from out-of-range memslot accesses
commit da27a83fd6cc7780fea190e1f5c19e87019da65c upstream.
KVM's mechanism for accessing guest memory translates a guest physical
address (gpa) to a host virtual address using the right-shifted gpa
(also known as gfn) and a struct kvm\_memory\_slot. The translation is
performed in \_\_gfn\_to\_hva\_memslot using the following formula:
hva = slot->userspace\_addr + (gfn - slot->base\_gfn) \* PAGE\_SIZE
It is expected that gfn falls within the boundaries of the guest's
physical memory. However, a guest can access invalid physical addresses
in such a way that the gfn is invalid.
\_\_gfn\_to\_hva\_memslot is called from kvm\_vcpu\_gfn\_to\_hva\_prot, which first
retrieves a memslot through \_\_gfn\_to\_memslot. While \_\_gfn\_to\_memslot
does check that the gfn falls within the boundaries of the guest's
physical memory or not, a CPU can speculate the result of the check and
continue execution speculatively using an illegal gfn. The speculation
can result in calculating an out-of-bounds hva. If the resulting host
virtual address is used to load another guest physical address, this
is effectively a Spectre gadget consisting of two consecutive reads,
the second of which is data dependent on the first.
Right now it's not clear if there are any cases in which this is
exploitable. One interesting case was reported by the original author
of this patch, and involves visiting guest page tables on x86. Right
now these are not vulnerable because the hva read goes through get\_user(),
which contains an LFENCE speculation barrier. However, there are
patches in progress for x86 uaccess.h to mask kernel addresses instead of
using LFENCE; once these land, a guest could use speculation to read
from the VMM's ring 3 address space. Other architectures such as ARM
already use the address masking method, and would be susceptible to
this same kind of data-dependent access gadgets. Therefore, this patch
proactively protects from these attacks by masking out-of-bounds gfns
in \_\_gfn\_to\_hva\_memslot, which blocks speculation of invalid hvas.
Sean Christopherson noted that this patch does not cover
kvm\_read\_guest\_offset\_cached. This however is limited to a few bytes
past the end of the cache, and therefore it is unlikely to be useful in
the context of building a chain of data dependent accesses.

KVM: X86: MMU: Use the correct inherited permissions to get shadow page
commit b1bd5cba3306691c771d558e94baa73e8b0b96b7 upstream.
When computing the access permissions of a shadow page, use the effective
permissions of the walk up to that point, i.e. the logic AND of its parents'
permissions. Two guest PxE entries that point at the same table gfn need to
be shadowed with different shadow pages if their parents' permissions are
different. KVM currently uses the effective permissions of the last
non-leaf entry for all non-leaf entries. Because all non-leaf SPTEs have
full ("uwx") permissions, and the effective permissions are recorded only
in role.access and merged into the leaves, this can lead to incorrect
reuse of a shadow page and eventually to a missing guest protection page
fault.
For example, here is a shared pagetable:
pgd[] pud[] pmd[] virtual address pointers
/->pmd1(u--)->pte1(uw-)->page1 <- ptr1 (u--)
/->pud1(uw-)--->pmd2(uw-)->pte2(uw-)->page2 <- ptr2 (uw-)
pgd-| (shared pmd[] as above)
\->pud2(u--)--->pmd1(u--)->pte1(uw-)->page1 <- ptr3 (u--)
\->pmd2(uw-)->pte2(uw-)->page2 <- ptr4 (u--)
pud1 and pud2 point to the same pmd table, so:
- ptr1 and ptr3 points to the same page.
- ptr2 and ptr4 points to the same page.
(pud1 and pud2 here are pud entries, while pmd1 and pmd2 here are pmd entries)
- First, the guest reads from ptr1 first and KVM prepares a shadow
page table with role.access=u--, from ptr1's pud1 and ptr1's pmd1.
"u--" comes from the effective permissions of pgd, pud1 and
pmd1, which are stored in pt->access. "u--" is used also to get
the pagetable for pud1, instead of "uw-".
- Then the guest writes to ptr2 and KVM reuses pud1 which is present.
The hypervisor set up a shadow page for ptr2 with pt->access is "uw-"
even though the pud1 pmd (because of the incorrect argument to
kvm\_mmu\_get\_page in the previous step) has role.access="u--".
- Then the guest reads from ptr3. The hypervisor reuses pud1's
shadow pmd for pud2, because both use "u--" for their permissions.
Thus, the shadow pmd already includes entries for both pmd1 and pmd2.
- At last, the guest writes to ptr4. This causes no vmexit or pagefault,
because pud1's shadow page structures included an "uw-" page even though
its role.access was "u--".
Any kind of shared pagetable might have the similar problem when in
virtual machine without TDP enabled if the permissions are different
from different ancestors.
In order to fix the problem, we change pt->access to be an array, and
any access in it will not include permissions ANDed from child ptes.
The test code is: https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20210603050537.19605-1-jiangshanlai@gmail.com/
Remember to test it with TDP disabled.
The problem had existed long before the commit 41074d07c78b ("KVM: MMU:
Fix inherited permissions for emulated guest pte updates"), and it
is hard to find which is the culprit. So there is no fixes tag here.

KVM: x86: Unload MMU on guest TLB flush if TDP disabled to force MMU sync
commit b53e84eed08b88fd3ff59e5c2a7f1a69d4004e32 upstream.
When using shadow paging, unload the guest MMU when emulating a guest TLB
flush to ensure all roots are synchronized. From the guest's perspective,
flushing the TLB ensures any and all modifications to its PTEs will be
recognized by the CPU.
Note, unloading the MMU is overkill, but is done to mirror KVM's existing
handling of INVPCID(all) and ensure the bug is squashed. Future cleanup
can be done to more precisely synchronize roots when servicing a guest
TLB flush.
If TDP is enabled, synchronizing the MMU is unnecessary even if nested
TDP is in play, as a "legacy" TLB flush from L1 does not invalidate L1's
TDP mappings. For EPT, an explicit INVEPT is required to invalidate
guest-physical mappings; for NPT, guest mappings are always tagged with
an ASID and thus can only be invalidated via the VMCB's ASID control.
This bug has existed since the introduction of KVM\_VCPU\_FLUSH\_TLB.
It was only recently exposed after Linux guests stopped flushing the
local CPU's TLB prior to flushing remote TLBs (see commit 4ce94eabac16,
"x86/mm/tlb: Flush remote and local TLBs concurrently"), but is also
visible in Windows 10 guests.

x86, lto: Pass -stack-alignment only on LLD < 13.0.0
commit 2398ce80152aae33b9501ef54452e09e8e8d4262 upstream.
Since LLVM commit 3787ee4, the '-stack-alignment' flag has been dropped
[1], leading to the following error message when building a LTO kernel
with Clang-13 and LLD-13:
ld.lld: error: -plugin-opt=-: ld.lld: Unknown command line argument
'-stack-alignment=8'. Try 'ld.lld --help'
ld.lld: Did you mean '--stackrealign=8'?
It also appears that the '-code-model' flag is not necessary anymore
starting with LLVM-9 [2].
Drop '-code-model' and make '-stack-alignment' conditional on LLD < 13.0.0.
These flags were necessary because these flags were not encoded in the
IR properly, so the link would restart optimizations without them. Now
there are properly encoded in the IR, and these flags exposing
implementation details are no longer necessary.

drm: Lock pointer access in drm\_master\_release()
commit c336a5ee984708db4826ef9e47d184e638e29717 upstream.
This patch eliminates the following smatch warning:
drivers/gpu/drm/drm\_auth.c:320 drm\_master\_release() warn: unlocked access 'master' (line 318) expected lock '&dev->master\_mutex'
The 'file\_priv->master' field should be protected by the mutex lock to
'&dev->master\_mutex'. This is because other processes can concurrently
modify this field and free the current 'file\_priv->master'
pointer. This could result in a use-after-free error when 'master' is
dereferenced in subsequent function calls to
'drm\_legacy\_lock\_master\_cleanup()' or to 'drm\_lease\_revoke()'.
An example of a scenario that would produce this error can be seen
from a similar bug in 'drm\_getunique()' that was reported by Syzbot:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803
In the Syzbot report, another process concurrently acquired the
device's master mutex in 'drm\_setmaster\_ioctl()', then overwrote
'fpriv->master' in 'drm\_new\_set\_master()'. The old value of
'fpriv->master' was subsequently freed before the mutex was unlocked.

drm: Fix use-after-free read in drm\_getunique()
commit b436acd1cf7fac0ba987abd22955d98025c80c2b upstream.
There is a time-of-check-to-time-of-use error in drm\_getunique() due
to retrieving file\_priv->master prior to locking the device's master
mutex.
An example can be seen in the crash report of the use-after-free error
found by Syzbot:
https://syzkaller.appspot.com/bug?id=148d2f1dfac64af52ffd27b661981a540724f803
In the report, the master pointer was used after being freed. This is
because another process had acquired the device's master mutex in
drm\_setmaster\_ioctl(), then overwrote fpriv->master in
drm\_new\_set\_master(). The old value of fpriv->master was subsequently
freed before the mutex was unlocked.
To fix this, we lock the device's master mutex before retrieving the
pointer from from fpriv->master. This patch passes the Syzbot
reproducer test.

ACPI: Pass the same capabilities to the \_OSC regardless of the query flag
commit 159d8c274fd92438ca6d7068d7a5eeda157227f4 upstream.
Commit 719e1f561afb ("ACPI: Execute platform \_OSC also with query bit
clear") makes acpi\_bus\_osc\_negotiate\_platform\_control() not only query
the platforms capabilities but it also commits the result back to the
firmware to report which capabilities are supported by the OS back to
the firmware
On certain systems the BIOS loads SSDT tables dynamically based on the
capabilities the OS claims to support. However, on these systems the
\_OSC actually clears some of the bits (under certain conditions) so what
happens is that now when we call the \_OSC twice the second time we pass
the cleared values and that results errors like below to appear on the
system log:
ACPI BIOS Error (bug): Could not resolve symbol [\\_PR.PR00.\_CPC], AE\_NOT\_FOUND (20210105/psargs-330)
ACPI Error: Aborting method \\_PR.PR01.\_CPC due to previous error (AE\_NOT\_FOUND) (20210105/psparse-529)
In addition the ACPI 6.4 spec says following [1]:
If the OS declares support of a feature in the Support Field in one
call to \_OSC, then it must preserve the set state of that bit
(declaring support for that feature) in all subsequent calls.
Based on the above we can fix the issue by passing the same set of
capabilities to the platform wide \_OSC in both calls regardless of the
query flag.
While there drop the context.ret.length checks which were wrong to begin
with (as the length is number of bytes not elements). This is already
checked in acpi\_run\_osc() that also returns an error in that case.
Includes fixes by Hans de Goede.

Revert "ACPI: sleep: Put the FACS table after using it"
commit f1ffa9d4cccc8fdf6c03fb1b3429154d22037988 upstream.
Commit 95722237cb2a ("ACPI: sleep: Put the FACS table after using it")
puts the FACS table during initialization.
But the hardware signature bits in the FACS table need to be accessed,
after every hibernation, to compare with the original hardware
signature.
So there is no reason to release the FACS table mapping after
initialization.
This reverts commit 95722237cb2ae4f7b73471058cdb19e8f4057c93.
An alternative solution is to use acpi\_gbl\_FACS variable instead, which
is mapped by the ACPICA core and never released.

spi: bcm2835: Fix out-of-bounds access with more than 4 slaves
commit 13817d466eb8713a1ffd254f537402f091d48444 upstream.
Commit 571e31fa60b3 ("spi: bcm2835: Cache CS register value for
->prepare\_message()") limited the number of slaves to 3 at compile-time.
The limitation was necessitated by a statically-sized array prepare\_cs[]
in the driver private data which contains a per-slave register value.
The commit sought to enforce the limitation at run-time by setting the
controller's num\_chipselect to 3: Slaves with a higher chipselect are
rejected by spi\_add\_device().
However the commit neglected that num\_chipselect only limits the number
of \*native\* chipselects. If GPIO chipselects are specified in the
device tree for more than 3 slaves, num\_chipselect is silently raised by
of\_spi\_get\_gpio\_numbers() and the result are out-of-bounds accesses to
the statically-sized array prepare\_cs[].
As a bandaid fix which is backportable to stable, raise the number of
allowed slaves to 24 (which "ought to be enough for anybody"), enforce
the limitation on slave ->setup and revert num\_chipselect to 3 (which is
the number of native chipselects supported by the controller).
An upcoming for-next commit will allow an arbitrary number of slaves.

The HP Elite Dragonfly G2 using ALC285 codec which using 0x04 to control
mute LED and 0x01 to control micmute LED.
In the other hand, there is no output from right channel of speaker.
Therefore, add a quirk to make it works.

ALSA: hda/realtek: headphone and mic don't work on an Acer laptop
commit 57c9e21a49b1c196cda28f54de9a5d556ac93f20 upstream.
There are 2 issues on this machine, the 1st one is mic's plug/unplug
can't be detected, that is because the mic is set to manual detecting
mode, need to apply ALC255\_FIXUP\_XIAOMI\_HEADSET\_MIC to set it to auto
detecting mode. The other one is headphone's plug/unplug can't be
detected by pulseaudio, that is because the pulseaudio will use
ucm2/sof-hda-dsp on this machine, and the ucm2 only handle
'Headphone Jack', but on this machine the headphone's pincfg sets the
location to Front, then the alsa mixer name is "Front Headphone Jack"
instead of "Headphone Jack", so override the pincfg to change location
to Left.

ALSA: firewire-lib: fix the context to call snd\_pcm\_stop\_xrun()
commit 9981b20a5e3694f4625ab5a1ddc98ce7503f6d12 upstream.
In the workqueue to queue wake-up event, isochronous context is not
processed, thus it's useless to check context for the workqueue to switch
status of runtime for PCM substream to XRUN. On the other hand, in
software IRQ context of 1394 OHCI, it's needed.
This commit fixes the bug introduced when tasklet was replaced with
workqueue.

ALSA: seq: Fix race of snd\_seq\_timer\_open()
commit 83e197a8414c0ba545e7e3916ce05f836f349273 upstream.
The timer instance per queue is exclusive, and snd\_seq\_timer\_open()
should have managed the concurrent accesses. It looks as if it's
checking the already existing timer instance at the beginning, but
it's not right, because there is no protection, hence any later
concurrent call of snd\_seq\_timer\_open() may override the timer
instance easily. This may result in UAF, as the leftover timer
instance can keep running while the queue itself gets closed, as
spotted by syzkaller recently.
For avoiding the race, add a proper check at the assignment of
tmr->timeri again, and return -EBUSY if it's been already registered.

spi: Cleanup on failure of initial setup
[ Upstream commit 2ec6f20b33eb4f62ab90bdcd620436c883ec3af6 ]
Commit c7299fea6769 ("spi: Fix spi device unregister flow") changed the
SPI core's behavior if the ->setup() hook returns an error upon adding
an spi\_device: Before, the ->cleanup() hook was invoked to free any
allocations that were made by ->setup(). With the commit, that's no
longer the case, so the ->setup() hook is expected to free the
allocations itself.
I've identified 5 drivers which depend on the old behavior and am fixing
them up hereinafter: spi-bitbang.c spi-fsl-spi.c spi-omap-uwire.c
spi-omap2-mcspi.c spi-pxa2xx.c
Importantly, ->setup() is not only invoked on spi\_device \*addition\*:
It may subsequently be called to \*change\* SPI parameters. If changing
these SPI parameters fails, freeing memory allocations would be wrong.
That should only be done if the spi\_device is finally destroyed.
I am therefore using a bool "initial\_setup" in 4 of the affected drivers
to differentiate between the invocation on \*adding\* the spi\_device and
any subsequent invocations: spi-bitbang.c spi-fsl-spi.c spi-omap-uwire.c
spi-omap2-mcspi.c
In spi-pxa2xx.c, it seems the ->setup() hook can only fail on spi\_device
addition, not any subsequent calls. It therefore doesn't need the bool.
It's worth noting that 5 other drivers already perform a cleanup if the
->setup() hook fails. Before c7299fea6769, they caused a double-free
if ->setup() failed on spi\_device addition. Since the commit, they're
fine. These drivers are: spi-mpc512x-psc.c spi-pl022.c spi-s3c64xx.c
spi-st-ssc4.c spi-tegra114.c
(spi-pxa2xx.c also already performs a cleanup, but only in one of
several error paths.)

dm verity: fix require\_signatures module\_param permissions
[ Upstream commit 0c1f3193b1cdd21e7182f97dc9bca7d284d18a15 ]
The third parameter of module\_param() is permissions for the sysfs node
but it looks like it is being used as the initial value of the parameter
here. In fact, false here equates to omitting the file from sysfs and
does not affect the value of require\_signatures.
Making the parameter writable is not simple because going from
false->true is fine but it should not be possible to remove the
requirement to verify a signature. But it can be useful to inspect the
value of this parameter from userspace, so change the permissions to
make a read-only file in sysfs.

MIPS: Fix kernel hang under FUNCTION\_GRAPH\_TRACER and PREEMPT\_TRACER
[ Upstream commit 78cf0eb926cb1abeff2106bae67752e032fe5f3e ]
When update the latest mainline kernel with the following three configs,
the kernel hangs during startup:
(1) CONFIG\_FUNCTION\_GRAPH\_TRACER=y
(2) CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_TRACER=y
(3) CONFIG\_FTRACE\_STARTUP\_TEST=y
When update the latest mainline kernel with the above two configs (1)
and (2), the kernel starts normally, but it still hangs when execute
the following command:
echo "function\_graph" > /sys/kernel/debug/tracing/current\_tracer
Without CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_TRACER=y, the above two kinds of kernel hangs
disappeared, so it seems that CONFIG\_PREEMPT\_TRACER has some influences
with function\_graph tracer at the first glance.
I use ejtag to find out the epc address is related with preempt\_enable()
in the file arch/mips/lib/mips-atomic.c, because function tracing can
trace the preempt\_{enable,disable} calls that are traced, replace them
with preempt\_{enable,disable}\_notrace to prevent function tracing from
going into an infinite loop, and then it can fix the kernel hang issue.
By the way, it seems that this commit is a complement and improvement of
commit f93a1a00f2bd ("MIPS: Fix crash that occurs when function tracing
is enabled").

Makefile: LTO: have linker check -Wframe-larger-than
[ Upstream commit 24845dcb170e16b3100bd49743687648c71387ae ]
-Wframe-larger-than= requires stack frame information, which the
frontend cannot provide. This diagnostic is emitted late during
compilation once stack frame size is available.
When building with LTO, the frontend simply lowers C to LLVM IR and does
not have stack frame information, so it cannot emit this diagnostic.
When the linker drives LTO, it restarts optimizations and lowers LLVM IR
to object code. At that point, it has stack frame information but
doesn't know to check for a specific max stack frame size.
I consider this a bug in LLVM that we need to fix. There are some
details we're working out related to LTO such as which value to use when
there are multiple different values specified per TU, or how to
propagate these to compiler synthesized routines properly, if at all.
Until it's fixed, ensure we don't miss these. At that point we can wrap
this in a compiler version guard or revert this based on the minimum
support version of Clang.
The error message is not generated during link:

scsi: target: qla2xxx: Wait for stop\_phase1 at WWN removal
[ Upstream commit 2ef7665dfd88830f15415ba007c7c9a46be7acd8 ]
Target de-configuration panics at high CPU load because TPGT and WWPN can
be removed on separate threads.
TPGT removal requests a reset HBA on a separate thread and waits for reset
complete (phase1). Due to high CPU load that HBA reset can be delayed for
some time.
WWPN removal does qlt\_stop\_phase2(). There it is believed that phase1 has
already completed and thus tgt.tgt\_ops is subsequently cleared. However,
tgt.tgt\_ops is needed to process incoming traffic and therefore this will
cause one of the following panics:

net:sfc: fix non-freed irq in legacy irq mode
[ Upstream commit 8f03eeb6e0a0a0b8d617ee0a4bce729e47130036 ]
SFC driver can be configured via modparam to work using MSI-X, MSI or
legacy IRQ interrupts. In the last one, the interrupt was not properly
released on module remove.
It was not freed because the flag irqs\_hooked was not set during
initialization in the case of using legacy IRQ.
Example of (trimmed) trace during module remove without this fix:

RDS tcp loopback connection can hang
[ Upstream commit aced3ce57cd37b5ca332bcacd370d01f5a8c5371 ]
When TCP is used as transport and a program on the
system connects to RDS port 16385, connection is
accepted but denied per the rules of RDS. However,
RDS connections object is left in the list. Next
loopback connection will select that connection
object as it is at the head of list. The connection
attempt will hang as the connection object is set
to connect over TCP which is not allowed
The issue can be reproduced easily, use rds-ping
to ping a local IP address. After that use any
program like ncat to connect to the same IP
address and port 16385. This will hang so ctrl-c out.
Now try rds-ping, it will hang.
To fix the issue this patch adds checks to disallow
the connection object creation and destroys the
connection object.

When calling the 'ql\_sem\_spinlock', the driver has already acquired the

This bug can be fixed by using 'mdelay' instead of 'ssleep'.

wq: handle VM suspension in stall detection
[ Upstream commit 940d71c6462e8151c78f28e4919aa8882ff2054e ]
If VCPU is suspended (VM suspend) in wq\_watchdog\_timer\_fn() then
once this VCPU resumes it will see the new jiffies value, while it
may take a while before IRQ detects PVCLOCK\_GUEST\_STOPPED on this
VCPU and updates all the watchdogs via pvclock\_touch\_watchdogs().
There is a small chance of misreported WQ stalls in the meantime,
because new jiffies is time\_after() old 'ts + thresh'.
wq\_watchdog\_timer\_fn()
{
for\_each\_pool(pool, pi) {
if (time\_after(jiffies, ts + thresh)) {
pr\_emerg("BUG: workqueue lockup - pool");
}
}
}
Save jiffies at the beginning of this function and use that value
for stall detection. If VM gets suspended then we continue using
"old" jiffies value and old WQ touch timestamps. If IRQ at some
point restarts the stall detection cycle (pvclock\_touch\_watchdogs())
then old jiffies will always be before new 'ts + thresh'.

cgroup: disable controllers at parse time
[ Upstream commit 45e1ba40837ac2f6f4d4716bddb8d44bd7e4a251 ]
This patch effectively reverts the commit a3e72739b7a7 ("cgroup: fix
too early usage of static\_branch\_disable()"). The commit 6041186a3258
("init: initialize jump labels before command line option parsing") has
moved the jump\_label\_init() before parse\_args() which has made the
commit a3e72739b7a7 unnecessary. On the other hand there are
consequences of disabling the controllers later as there are subsystems
doing the controller checks for different decisions. One such incident
is reported [1] regarding the memory controller and its impact on memory
reclaim code.

netlink: disable IRQs for netlink\_lock\_table()
[ Upstream commit 1d482e666b8e74c7555dbdfbfb77205eeed3ff2d ]
Syzbot reports that in mac80211 we have a potential deadlock
between our "local->stop\_queue\_reasons\_lock" (spinlock) and
netlink's nl\_table\_lock (rwlock). This is because there's at
least one situation in which we might try to send a netlink
message with this spinlock held while it is also possible to
take the spinlock from a hardirq context, resulting in the
following deadlock scenario reported by lockdep:
CPU0 CPU1
---- ----
lock(nl\_table\_lock);
local\_irq\_disable();
lock(&local->queue\_stop\_reason\_lock);
lock(nl\_table\_lock);
lock(&local->queue\_stop\_reason\_lock);
This seems valid, we can take the queue\_stop\_reason\_lock in
any kind of context ("CPU0"), and call ieee80211\_report\_ack\_skb()
with the spinlock held and IRQs disabled ("CPU1") in some
code path (ieee80211\_do\_stop() via ieee80211\_free\_txskb()).
Short of disallowing netlink use in scenarios like these
(which would be rather complex in mac80211's case due to
the deep callchain), it seems the only fix for this is to
disable IRQs while nl\_table\_lock is held to avoid hitting
this scenario, this disallows the "CPU0" portion of the
reported deadlock.
Note that the writer side (netlink\_table\_grab()) already
disables IRQs for this lock.
Unfortunately though, this seems like a huge hammer, and
maybe the whole netlink table locking should be reworked.

bonding: init notify\_work earlier to avoid uninitialized use
[ Upstream commit 35d96e631860226d5dc4de0fad0a415362ec2457 ]
If bond\_kobj\_init() or later kzalloc() in bond\_alloc\_slave() fail,
then we call kobject\_put() on the slave->kobj. This in turn calls
the release function slave\_kobj\_release() which will always try to
cancel\_delayed\_work\_sync(&slave->notify\_work), which shouldn't be
done on an uninitialized work struct.
Always initialize the work struct earlier to avoid problems here.
Syzbot bisected this down to a completely pointless commit, some
fault injection may have been at work here that caused the alloc
failure in the first place, which may interact badly with bisect.

'nj\_setup' in netjet.c might fail with -EIO and in this case
'card->irq' is initialized and is bigger than zero. A subsequent call to
'nj\_release' will free the irq that has not been requested.
Fix this bug by deleting the previous assignment to 'card->irq' and just
keep the assignment before 'request\_irq'.

MODULE\_DEVICE\_TABLE is used to extract the device information out of the

kernel can find the driver if available when the device is plugged in,
and then loads that driver and initializes the device.

vfio-ccw: Serialize FSM IDLE state with I/O completion
[ Upstream commit 2af7a834a435460d546f0cf0a8b8e4d259f1d910 ]
Today, the stacked call to vfio\_ccw\_sch\_io\_todo() does three things:
1) Update a solicited IRB with CP information, and release the CP
if the interrupt was the end of a START operation.
2) Copy the IRB data into the io\_region, under the protection of
the io\_mutex
3) Reset the vfio-ccw FSM state to IDLE to acknowledge that
vfio-ccw can accept more work.
The trouble is that step 3 is (A) invoked for both solicited and
unsolicited interrupts, and (B) sitting after the mutex for step 2.
This second piece becomes a problem if it processes an interrupt
for a CLEAR SUBCHANNEL while another thread initiates a START,
thus allowing the CP and FSM states to get out of sync. That is:
CPU 1 CPU 2
fsm\_do\_clear()
fsm\_irq()
fsm\_io\_request()
vfio\_ccw\_sch\_io\_todo()
fsm\_io\_helper()
Since the FSM state and CP should be kept in sync, let's make a
note when the CP is released, and rely on that as an indication
that the FSM should also be reset at the end of this routine and
open up the device for more work.

vfio-ccw: Reset FSM state to IDLE inside FSM
[ Upstream commit 6c02ac4c9211edabe17bda437ac97e578756f31b ]
When an I/O request is made, the fsm\_io\_request() routine
moves the FSM state from IDLE to CP\_PROCESSING, and then
fsm\_io\_helper() moves it to CP\_PENDING if the START SUBCHANNEL
received a cc0. Yet, the error case to go from CP\_PROCESSING
back to IDLE is done after the FSM call returns.
Let's move this up into the FSM proper, to provide some
better symmetry when unwinding in this case.

bpf: Add deny list of btf ids check for tracing programs
[ Upstream commit 35e3815fa8102fab4dee75f3547472c66581125d ]
The recursion check in \_\_bpf\_prog\_enter and \_\_bpf\_prog\_exit
leaves some (not inlined) functions unprotected:
In \_\_bpf\_prog\_enter:
- migrate\_disable is called before prog->active is checked
In \_\_bpf\_prog\_exit:
- migrate\_enable,rcu\_read\_unlock\_strict are called after
prog->active is decreased
When attaching trampoline to them we get panic like:

net/nfc/rawsock.c: fix a permission check bug
[ Upstream commit 8ab78863e9eff11910e1ac8bcf478060c29b379e ]
The function rawsock\_create() calls a privileged function sk\_alloc(), which requires a ns-aware check to check net->user\_ns, i.e., ns\_capable(). However, the original code checks the init\_user\_ns using capable(). So we replace the capable() with ns\_capable().

bpf: Forbid trampoline attach for functions with variable arguments
[ Upstream commit 31379397dcc364a59ce764fabb131b645c43e340 ]
We can't currently allow to attach functions with variable arguments.
The problem is that we should save all the registers for arguments,
which is probably doable, but if caller uses more than 6 arguments,
we need stack data, which will be wrong, because of the extra stack
frame we do in bpf trampoline, so we could crash.
Also currently there's malformed trampoline code generated for such
functions at the moment as described in:

spi: Fix spi device unregister flow
[ Upstream commit c7299fea67696db5bd09d924d1f1080d894f92ef ]
When an SPI device is unregistered, the spi->controller->cleanup() is
called in the device's release callback. That's wrong for a couple of
reasons:
1. spi\_dev\_put() can be called before spi\_add\_device() is called. And
it's spi\_add\_device() that calls spi\_setup(). This will cause clean()
to get called without the spi device ever being setup.
2. There's no guarantee that the controller's driver would be present by
the time the spi device's release function gets called.
3. It also causes "sleeping in atomic context" stack dump[1] when device
link deletion code does a put\_device() on the spi device.
Fix these issues by simply moving the cleanup from the device release
callback to the actual spi\_unregister\_device() function.

proc: Track /proc/$pid/attr/ opener mm\_struct
commit 591a22c14d3f45cc38bd1931c593c221df2f1881 upstream.
Commit bfb819ea20ce ("proc: Check /proc/$pid/attr/ writes against file opener")
tried to make sure that there could not be a confusion between the opener of
a /proc/$pid/attr/ file and the writer. It used struct cred to make sure
the privileges didn't change. However, there were existing cases where a more
privileged thread was passing the opened fd to a differently privileged thread
(during container setup). Instead, use mm\_struct to track whether the opener
and writer are still the same process. (This is what several other proc files
already do, though for different reasons.)

KVM: X86: MMU: Use the correct inherited permissions to get shadow page

[Browse files](/torvalds/linux/tree/b1bd5cba3306691c771d558e94baa73e8b0b96b7)

```
When computing the access permissions of a shadow page, use the effective
permissions of the walk up to that point, i.e. the logic AND of its parents'
permissions.  Two guest PxE entries that point at the same table gfn need to
be shadowed with different shadow pages if their parents' permissions are
different.  KVM currently uses the effective permissions of the last
non-leaf entry for all non-leaf entries.  Because all non-leaf SPTEs have
full ("uwx") permissions, and the effective permissions are recorded only
in role.access and merged into the leaves, this can lead to incorrect
reuse of a shadow page and eventually to a missing guest protection page
fault.

For example, here is a shared pagetable:

   pgd[]   pud[]        pmd[]            virtual address pointers
                     /->pmd1(u--)->pte1(uw-)->page1 <- ptr1 (u--)
        /->pud1(uw-)--->pmd2(uw-)->pte2(uw-)->page2 <- ptr2 (uw-)
   pgd-|           (shared pmd[] as above)
        \->pud2(u--)--->pmd1(u--)->pte1(uw-)->page1 <- ptr3 (u--)
                     \->pmd2(uw-)->pte2(uw-)->page2 <- ptr4 (u--)

  pud1 and pud2 point to the same pmd table, so:
  - ptr1 and ptr3 points to the same page.
  - ptr2 and ptr4 points to the same page.

(pud1 and pud2 here are pud entries, while pmd1 and pmd2 here are pmd entries)

- First, the guest reads from ptr1 first and KVM prepares a shadow
  page table with role.access=u--, from ptr1's pud1 and ptr1's pmd1.
  "u--" comes from the effective permissions of pgd, pud1 and
  pmd1, which are stored in pt->access.  "u--" is used also to get
  the pagetable for pud1, instead of "uw-".

- Then the guest writes to ptr2 and KVM reuses pud1 which is present.
  The hypervisor set up a shadow page for ptr2 with pt->access is "uw-"
  even though the pud1 pmd (because of the incorrect argument to
  kvm_mmu_get_page in the previous step) has role.access="u--".

- Then the guest reads from ptr3.  The hypervisor reuses pud1's
  shadow pmd for pud2, because both use "u--" for their permissions.
  Thus, the shadow pmd already includes entries for both pmd1 and pmd2.

- At last, the guest writes to ptr4.  This causes no vmexit or pagefault,
  because pud1's shadow page structures included an "uw-" page even though
  its role.access was "u--".

Any kind of shared pagetable might have the similar problem when in
virtual machine without TDP enabled if the permissions are different
from different ancestors.

In order to fix the problem, we change pt->access to be an array, and
any access in it will not include permissions ANDed from child ptes.

The test code is: [https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20210603050537.19605-1-jiangshanlai@gmail.com/](https://lore.kernel.org/kvm/20210603050537.19605-1-jiangshanlai%40gmail.com/)
Remember to test it with TDP disabled.

The problem had existed long before the commit [41074d0](https://github.com/torvalds/linux/commit/41074d07c78b086b18fc2af590caef05dbcca568) ("KVM: MMU:
Fix inherited permissions for emulated guest pte updates"), and it
is hard to find which is the culprit.  So there is no fixes tag here.

                 CVE-2021-43389

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in the Linux kernel that
may lead to a privilege escalation, denial of service, or information
leaks.

CVE-2020-3702

    A flaw was found in the driver for Atheros IEEE 802.11n family of
    chipsets (ath9k) allowing information disclosure.

CVE-2020-16119

    Hadar Manor reported a use-after-free in the DCCP protocol
    implementation in the Linux kernel. A local attacker can take
    advantage of this flaw to cause a denial of service or potentially
    to execute arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-0920

    A race condition was discovered in the local sockets (AF_UNIX)
    subsystem, which could lead to a use-after-free.  A local user
    could exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or
    crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3612

    Murray McAllister reported a flaw in the joystick input subsystem.
    A local user permitted to access a joystick device could exploit
    this to read and write out-of-bounds in the kernel, which could
    be used for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-3653

   Maxim Levitsky discovered a vulnerability in the KVM hypervisor
   implementation for AMD processors in the Linux kernel: Missing
   validation of the `int_ctl` VMCB field could allow a malicious L1
   guest to enable AVIC support (Advanced Virtual Interrupt
   Controller) for the L2 guest. The L2 guest can take advantage of
   this flaw to write to a limited but still relatively large subset
   of the host physical memory.

CVE-2021-3655

    Ilja Van Sprundel and Marcelo Ricardo Leitner found multiple flaws
    in the SCTP implementation, where missing validation could lead to
    an out-of-bounds read.  On a system using SCTP, a networked
    attacker could exploit these to cause a denial of service (crash).

CVE-2021-3679

    A flaw in the Linux kernel tracing module functionality could
    allow a privileged local user (with CAP_SYS_ADMIN capability) to
    cause a denial of service (resource starvation).

CVE-2021-3732

    Alois Wohlschlager reported a flaw in the implementation of the
    overlayfs subsystem, allowing a local attacker with privileges to
    mount a filesystem to reveal files hidden in the original mount.

CVE-2021-3753

    Minh Yuan reported a race condition in the vt_k_ioctl in
    drivers/tty/vt/vt_ioctl.c, which may cause an out of bounds read
    in vt.

CVE-2021-3760

    Lin Horse reported a flaw in the NCI (NFC Controller Interface)
    driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.

    However, this driver is not included in the binary packages
    provided by Debian.

CVE-2021-20317

    It was discovered that the timer queue structure could become
    corrupt, leading to waiting tasks never being woken up.  A local
    user with certain privileges could exploit this to cause a denial
    of service (system hang).

CVE-2021-20321

    A race condition was discovered in the overlayfs filesystem
    driver.  A local user with access to an overlayfs mount and to its
    underlying upper directory could exploit this for privilege
    escalation.

CVE-2021-20322

    An information leak was discovered in the IPv4 implementation.  A
    remote attacker could exploit this to quickly discover which UDP
    ports a system is using, making it easier for them to carry out a
    DNS poisoning attack against that system.

CVE-2021-22543

    David Stevens discovered a flaw in how the KVM hypervisor maps
    host memory into a guest.  A local user permitted to access
    /dev/kvm could use this to cause certain pages to be freed when
    they should not, leading to a use-after-free.  This could be used
    to cause a denial of service (crash or memory corruption) or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-37159

    A flaw was discovered in the hso driver for Option mobile
    broadband modems.  An error during initialisation could lead to a
    double-free or use-after-free.  An attacker able to plug in USB
    devices could use this to cause a denial of service (crash or
    memory corruption) or possibly to run arbitrary code.

CVE-2021-38160

    A flaw in the virtio_console was discovered allowing data
    corruption or data loss by an untrusted device.

CVE-2021-38198

    A flaw was discovered in the KVM implementation for x86
    processors, that could result in virtual memory protection within
    a guest not being applied correctly.  When shadow page tables are
    used - i.e. for nested virtualisation, or on CPUs lacking the EPT
    or NPT feature - a user of the guest OS might be able to exploit
    this for denial of service or privilege escalation within the
    guest.

CVE-2021-38199

    Michael Wakabayashi reported a flaw in the NFSv4 client
    implementation, where incorrect connection setup ordering allows
    operations of a remote NFSv4 server to cause a denial of service.

CVE-2021-38204

    A flaw was discovered in the max4321-hcd USB host controller
    driver, which could lead to a use-after-free.

    However, this driver is not included in the binary packages
    provided by Debian.

CVE-2021-38205

    An information leak was discovered in the xilinx_emaclite network
    driver.  On a custom kernel where this driver is enabled and used,
    this might make it easier to exploit other kernel bugs.

CVE-2021-40490

    A race condition was discovered in the ext4 subsystem when writing
    to an inline_data file while its xattrs are changing. This could
    result in denial of service.

CVE-2021-41864

    An integer overflow was discovered in the Extended BPF (eBPF)
    subsystem.  A local user could exploit this for denial of service
    (memory corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege
    escalation.

    This can be mitigated by setting sysctl
    kernel.unprivileged_bpf_disabled=1, which disables eBPF use by
    unprivileged users.

CVE-2021-42008

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the 6pack serial port
    network driver.  A local user with CAP_NET_ADMIN capability could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash), or
    possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-42739

    A heap buffer overflow was discovered in the firedtv driver for
    FireWire-connected DVB receivers.  A local user with access to a
    firedtv device could exploit this for denial of service (memory
    corruption or crash), or possibly for privilege escalation.

CVE-2021-43389

    The Active Defense Lab of Venustech discovered a flaw in the CMTP
    subsystem as used by Bluetooth, which could lead to an
    out-of-bounds read and object type confusion.  A local user with
    CAP_NET_ADMIN capability in the initial user namespace could
    exploit this for denial of service (memory corruption or crash),
    or possibly for privilege escalation.

For Debian 9 stretch, these problems have been fixed in version
4.9.290-1.

We recommend that you upgrade your linux packages.
