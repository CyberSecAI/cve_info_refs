- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Password stored in cleartext.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Sensitive information (passwords) are stored in clear text rather than being properly encrypted or hashed.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker gaining access to the stored cleartext passwords could potentially compromise the system or gain unauthorized access.
- **Attack vectors**: The document doesn't specify how the passwords can be accessed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The document does not specify attacker capabilities, other than having access to the stored cleartext passwords.
