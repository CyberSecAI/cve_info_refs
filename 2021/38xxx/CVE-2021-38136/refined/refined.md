- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is caused by a lack of sanitization of the `snap_file` parameter in the `/it-IT/splunkd/__raw/services/get_snapshot` HTTP API endpoint. The application directly uses this parameter to construct the path to a file it will serve, without checking for path traversal sequences like `../`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Path traversal vulnerability in the `snap_file` parameter.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the target host.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is an HTTP request to the `/it-IT/splunkd/__raw/services/get_snapshot` endpoint with a crafted `snap_file` parameter containing path traversal sequences.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have a user account with "swa-monitor" privileges to access the vulnerable endpoint.
