Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-38375:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from how the Open-Xchange middleware handles HTML emails with a large amount of content. To improve performance, such emails are truncated, and their full content is loaded in a separate browser tab. The mechanism that handles inline images within these emails was vulnerable to script injection via the `alt` tag of an HTML `img` element.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) - CWE-80:** The core vulnerability is an XSS issue. Specifically, the application failed to properly sanitize the `alt` attribute of `<img>` tags in HTML emails, allowing for the injection of malicious JavaScript code.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The application lacked proper sanitization for user-controlled input within the email processing, specifically the `alt` attribute of the `img` tag.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Malicious Script Execution:** An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser context.
*   **Session Hijacking:** The attacker could potentially hijack the user's session by stealing cookies or other session tokens.
*   **Unwanted Actions:** The attacker could trigger unauthorized actions on the user's behalf within the web interface, such as redirecting the user to a malicious website.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Email Injection:** The primary attack vector is through crafted HTML emails.
*   **Specific HTML Elements:** The vulnerability is triggered through malicious content within the `alt` attribute of `<img>` tags.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Send Emails:** The attacker must be able to send emails to the victim.
*   **Crafted Email Content:** The attacker needs to create a specifically crafted HTML email with malicious JavaScript embedded within the `alt` tag of an image.
*   **User Interaction:** The victim needs to open the full non-truncated version of the email in a dedicated browser tab for the vulnerability to be exploited.

**Additional Details:**

*   The advisory provides a proof-of-concept payload: `<img alt="src=foo.bar/onerror=alert('XSS')//" src="">`
*   The vulnerability was fixed by updating the sanitization logic to handle embedded script code fragments.
*   The vulnerability affects Open-Xchange App Suite version 7.10.5 and earlier.
*   The fix was included in versions 7.10.3-rev36, 7.10.4-rev27 and 7.10.5-rev21.
