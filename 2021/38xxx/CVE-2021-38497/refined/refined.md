{
  "CVE-2021-38497": {
    "Description": "Through use of `reportValidity()` and `window.open()`, a plain-text validation message could have been overlaid on another origin, leading to possible user confusion and spoofing attacks.",
    "Root cause": "The form validation popup was not correctly hidden when switching tabs or navigating to a new page, which was caused by anchoring the popup to a rectangle passed from the child process instead of a specific DOM node's frame.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Incorrect handling of form validation popups across different origins",
       "Lack of proper hiding mechanism for the validation popup when the associated context is destroyed (e.g., tab switch, navigation)."
    ],
    "Impact": "A plain-text validation message could have been overlaid on another origin, leading to possible user confusion and spoofing attacks. Users may trust the overlaid message on a different origin and follow its instructions, potentially leading to phishing or other malicious actions.",
     "Attack vectors": [
      "An attacker could craft a malicious webpage that uses reportValidity() to display a validation message.",
        "Open a new window using window.open() to a target website where the malicious validation message will appear."
    ],
    "Required attacker capabilities": [
       "Ability to host a webpage.",
      "Ability to use JavaScript and HTML form elements."
    ],
        "Affected software": [
      "Firefox 91",
      "Firefox 92",
      "Firefox 93",
      "Firefox ESR 91"
    ],
        "Patched versions": [
            "Firefox 93",
            "Firefox 94",
            "Firefox ESR 91.2"
        ]
