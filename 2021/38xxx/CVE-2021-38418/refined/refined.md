Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the use of HTTP protocol by default in Delta Electronics DIALink software for communication, which leads to cleartext transmission of sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
Cleartext transmission of sensitive information (CWE-319). The application uses unencrypted HTTP protocol for communication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
An attacker positioned between the communicating parties can perform a machine-in-the-middle (MitM) attack. This would allow the attacker to intercept and access sensitive information without authorization, potentially leading to unauthorized access and further compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. An attacker needs to be positioned on the network path between the client and the server running the DIALink software to intercept the traffic.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be able to intercept network traffic. This could mean being on the same local network or having a position in the network that allows them to observe traffic between the DIALink client and server. No authentication is needed to exploit this vulnerability, the attacker only needs to observe the traffic. The attack has low complexity.
