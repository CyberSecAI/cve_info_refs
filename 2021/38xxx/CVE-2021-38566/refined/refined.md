    "Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Untrusted URL Invocation vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents, which attackers could exploit to access the resources or execute malicious actions under users’ systems by embedding malicious images or codes in PDF documents. This occurs as the application loads images from all resources (including those untrusted) when parsing the image resources or fails to properly request user confirmation before getting or posting content from external HTTP servers.",
    "Addressed potential issues where the application could deliver incorrect signature verification information when handling certain signed XFA documents, which attackers could exploit to manipulate document content and deceive users into trusting and signing the manipulated documents. This occurs as the application improperly ignores the changes to the “/NeedsRendering” key or “TextField” field when verifying the XFA documents.",
    "Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to an Information Disclosure vulnerability when handling certain XFA documents with the “app.openDoc” function, certain PDF files with the ‘’LaunchAction” function, or submitting form data in certain XFA documents with encryption elements. Attackers could exploit this vulnerability to exfiltrate XFA data from other documents on the file system or from SMB servers, retrieve NTLM information, or access form data. This occurs as the application fails to provide a reasonable prompt for user confirmation when executing the “app.openDoc”/“LaunchAction” functions, or ignores the encryption elements and transmits form content in clear text without a proper prompt for users.",
    "Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Use-After-Free vulnerability and crash when handling certain AcroForms, checkbox objects, or 3D page objects, which attackers could exploit to execute remote code.

     "Addressed potential issues where the application could be exposed to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability when performing an update or installing a plugin, which attackers could exploit to delete arbitrary files or execute arbitrary code so as to carry out privilege escalation attacks. This occurs due to the incorrect permission assignment on the resources used by the update service, improper signature validation and incomplete certificate check for the updater, weak randomness setting for the name of the temporary folder during a plugin installation, or improper DLL loading without using the built-in manifest file.

   "Addressed a potential issue where the application could be exposed to a Privilege Escalation vulnerability during the deactivation or uninstallation if the application is reinstalled without prior uninstallation, which attackers could exploit to execute malicious actions. This occurs due to the inadequate permission setting for the “/usr/local/share/foxit” folder used during the installation so that low-privilege attackers can easily tamper with the script files in the directory."
