The provided content is related to CVE-2021-38098.

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability is caused by a malformed PDF file, which results in an out-of-bounds heap memory access due to an improper bounds check within Corel PDF Fusion.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Heap Memory Corruption
- Out-of-bounds heap memory access
- Improper bounds check when decoding PDF files in Corel PDF Fusion.

**Impact:**
Attackers can exploit this vulnerability using the out-of-bounds access for unintended reads, writes, or frees, which can lead to:
- Code corruption
- Control-flow hijack
- Information leak

**Attack Vectors:**
- A remote attacker can exploit the vulnerability by crafting a malicious PDF file.
- The crafted PDF file, when opened by a vulnerable application, triggers the out-of-bounds access, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to create and distribute a crafted PDF file.
- The target user must open the malicious PDF file using the vulnerable Corel PDF Fusion application.
