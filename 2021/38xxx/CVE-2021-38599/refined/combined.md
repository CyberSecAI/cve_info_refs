### @sehrope **[sehrope](/sehrope)** commented [Aug 11, 2021](#issue-967165742)

This PR fixes a security issue with wal-g that the binary releases published as GitHub Releases are built without libsodium support and silently ignore user requests to use libsodium encryption. The three commits in this PR:

* Enable libsodium in the GitHub release builds.
* Exit with failure if the user requests to use libsodium encryption but the application was not compiled with libsodium support.
* Enables manual triggering of unit tests GitHub Action (not really related but was helpful for testing)

The security issue is that a user would expect that their backup files are encrypted but they're silently processed and uploaded as plaintext. The exit-with-failure piece checks if either WALG\_LIBSODIUM\_KEY or WALG\_LIBSODIUM\_KEY\_PATH are specified and if the binary was not compiled with libsodium support, then it prints an error and immediately exits.

This will be a breaking change for anybody using the GitHub Release binaries who specify libsodium keys on their primary (performing the uploads) but do not include them in their replicas. Previously everything was handled as plaintext so the replicas would have been able to read the primary's plaintext backups. After including this fix, the primary will be uploading encrypted files but any replicas that are missing the libsodium keys will no longer be able to read them unless they also have the same environment variables specified for the libsodium keys (so users need to make sure all their servers are in sync for libsodium usage).

Longer term I think it'd be simpler if there was a single way to specify how to handle encryption. Right now it's a series of if-then-else logic that checks against a bunch of different environment variables, e.g. there's WALG\_GPG\_KEY\_ID, WALG\_PGP\_KEY, WALG\_LIBSODIUM\_KEY... If more than one is defined than the one that is picked is based upon the if-then-else order.

A single environment variable, e.g. WALG\_ENCRYPTION, could instead be used for both the encryption mechanism and where to look for key material. That way it's explicit and a user indicating a given mechanism knows for sure that's what shall be used, or the app could fail if it's not possible (e.g. no compiled support for the requested mechanism).

That'd be a separate, possibly breaking change, so just leaving it here for future discussion.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also¬† adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot¬† throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization‚Äôs codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer‚Äôs knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses ‚Äì rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. ‚Äì you should continue these policies with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot‚Äôs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You‚Äôre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot‚Äôs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.

GeneralPlans & PricingPrivacyResponsible AI
### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That‚Äôs why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don‚Äôt and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world‚Äôs most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot‚Äôs best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ‚Äúcopy/paste‚Äù?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot‚Äôs suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not ‚Äúcopying and pasting‚Äù from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor‚Äîfocusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot‚Äôs model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub‚Äôs model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub‚Äôs Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub‚Äôs retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features‚Äô effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU‚Äôs General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot‚Äôs suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here‚Äôs some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:¬† Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot‚Äôs AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub‚Äôs public repositories‚Äîwhich are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub‚Äôs research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub‚Äôs AI model. Again, Copilot does not ‚Äúlook up‚Äù or ‚Äúcopy and paste‚Äù code, but is instead using context from a user‚Äôs workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot‚Äôs model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there‚Äôs a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories‚Äîincluding ones without licenses‚Äîthat code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don‚Äôt determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‚Äòfunctional‚Äô instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we‚Äôve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It‚Äôs not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called ‚ÄúCopilot‚Äù not ‚ÄúAutopilot‚Äù and it‚Äôs not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot‚Äôs suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section.

Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot‚Äôs suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You‚Äôre entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot‚Äôs filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

Fix libsodium missing from GitHub Releases ([#1062](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/pull/1062))

```
* Fix release GitHub action to enable libsodium

* Exit with failure if keys are detected but not compiled with libsodium support

Adds a check for the existence of libsodium keys in non-libsodium builds. If keys are detected then
exit with failure as the user likely wanted to encrypt all file activity but it is not possible as
the application was not compiled with support for libsodium.

Previously, wal-g would continue to operate as if no encryption was requested.

* Add option to manually trigger GitHub Action CI
```

## Package

gomod

github.com/wal-g/wal-g
([Go](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Ago))

## Affected versions

< 1.1

## Patched versions

1.1

## Description

WAL-G before 1.1, when a non-libsodium build (e.g., one of the official binary releases published as GitHub Releases) is used, silently ignores the libsodium encryption key and uploads cleartext backups. This is arguably a Principle of Least Surprise violation because "the user likely wanted to encrypt all file activity."

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

WAL-G is an archival restoration tool for PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, and MS SQL Server (beta for MongoDB and Redis).

WAL-G is the successor of WAL-E with a number of key differences. WAL-G uses LZ4, LZMA, ZSTD, or Brotli compression, multiple processors, and non-exclusive base backups for Postgres. More information on the original design and implementation of WAL-G can be found on the Citus Data blog post ["Introducing WAL-G by Citus: Faster Disaster Recovery for Postgres"](https://www.citusdata.com/blog/2017/08/18/introducing-wal-g-faster-restores-for-postgres/).

## Installation

A precompiled binary for Linux AMD 64 of the latest version of WAL-G can be obtained under the [Releases tab](https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g/releases).

Binary name has the following format: `wal-g-DBNAME-OSNAME`, where `DBNAME` stands for the name of the database (for example pg, mysql), `OSNAME` stands for the name of the operating system used for building the binary.

To decompress the binary, use:

```
tar -zxvf wal-g-DBNAME-OSNAME-amd64.tar.gz
mv wal-g-DBNAME-OSNAME-amd64 /usr/local/bin/wal-g

```

For example, for Postgres and Ubuntu 18.04:

```
tar -zxvf wal-g-pg-ubuntu-18.04-amd64.tar.gz
mv wal-g-pg-ubuntu-18.04-amd64 /usr/local/bin/wal-g

```

For other systems, please consult the [Development](#development) section for more information.

WAL-G supports bash and zsh autocompletion. Run `wal-g help completion` for more info.

## Configuration

There are two ways how you can configure WAL-G:

1. Using environment variables
2. Using a config file

   `--config /path` flag can be used to specify the path where the config file is located.

   We support every format that the [viper package](https://github.com/spf13/viper) supports: JSON, YAML, envfile and [others](https://github.com/spf13/viper#reading-config-files).

Every configuration variable mentioned in the following documentation can be specified either as an environment variable or a field in the config file.

### Storage

To configure where WAL-G stores backups, please consult the [Storages](/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/STORAGES.md) section.

### Compression

* `WALG_COMPRESSION_METHOD`

To configure the compression method used for backups. Possible options are: `lz4`, `lzma`, `zstd`, `brotli`. The default method is `lz4`. LZ4 is the fastest method, but the compression ratio is bad.
LZMA is way much slower. However, it compresses backups about 6 times better than LZ4. Brotli and zstd are a good trade-off between speed and compression ratio, which is about 3 times better than LZ4.

### Encryption

* `YC_CSE_KMS_KEY_ID`

To configure Yandex Cloud KMS key for client-side encryption and decryption. By default, no encryption is used.

* `YC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE`

To configure the name of a file containing private key of Yandex Cloud Service Account. If not set a token from the metadata service (<http://169.254.169.254>) will be used to make API calls to Yandex Cloud KMS.

* `WALG_LIBSODIUM_KEY`

To configure encryption and decryption with libsodium. WAL-G uses an [algorithm](https://download.libsodium.org/doc/secret-key_cryptography/secretstream#algorithm) that only requires a secret key. libsodium keys are fixed-size keys of 32 bytes. For optimal cryptographic security, it is recommened to use a random 32 byte key. To generate a random key, you can something like `openssl rand -hex 32` (set `WALG_LIBSODIUM_KEY_TRANSFORM` to `hex`) or `openssl rand -base64 32` (set `WALG_LIBSODIUM_KEY_TRANSFORM` to `base64`).

* `WALG_LIBSODIUM_KEY_PATH`

Similar to `WALG_LIBSODIUM_KEY`, but value is the path to the key on file system. The file content will be trimmed from whitespace characters.

* `WALG_LIBSODIUM_KEY_TRANSFORM`

The transform that will be applied to the `WALG_LIBSODIUM_KEY` to get the required 32 byte key. Supported transformations are `base64`, `hex` or `none` (default).
The option `none` exists for backwards compatbility, the user input will be converted to 32 byte either via truncation or by zero-padding.

* `WALG_GPG_KEY_ID` (alternative form `WALE_GPG_KEY_ID`) ‚ö†Ô∏è **DEPRECATED**

To configure GPG key for encryption and decryption. By default, no encryption is used. Public keyring is cached in the file "/.walg\_key\_cache".

* `WALG_PGP_KEY`

To configure encryption and decryption with OpenPGP standard. You can join multiline key using `\n` symbols into one line (mostly used in case of daemontools and envdir).
Set *private key* value when you need to execute `wal-fetch` or `backup-fetch` command.
Set *public key* value when you need to execute `wal-push` or `backup-push` command.
Keep in mind that the *private key* also contains the *public key*.

* `WALG_PGP_KEY_PATH`

Similar to `WALG_PGP_KEY`, but value is the path to the key on file system.

* `WALG_PGP_KEY_PASSPHRASE`

If your *private key* is encrypted with a *passphrase*, you should set *passphrase* for decrypt.

* `WALG_ENVELOPE_PGP_KEY`
  To configure encryption and decryption with the envelope PGP key stored in key management system.
  This option allows you to securely manage your PGP keys by storing them in the KMS.
  It is crucial to ensure that the key passed is encrypted using kms and encoded with *base64*.
  Also both *private* and *publlic* parts should be presents in key because envelope key will be injected in metadata and used later in `wal/backup-fetch`.

Please note that currently, only Yandex Cloud Key Management Service (KMS) is supported for configuring.
Ensure that you have set up and configured Yandex Cloud KMS mentioned below before attempting to use this feature.

* `WALG_ENVELOPE_CACHE_EXPIRATION`

This setting controls kms response expiration. Default value is `0` to store keys permanent in memory.
Please note that if the system will not be able to redecrypt the key in kms after expiration, the previous response will be used.

* `WALG_ENVELOPE_PGP_YC_ENDPOINT`

Endpoint is an API endpoint of Yandex.Cloud against which the SDK is used. Most users won't need to explicitly set it.

* `WALG_ENVELOPE_PGP_YC_CSE_KMS_KEY_ID`

Similar to `YC_CSE_KMS_KEY_ID`, but only used for envelope pgp keys.

* `WALG_ENVELOPE_PGP_YC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE`

Similar to `YC_SERVICE_ACCOUNT_KEY_FILE`, but only used for envelope pgp keys.

* `WALG_ENVELOPE_PGP_KEY_PATH`

Similar to `WALG_ENVELOPE_PGP_KEY`, but value is the path to the key on file system.

### Monitoring

* `WALG_STATSD_ADDRESS`

To enable metrics publishing to [statsd](https://github.com/statsd/statsd) or [statsd\_exporter](https://github.com/prometheus/statsd_exporter). Metrics will be sent on a best-effort basis via UDP. The default port for statsd is `8125`.

* `WALG_STATSD_EXTRA_TAGS`

Use this setting to add static tags (`host`, `operation`, `database`, etc) to the metrics WAL-G publishes to statsd.

If you want to make demo for testing purposes, you can use graphite service from docker-compose file.

### Profiling

Profiling is useful for identifying bottlenecks within WAL-G.

* `PROFILE_SAMPLING_RATIO`

A float value between 0 and 1, defines likelihood of the profiler getting enabled. When set to 1, it will always run. This allows probabilistic sampling of invocations. Since WAL-G processes may get created several times per second (e.g. wal-g wal-push), we do not want to profile all of them.

* `PROFILE_MODE`

The type of pprof profiler to use. Can be one of `cpu`, `mem`, `mutex`, `block`, `threadcreation`, `trace`, `goroutine`. See the [runtime/pprof docs](https://pkg.go.dev/runtime/pprof) for more information. Defaults to `cpu`.

* `PROFILE_PATH`

The directory to store profiles in. Defaults to `$TMPDIR`.

### Rate limiting

* `WALG_NETWORK_RATE_LIMIT`

Network traffic rate limit during the `backup-push`/`backup-fetch` operations in bytes per second.

### Database-specific options

**More options are available for the chosen database. See it in [Databases](#databases)**

## Usage

WAL-G currently supports these commands for all type of databases:

### `backup-list`

Lists names and creation time of available backups.

`--pretty` flag prints list in a table

`--json` flag prints list in JSON format, pretty-printed if combined with `--pretty`

`--detail` flag prints extra backup details, pretty-printed if combined with `--pretty`, json-encoded if combined with `--json`

### `delete`

Is used to delete backups and WALs before them. By default, `delete` will perform a dry run. If you want to execute deletion, you have to add `--confirm` flag at the end of the command. Backups marked as permanent will not be deleted.

`delete` can operate in four modes: `retain`, `before`, `everything` and `target`.

`retain` [FULL|FIND\_FULL] %number% [--after %name|time%]

if `FULL` is specified, keep `%number%` full backups and everything in the middle. If with `--after` flag is used keep
$number$ the most recent backups and backups made after `%name|time%` (including).

`before` [FIND\_FULL] %name%

If `FIND_FULL` is specified, WAL-G will calculate minimum backup needed to keep all deltas alive. If `FIND_FULL` is not specified, and call can produce orphaned deltas, the call will fail with the list.

`everything` [FORCE]

`target` [FIND\_FULL] %name% | --target-user-data %data% will delete the backup specified by name or user data. Unlike other delete commands, this command does not delete any archived WALs.

(Only in Postgres & MySQL) By default, if delta backup is provided as the target, WAL-G will also delete all the dependant delta backups. If `FIND_FULL` is specified, WAL-G will delete all backups with the same base backup as the target.

### Examples

`everything` all backups will be deleted (if there are no permanent backups)

`everything FORCE` all backups, include permanent, will be deleted

`retain 5` will fail if 5th is delta

`retain FULL 5` will keep 5 full backups and all deltas of them

`retain FIND_FULL 5` will find necessary full for 5th and keep everything after it

`retain 5 --after 2019-12-12T12:12:12` keep 5 most recent backups and backups made after 2019-12-12 12:12:12

`before base_000010000123123123` will fail if `base_000010000123123123` is delta

`before FIND_FULL base_000010000123123123` will keep everything after base of base\_000010000123123123

`target base_0000000100000000000000C9` delete the base backup and all dependant delta backups

 `target --target-user-data "{ \"x\": [3], \"y\": 4 }"` delete backup specified by user data

`target base_0000000100000000000000C9_D_0000000100000000000000C4` delete delta backup and all dependant delta backups

`target FIND_FULL base_0000000100000000000000C9_D_0000000100000000000000C4` delete delta backup and all delta backups with the same base backup

**More commands are available for the chosen database engine. See it in [Databases](#databases)**

## Development

The following steps describe how to build WAL-G for PostgreSQL, but the process is the same for other databases. For example, to build WAL-G for MySQL, use the `make mysql_build` instead of `make pg_build`.

Optional:

* To build with brotli compressor and decompressor, set the `USE_BROTLI` environment variable.
* To build with libsodium, set the `USE_LIBSODIUM` environment variable.
* To build with lzo decompressor, set the `USE_LZO` environment variable.

### Installing

#### Ubuntu

```
# Install latest Go compiler
sudo add-apt-repository ppa:longsleep/golang-backports
sudo apt update
sudo apt install golang-go

# Install lib dependencies
sudo apt install libbrotli-dev liblzo2-dev libsodium-dev curl cmake

# Fetch project and build
# Go 1.15 and below
go get github.com/wal-g/wal-g
# Go 1.16+ - just clone repository to $GOPATH
# if you want to save space add --depth=1 or --single-branch
git clone https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/wal-g/wal-g

cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/wal-g/wal-g

# optional exports (see above)
export USE_BROTLI=1
export USE_LIBSODIUM=1
export USE_LZO=1

make deps
make pg_build
main/pg/wal-g --version
```

Users can also install WAL-G by using `make pg_install`. Specifying the `GOBIN` environment variable before installing allows the user to specify the installation location. By default, `make pg_install` puts the compiled binary in the root directory (`/`).

```
export USE_BROTLI=1
export USE_LIBSODIUM=1
export USE_LZO=1
make pg_clean
make deps
GOBIN=/usr/local/bin make pg_install
```

#### macOS

```
# brew command is Homebrew for Mac OS
brew install cmake

# Fetch project and build
# Go 1.15 and below
go get github.com/wal-g/wal-g
# Go 1.16+ - just clone repository to $GOPATH
# if you want to save space add --depth=1 or --single-branch
git clone https://github.com/wal-g/wal-g $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/wal-g/wal-g

cd $(go env GOPATH)/src/github.com/wal-g/wal-g

export USE_BROTLI=1
export USE_LIBSODIUM="true" # since we're linking libsodium later
./link_brotli.sh
./link_libsodium.sh
make install_and_build_pg

# if you need to install
GOBIN=/usr/local/bin make pg_install
```

To build on ARM64, set the corresponding `GOOS`/`GOARCH` environment variables:

```
env GOOS=darwin GOARCH=arm64 make install_and_build_pg

```

The compiled binary to run is `main/pg/wal-g`

### Testing

WAL-G relies heavily on unit tests. These tests do not require S3 configuration as the upload/download parts are tested using mocked objects. Unit tests can be run using

```
export USE_BROTLI=1
make unittest
```

For more information on testing, please consult [test](/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/test), [testtools](/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/testtools) and `unittest` section in [Makefile](/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/Makefile).

WAL-G will perform a round-trip compression/decompression test that generates a directory for data (e.g., data...), compressed files (e.g., compressed), and extracted files (e.g., extracted). These directories will only get cleaned up if the files in the original data directory match the files in the extracted one.

Test coverage can be obtained using:

```
export USE_BROTLI=1
make coverage
```

This command generates `coverage.out` file and opens HTML representation of the coverage.

### Development on Windows

[Information about installing and usage](/wal-g/wal-g/blob/master/docs/Windows.md)

## Troubleshooting

A good way to start troubleshooting problems is by setting one or both of these environment variables:

* `WALG_LOG_LEVEL=DEVEL`

Prints out the used configuration of WAL-G and detailed logs of the used command.

* `S3_LOG_LEVEL=DEVEL`

If your commands seem to be stuck it could be that the S3 is not reachable, certificate problems or other S3 related issues.
With this environment variable set you can see the Requests and Responses from S3.

## Acknowledgments

WAL-G would not have happened without the support of [Citus Data](https://www.citusdata.com/)

WAL-G came into existence as a result of the collaboration between a summer engineering intern at Citus, Katie Li, and Daniel Farina, the original author of WAL-E, who currently serves as a principal engineer on the Citus Cloud team. Citus Data also has an [open-source extension to Postgres](https://github.com/citusdata) that distributes database queries horizontally to deliver scale and performance.

WAL-G development is supported by [Yandex Cloud](https://cloud.yandex.com)

## Chat

We have a [Slack group](https://postgresteam.slack.com/messages/CA25P48P2) and [Telegram chat](https://t.me/joinchat/C03q9FOwa7GgIIW5CwfjrQ) to discuss WAL-G usage and development. To join PostgreSQL slack, use [invite app](https://postgres-slack.herokuapp.com).
