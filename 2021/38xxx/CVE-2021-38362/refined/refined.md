Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38362:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The REST API in Archer versions 6.x through 6.9 SP3 (6.9.3.0) lacks proper authorization controls, allowing low privileged users to access sensitive information.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Authorization Bypass:** The primary vulnerability is an authorization bypass, specifically through a user-controlled key, which is a lack of proper access control on the REST API.
- **Information Disclosure:** The vulnerability leads to the disclosure of sensitive information via API enumeration.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A low-privileged attacker can gain access to sensitive information, such as domain usernames, RSA Archer usernames, positions, and emails.
- This information could be used to aid in other attacks, escalating the impact of the initial vulnerability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is a remote, authenticated user.
- The vulnerability is exploited by sending a GET request to the vulnerable REST API endpoint, and enumerating IDs.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the Archer application with low privileges.
- No additional special privileges or network position is required.
