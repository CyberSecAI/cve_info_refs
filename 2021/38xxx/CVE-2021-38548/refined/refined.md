The provided content describes the "Glowworm Attack," a TEMPEST attack, but it is not directly related to a specific CVE. The content describes a vulnerability that allows for sound recovery from device power indicator LEDs.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** The power indicator LED of various devices is connected directly to the power line. The intensity of the LED is correlated to the power consumption of the device. Changes in power consumption due to audio output cause fluctuations in the LED's light intensity. Many devices lack specific countermeasures against this.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Devices that directly link their power indicator LED to the power line without filtering or isolation mechanisms are vulnerable. This creates a side channel for information leakage.
*   **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can recover sound, including speech, by analyzing the light intensity fluctuations of a device's power LED. The recovered audio can be used to eavesdrop on conversations or to gain access to other sensitive information.
*   **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is optical. An attacker needs an electro-optical sensor directed at the power indicator LED of the target device. The light fluctuations are then processed to reconstruct the audio signal.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs access to electro-optical equipment and the ability to position it to observe the target device's power LED. The attack can be performed remotely, up to 35 meters in the tested scenario with fair intelligibility and 15 meters with good intelligibility.

Additional Details:

*   The "Glowworm Attack" differs from the "Lamphone" attack. The Lamphone attack exploits vibrations in a light bulb caused by sound waves. Glowworm exploits fluctuations of a power LED due to variations in power consumption.
*   Video cameras are not suitable for this attack because they have insufficient frame rate for audio recovery.
*   Several manufacturers (Google, Logitech, JBL, Sony, Creative, TP-Link, Miracase, Raspberry Pi) and devices have been identified as vulnerable.
