Date: 08/07/2021
Affected Product: Canon TR150 Print Driver
Product Website: https://www.usa.canon.com/internet/portal/us/home/support/details/printers/mobile-compact-printer/pixma-tr150
Vulnerable Versions: Universal Print Driver v2.15.1.0 and below.
Patched Version: No patch exists
Vendor Advisory: N/A
# CVE-2021-38085 (CWE-732)
The Canon TR150 print driver 3.71.2.10 is vulnerable to a privilege escalation issue. During the add printer process, a local attacker can overwrite a DLL and, if timed properly, the overwritten DLL will be loaded into a SYSTEM process resulting in escalation of privileges. This occurs because the driver drops a world-writable DLL into %PROGRAMDATA% that gets loaded bya system process.
CVSSv3: AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H (7.8)

[00:01] - [Jake] Hello, DEF CON.
[00:02] Welcome to my talk,
[00:04] Bring Your Own Print Driver Vulnerability.
[00:07] In this talk, I'll discuss how a standard,
[00:09] low-privileged user can
install print drivers
[00:12] of their choosing, by design,
[00:14] on Windows systems.
[00:16] And I'll show how a local attacker
[00:17] can escalate to SYSTEM
[00:19] using a handful of
different print drivers.
[00:22] Now, I want to say upfront
[00:24] that I won't be talking
about PrintNightmare.
[00:26] PrintNightmare, at this point,
[00:28] is supposed to be a patched vulnerability,
[00:30] whereas what I'm going to talk
about in this presentation
[00:33] is likely a built-in feature
[00:35] that will be difficult to patch.
[00:38] I also had to record this
[00:39] shortly after PrintNightmare was released,
[00:41] so even if I wanted to incorporate it,
[00:44] there really just wasn't enough time.
[00:49] Now, this talk is roughly
broken down into four parts.
[00:53] To start, I'll discuss some research
[00:55] that influenced this talk.
[00:57] Then, we'll explore how a standard user
[00:59] can install a print driver.
[01:02] Next, we'll discuss actual exploitation,
[01:05] and I'll introduce a tool I wrote.
[01:08] Finally, I'll touch on detecting
[01:10] this sort of attack in the wild,
[01:12] and mitigations that may prevent it.
[01:15] I'll also give a quick rundown
[01:17] of the vulnerability disclosure timelines
[01:19] associated with this talk.
[01:24] Now, in my opinion, slides
are just an educational tool.
[01:28] While it's all well and
good for me to present them,
[01:31] it's also important for
the viewer to read them
[01:33] at their own pace,
[01:35] click links, read background material,
[01:37] and try out code snippets.
[01:39] There are also exploits
associated with this talk,
[01:42] and because of all that,
[01:44] the code and slides are available
[01:46] at the following GitHub repository.
[01:49] The name of the repo will
make a little bit more sense,
[01:52] later on in the talk.
[01:57] Finally, before we get too far into it,
[02:00] I'd like to introduce myself.
[02:02] My name is Jake Baines,
[02:03] and I'm a vulnerability researcher.
[02:06] I like to use the handle Albino Lobster,
[02:08] which is why you'll
see this little lobster
[02:10] almost everywhere I'm active online.
[02:13] My most well-known work is
probably my micro-tech work,
[02:17] although it isn't well-known at all,
[02:19] but I have had the good fortune
to be able to present at
[02:22] a few conferences, including DEF CON 27.
[02:26] I'm currently employed by Tregos.
[02:28] However, all the work I'm discussing today
[02:31] was done while I was employed
by Dark Wolf Solutions
[02:35] in fall 2020.
[02:37] Dark Wolf very kindly gave me
permission to share this work,
[02:39] for which I am truly grateful.
[02:42] So thank you very much to them.
[02:47] Now, there are some researchers
that cut their own path
[02:50] and break new ground,
[02:53] but I'm just not one of those people.
[02:55] To learn the printer subsystem
[02:57] and arrive at the conclusions I did,
[02:59] I had to stand on the shoulders
[03:01] of many more talented
researchers that came before me.
[03:04] I think it's important, and useful,
[03:07] to understand the work that
influenced my final outcome.
[03:10] So, let's quickly discuss
[03:12] some previous printer vulnerabilities.
[03:19] The first issue I want to
familiarize you with is
[03:21] CVE-2019-19363.
[03:28] This is a vulnerability in
a third-party print driver.
[03:31] The driver was developed by Ricoh,
[03:33] and it allows for privilege
escalation to SYSTEM
[03:36] by overriding a DLL.
[03:39] Pentagrid handled the disclosure
[03:41] and published a nice proof of concept,
[03:44] while Shelby Pace of Rapid7
developed the Metasploit module.
[03:48] It's a good vulnerability,
[03:49] but the driver has to be
installed on the system
[03:52] in order to exploit it.
[03:54] So it is sort of limited in that capacity.
[03:57] This is a good one to remember
for later in the talk,
[03:59] as we will reference it again.
[04:05] Of course, there is CVE-2020-1048,
[04:08] which is better known as PrintDemon.
[04:11] Now, it got a lengthy and a
bit of a meandering writeup
[04:14] on the Windows Internals blog.
[04:17] But if you spend some time with it,
[04:18] that blog provides really good exposure
[04:21] to some of the important
WIN API function calls
[04:23] associated with printers.
[04:26] The vulnerability itself
allows a local attacker
[04:29] to print to arbitrary files as SYSTEM,
[04:32] after restarting the spooler,
[04:34] resulting in privilege escalation.
[04:36] The image here is actually
from the VoidSec blog
[04:39] that talks about the vulnerability.
[04:42] And what you see is the
UI rejecting the attack
[04:45] due to insufficient permissions.
[04:47] However, a similar call, via the WIN API,
[04:50] was allowed, resulting
in the vulnerability.
[04:58] And of course, there was the
patch bypass for PrintDemon.
[05:01] A variety of people were
actually credited with this CVE.
[05:05] But VoidSec did the best
writeup, in my opinion.
[05:09] This is a really simple attack,
[05:10] where after the file permission
checks have been done,
[05:13] the attacker just swaps the
file port with a junction.
[05:16] And then they just execute
the normal PrintDemon attack.
[05:21] It's really just that easy.
[05:23] I like Rapid7's AttackerKB,
[05:25] because it's an easy way
[05:27] to get other attackers'
thoughts on vulnerabilities.
[05:31] As you can see, CVE-2020-1337,
[05:34] still just a local privilege escalation,
[05:37] is rated as very high.
[05:42] Finally, CVE-2020-1300 or Evil Printer,
[05:47] was presented at DEF CON 28 last year.
[05:50] Again, this is a local
privilege escalation
[05:53] using the printer subsystem,
[05:55] but this time,
[05:56] with the CAB file delivered
by remote printer.
[05:59] ZDI wrote up some technical
details about the CAB file,
[06:04] but other than Steven
Seely's Sweet November,
[06:06] I haven't seen anyone publish
a full exploit for this one.
[06:10] Now, I loved the DEF CON 28 presentation,
[06:14] and it served as a jumping
off point for my own research.
[06:21] And because Evil Printer
was so important to me
[06:23] and my thought process,
[06:25] I want to spend a few minutes
[06:27] just walking through the
attack in its entirety.
[06:35] The attack setup requires two things:
[06:37] a standard user account
on a Windows machine,
[06:40] and an Evil Printer to serve
up a malicious CAB file.
[06:45] The standard user simply uses
the Add Printer interface
[06:49] to connect to the Evil Printer,
[06:51] which triggers the CAB
download and unpackaging.
[06:56] The CAB file contains a file path
[06:58] with a directory traversal
[07:00] that gets unpacked anywhere on the system
[07:02] the attacker would like,
[07:04] essentially allowing the
attacker to plant a DLL
[07:07] or overwrite an executable
to escalate to SYSTEM.
[07:14] As Steven Seely's Tweet suggested,
[07:17] generation of a malicious
CAB is actually quite easy.
[07:21] Here, I generate a CAB file
containing a file called
[07:24] ualapi.dll,
[07:26] that, due to the path traversal,
[07:29] will get right into
the SYSTEM32 directory.
[07:32] Of course, ualapi.dll
is a known missing DLL
[07:37] that an attacker can plant
[07:39] in order to escalate to SYSTEM on reboot.
[07:45] And of course,
[07:46] if you're interested in
recreating the CAB yourself,
[07:49] here's the source of the DLL I generated.
[07:52] Anyone familiar with
Pentagrid's Ricoh exploit
[07:55] will know I basically stole
the snippet from them.
[07:58] But either way, if you go
to the linked repository,
[08:02] you'll find a project file
that will compile the DLL.
[08:06] Obviously, this is nothing
special or exciting.
[08:10] I just want to point out that this DLL
[08:12] executes whoami and writes
the output to c:\\output.txt.
[08:18] We will refer back to
this throughout the talk.
[08:24] The more complicated part
of the Evil Printer attack
[08:27] is setting up the Evil Printer.
[08:30] And as I've suggested,
[08:31] this method is lifted entirely
[08:33] from last year's DEF CON presentation.
[08:36] Now, for whatever reason,
[08:38] CutePDF Writer has implemented
delivery of a CAB file
[08:42] to remote clients via
Package Point and Print.
[08:46] So we can rely on the CutePDF Writer
[08:48] to do all of our heavy lifting.
[08:51] If you prepare a Windows
box in your control
[08:54] with the steps in this slide,
[08:56] then you'll be ready to
serve up malicious CAB files.
[09:03] The next step is the actual exploitation.
[09:06] As a standard, low-privileged user,
[09:09] using the Add Printer UI,
[09:11] connect to the Evil Printer
you just configured.
[09:18] When the attacker connects to the printer,
[09:20] the CAB file is downloaded and unpackaged,
[09:23] which means our malicious DLL
gets dropped into SYSTEM32.
[09:28] We also see this popup regarding
installation of a driver,
[09:32] which requires administrator approval.
[09:36] However, at this point,
[09:37] our attack has already been successful.
[09:40] So we can just hit Cancel.
[09:45] After rebooting the system,
[09:47] the ualapi.dll we dropped in SYSTEM32
[09:51] is loaded into a system
process and executed.
[09:55] As you see,
[09:56] the result.txt created by the DLL
[09:59] contains the result of whoami,
[10:01] which, when the DLL was executed,
[10:04] was SYSTEM.
[10:06] A successful privilege escalation,
[10:08] and a really great attack, in my opinion.
[10:11] It's only complicated by the
requirement of an Evil Printer,
[10:14] but in most attack scenarios,
[10:16] that shouldn't be a dealbreaker.
[10:23] Like I said,
[10:24] there wasn't a public exploit for this,
[10:26] at least that I was aware of,
[10:28] so I've published my own.
[10:30] It's wrapped up into a tool
that we'll talk about later.
[10:33] So I won't explain the silly name
[10:35] or how to use the exploit.
[10:37] We'll get there later.
[10:38] Just know a public exploit exists now,
[10:41] and it's in the repository
I mentioned earlier.
[10:47] So, last fall, after
this had been patched,
[10:50] I was exploring this attack surface,
[10:53] and I was thinking about
this Install Driver prompt.
[10:57] I was interested if driver installation
[11:00] always required administrative rights,
[11:02] or if I could bypass that somehow.
[11:08] So I decided to spend some time
[11:09] learning how a standard,
low-privileged user
[11:12] can install a print
driver on their system.
[11:19] But first we need to pick a driver
[11:21] that we would actually want to install.
[11:24] As an attacker,
[11:25] I'd love to install this
vulnerable Ricoh driver
[11:29] that we talked about earlier.
[11:31] As a reminder,
[11:32] the vulnerability in this
driver is a race condition
[11:35] to overwriting a DLL
during the AddPrinter call.
[11:40] If timed correctly,
[11:41] a standard user can escalate to SYSTEM.
[11:47] Now, one of the requirements
to AddPrinter is, of course,
[11:50] the driver name the new
printer will be using,
[11:57] which is all well and good
when the driver is available,
[11:59] like in this screenshot.
[12:01] The AddPrinter call would be
successful on this target.
[12:09] But when the driver isn't present,
[12:11] AddPrinter will obviously fail.
[12:14] So it should be fairly obvious
[12:15] why I'm interested in finding ways
[12:17] to install the driver
[12:18] without needing administrator privileges.
[12:22] If I can trick the system into
loading the driver somehow,
[12:27] then I can install the driver
[12:28] as a standard, low-privileged user,
[12:31] and exploit the driver's vulnerability:
[12:34] an attack that I'd like to call
[12:35] Bring Your Own Print Driver Vulnerability.
[12:42] So how can a standard user
[12:44] try to install the
vulnerable print driver?
[12:47] There actually is a surprising
amount of legitimate options.
[12:51] I listed a bunch here,
[12:53] and we're going to quickly
look at what happens
[12:56] when they're invoked by a standard user.
[13:01] First of all,
[13:02] thank you to Pentagrid
[13:03] for leaving links to the
Ricoh installer in their blog.
[13:08] That did prove very helpful to me.
[13:11] The Ricoh installer for
the vulnerable driver
[13:13] isn't so much an installer,
[13:15] but just right-clicking on an INF file
[13:18] to invoke the INF installer,
[13:21] which just so happens to
require administrative rights,
[13:24] so that's not really all that
useful for the standard user.
[13:32] Pointing the printer user
interface at the INF file
[13:35] yields similar results.
[13:37] So that's another no-go
for the standard user.
[13:43] PowerShell fails
[13:44] with a very ugly and sort
of useless error message.
[13:48] However, looking up the
command in MS documentation,
[13:52] we find this useful tidbit:
[13:54] "The INF file should exist
in the driver store."
[13:58] Well, what is that?
[14:00] Well, just hold on.
[14:01] We'll circle back to that.
[14:06] Invoking printui.dll yields
the exact same result
[14:10] as just using the UI,
[14:12] kind of what you'd expect.
[14:15] So yet another failure
for the standard user.
[14:20] And yet again,
[14:22] another failure when
trying to use prndrvr.vbs.
[14:31] And while there are too many
MS API functions for printers,
[14:36] Print Daemon specifically uses
[14:39] InstallPrinterDriverFromPackage,
[14:41] because a standard user could invoke it,
[14:44] if, as highlighted here, a
driver is in the driver store.
[14:51] So, it seems like getting the print driver
[14:54] into the driver store
would be really useful.
[14:58] How do we go about doing that?
[15:04] Well, let's talk about it.
[15:06] In this section,
[15:07] we'll finally see how
to get the Ricoh driver
[15:10] onto the system as a standard user.
[15:19] A good place to start is,
[15:21] what is the driver store?
[15:23] The answer is that it's a
trusted location on the system,
[15:27] where signed and verified
driver packages are stored.
[15:31] Adding a driver to the driver store
[15:33] is referred to as staging,
[15:37] likely so it isn't
confused with installation.
[15:40] Staging a driver in the driver store
[15:43] is not the same as installing it.
[15:50] Only administrators can stage drivers.
[15:53] Probably the best tool
[15:54] for enumerating, adding,
and removing drivers
[15:58] is the Plug 'n' Play util tool.
[16:01] In this screenshot,
[16:02] the administrator adds the
vulnerable Ricoh driver
[16:05] to the driver store.
[16:09] And once the vulnerable Ricoh
driver is in the driver store,
[16:13] a standard, low-privileged
user can install it
[16:16] while adding a new printer.
[16:18] Now, obviously, this talk
[16:20] is about a standard, low-privileged user
[16:23] adding a driver to the driver store,
[16:25] and not an administrator,
[16:27] like in the previous slide.
[16:29] But I want to highlight
how owning the driver store
[16:32] is all we need to be able to
then exploit the Ricoh driver.
[16:39] So, finally coming full circle,
[16:42] we sought to discover
if a low-privileged user
[16:45] can introduce arbitrary
drivers to the system.
[16:49] We tested multiple methods
[16:51] of installing the vulnerable Ricoh driver,
[16:55] and we checked out how
the driver store works.
[16:59] Is there any way to stage a print driver
[17:02] as a standard, low-privileged user?
[17:09] And the answer, of course, is yes.
[17:12] A standard, low-privileged
user can stage drivers
[17:15] into the driver store by
connecting to a printer
[17:18] that uses Package Point and Print,
[17:20] just like Evil Printer.
[17:23] The package of a CAB file, if signed,
[17:26] will be staged in the driver store.
[17:33] So an attacker that
controls an Evil Printer
[17:36] and a standard Windows account
[17:39] can stage drivers of their choosing.
[17:42] A client need only invoke
[17:44] the GetPrinter driver MS API function.
[17:51] The printer responds with the driver,
[17:54] and the system verifies
the driver's integrity
[17:57] before finally dropping
it into the driver store.
[18:01] It's really just that easy.
[18:03] So let's try it ourselves.
[18:05] We need to create a CAB file
[18:07] for our vulnerable Ricoh driver.
[18:13] As we talked about earlier,
[18:15] the Ricoh installer just sort of left us
[18:18] this exploded directory.
[18:21] Well, we can roll all
that up into a CAB file
[18:24] using makecab.
[18:29] Obviously, the CAB file
we generate isn't signed.
[18:34] But fortunately for us,
[18:35] Windows doesn't care about that.
[18:38] When unpackaging the CAB,
[18:40] the system will hunt
out the security catalog
[18:42] that I've highlighted.
[18:47] The Security Catalog itself is signed by
[18:50] Microsoft Windows hardware
compatibility publisher.
[18:55] And the catalog contains
[18:56] hashes of each file that the driver needs.
[19:00] Now, if you have sharp
eyes, you might ask,
[19:03] "Does it matter if the
'valid to' date has expired?"
[19:07] And the answer is, no.
[19:08] The system doesn't care at all about that.
[19:16] So we've created a Ricoh CAB
[19:18] that is cryptographically acceptable
[19:20] to the Windows printer subsystem.
[19:22] Now, we just need to
configure the Evil Printer
[19:25] just as we did earlier in the talk.
[19:28] I'll leave that as an exercise for home,
[19:31] since it's the exact same
setup we discussed before,
[19:34] and I'll share a tool in a bit
that automates all of that.
[19:43] Now, once the Evil Printer is all set up,
[19:46] we can connect to it as a
standard, low-privileged user,
[19:50] via the Add Printer UI.
[19:52] If successful,
[19:54] we should see a new entry
in the driver store.
[20:00] Here, we've established our
connection to the Evil Printer,
[20:04] and I've highlighted our Ricoh driver
[20:06] staged in the driver store.
[20:08] The only downside here
[20:10] is that we've triggered Windows Update.
[20:12] Later, we'll discuss how to
avoid triggering the update
[20:16] and really, the UI altogether.
[20:21] We can now see that our
Ricoh driver is staged
[20:24] via the Print UI.
[20:25] So a low-privileged user can
now use it to add a printer,
[20:30] and most importantly,
[20:32] exploit it to achieve SYSTEM.
[20:35] Now, that's the whole thing:
[20:37] using a remote printer to stage drivers,
[20:40] and exploiting the staged driver.
[20:43] Literally, Bring Your Own
Print Driver Vulnerability.
[20:52] Is this a vulnerability in Windows?
[20:54] Uh, yes.
[20:55] I think so.
[20:57] As I just said,
[20:58] we clearly crossed a security boundary
[21:01] by adding a driver into the driver store.
[21:04] And the result of crossing
that security boundary
[21:07] is that we're able to escalate to SYSTEM.
[21:15] But is this actually a
vulnerability in Windows?
[21:19] Uh, no.
[21:21] It's a feature that's working as designed.
[21:25] This is exactly how printers
are supposed to work.
[21:28] The system is supposed
to automatically download
[21:31] and stage the package
[21:33] so that the user can add a new printer.
[21:35] And, as we all know,
[21:37] features aren't vulnerabilities.
[21:40] We can dislike the feature,
[21:41] and believe it's flawed,
[21:43] but at the end of the day,
[21:44] a feature really just
isn't a vulnerability.
[21:51] But really, is this a
vulnerability in Windows?
[21:56] Uh, I'd say, honestly, I'm not sure.
[21:59] And I'm not sure I really
care all that much.
[22:02] But I think both arguments are true.
[22:04] At the end of the day,
[22:05] I can escalate to SYSTEM.
[22:07] You can call it a bug.
[22:09] You can call it a feature.
[22:10] The result is the same, either way:
[22:13] escalation to SYSTEM.
[22:21] Is this useful?
[22:22] Of course this is useful.
[22:24] As long as you can establish
a remote connection
[22:27] to an Evil Printer in your control,
[22:30] you can escalate to SYSTEM.
[22:33] What's more is that I'm not
sure it's a patchable issue.
[22:38] It's working as designed,
[22:39] and it works for Windows versions
[22:41] back to at least Windows 7.
[22:44] Maybe Vista.
[22:46] I actually didn't get a chance to try.
[22:48] What's more, though,
[22:50] is it makes old or unlikely
to be seen in the wild
[22:54] print drivers, like
Ricoh, really valuable,
[22:57] since now we can just pop
them on the box at will
[23:01] and exploit them.
[23:07] So that's the entire concept.
[23:09] A standard user can add a
print driver of their choosing
[23:13] and exploit it to obtain
SYSTEM privileges.
[23:18] But of course, no one
wants to do that manually.
[23:22] So I've developed a tool
that automates the process.
[23:26] The tool is called Concealed Position.
[23:29] So here's an early screenshot
of the GitHub repo and a link.
[23:34] As of August 7th, this
should be open to everyone.
[23:41] Now, Concealed Position
is developed in C++
[23:45] and has three major components.
[23:48] The first is the server,
[23:49] for configuring the Evil Printer.
[23:53] The second is the client,
[23:54] for staging the driver
[23:55] and executing the privilege escalation.
[23:59] And finally,
[24:00] the DLL that gets executed
with SYSTEM privileges.
[24:08] Concealed Position
currently has four exploits
[24:10] you can choose from.
[24:12] SlashingDamage and PoisonDamage
[24:14] are the two we've already spoken about.
[24:16] That's CVE-2020-1300, and
PoisonDamage is the Ricoh driver.
[24:24] But it also has two more
vulnerable drivers that I found,
[24:31] and while recording this,
[24:32] I'm still in the middle of
disclosing to the vendors,
[24:35] which we will talk about
at the end of this talk.
[24:39] The first one is AcidDamage,
[24:40] which is a vulnerability
[24:42] in Lexmark's universal print driver.
[24:45] And the second is RadiantDamage,
[24:47] which is a vulnerability in
Canon's TR150 print driver.
[24:52] Concealed Position can also be executed
[24:55] in a local-only mode,
[24:56] when the drivers already
exist in the driver store.
[25:03] Now, here's a sample
screenshot of the server.
[25:06] And as you can see, it's simple to invoke.
[25:09] You just select the
exploit you want to use.
[25:16] And the client is similar,
[25:18] except you need to either
specify local exploitation,
[25:22] or provide the Evil Printer address
[25:26] and the name of the Evil Printer
you're going to connect to.
[25:34] And here's the tool
after executing an attack
[25:36] using AcidDamage.
[25:38] Again, we see the DLL used
[25:41] just echoes whoami to the result.txt file
[25:44] you see pictured here.
[25:52] In one of the previous slides,
[25:53] we saw that connecting to the Evil Printer
[25:55] using the Add Printer UI
triggered Windows Update,
[26:00] which is obviously a no-go
during a real attack.
[26:05] By using the WIN API
calls listed in the slide,
[26:08] the client is able to avoid Windows Update
[26:11] and the UI altogether.
[26:13] In the first stage,
[26:15] which is the connection
to the remote printer,
[26:17] the attacker utilizes GetPrinterDriver.
[26:21] In the second phase,
[26:23] the driver is installed
from the driver store using
[26:25] InstallPrinterDriverFromPackage.
[26:29] Exploitation typically then occurs
[26:31] during the AddPrinter call.
[26:37] Now, there's a lot of love
for PowerShell out there,
[26:39] and I think it's the obvious
tool for a lot of people.
[26:43] So some might wonder why I didn't develop
[26:45] Concealed Position in PowerShell.
[26:48] Well, first of all,
[26:49] I just happen to love C++,
[26:51] and it's really sort of the
language that I think in first.
[26:55] But I think it's also good to know,
[26:57] if you do want to use PowerShell,
[27:00] the AddPrinter using ConnectionName
[27:03] will stage the driver
into the driver store.
[27:07] But it also triggers
Windows Update as well.
[27:10] But if you like PowerShell,
[27:12] that's probably easy
enough to work around.
[27:14] If you want to develop your own tool,
[27:17] you should definitely pursue that.
[27:23] All right.
[27:24] So we've talked about the attack.
[27:25] And I've showed off my tools.
[27:28] So let's talk about
[27:29] the new driver
vulnerabilities that I found.
[27:35] The first one is AcidDamage,
[27:37] and like I said earlier,
[27:39] it's an issue with Lexmark's
universal print driver,
[27:42] affecting versions 2.15.1.0 and below.
[27:47] This has been assigned CVE-2021-35449.
[27:53] The issue is that during AddPrinter,
[27:55] a world writable file is parsed for DLLs.
[27:59] An attacker can just
insert a path traversal
[28:02] to a DLL under their control,
[28:04] resulting in escalation to SYSTEM.
[28:09] Very, very simple.
[28:16] Now, obviously,
[28:17] the exploit has an implementation
in Concealed Position.
[28:21] But I've also developed
a Metasploit module
[28:23] for this as well.
[28:25] Now, the module doesn't
use an Evil Printer.
[28:27] It's just a local-only attack.
[28:30] However, one of the
challenges of recording this
[28:32] so far in the past,
[28:34] like I said,
[28:35] I'm recording this in mid-July.
[28:37] It's July 13th.
[28:39] So the challenge here is
that I can't really show
[28:41] an open pull request until August 7th.
[28:45] So I can't link it here.
[28:47] But trust me,
[28:48] when the morning of
August 7th rolls around,
[28:51] I will open that pull request.
[28:56] Now, remember, to use this
attack with the Evil Printer,
[29:00] we need to generate a CAB file.
[29:03] Now, we can cheat and just
download version 2.10.0.5
[29:08] from the Windows Update Catalog.
[29:11] So that works fine.
[29:13] So why not?
[29:19] The CAB file downloaded
from Windows Catalog
[29:21] is also signed by Microsoft.
[29:23] So that's kind of a neat
thing we can't recreate,
[29:26] just by using makecab.
[29:33] But if you want to use the latest version,
[29:36] we can do that, too.
[29:38] First, we just have to
grab the Lexmark installer,
[29:42] and it will dump the required
files off of C:\Lexmark.
[29:48] We can use the same technique as before,
[29:51] using dir to generate our files list.
[29:54] Except makecab doesn't respect directories
[29:57] unless you tell it to,
[29:58] so you have to modify the files.txt file
[30:01] to let makecab know that the driver
[30:03] needs the directory
structure to be respected.
[30:07] But that's really it.
[30:09] Pass the modified files.txt to makecab,
[30:12] and we have a CAB file to
use with Concealed Position.
[30:16] Again, our generated
CAB file isn't signed,
[30:20] but it contains a valid Security Catalog.
[30:27] The next vulnerable driver, RadiantDamage,
[30:30] is an issue I discovered in the driver
[30:32] for Canon's PIXMA TR150
mobile wireless printer.
[30:38] The TR150 driver 3.71.2.10
and below is affected.
[30:44] And again, this is a
local privilege escalation
[30:50] during the AddPrinter process.
[30:53] This issue has not been
assigned a CVE yet,
[30:55] at time of recording.
[30:58] So I guess we'll discuss that in a bit.
[31:04] Similar to the Ricoh vulnerability,
[31:06] this is a race condition to
overwrite a DLL in ProgramData.
[31:11] If you can time it correctly,
[31:12] the overwritten DLL will get
picked up by printIsolationHost
[31:16] and executed as SYSTEM.
[31:19] Again, very simple.
[31:22] I found that this is a
bit difficult to time,
[31:25] a little bit harder than AcidDamage is.
[31:29] But it usually takes no more
than a couple of minutes
[31:32] to finally hit.
[31:37] Again, we need a CAB file
[31:39] to work with Concealed Position server.
[31:41] And again, you can actually
download the TR150 driver
[31:45] from the Update Catalog.
[31:48] So we can simply download it,
[31:49] and we have a signed,
well-formed, most current version
[31:54] of a totally exploitable driver to use.
[32:02] Now, of course, it might be useful to know
[32:04] how to generate our own still.
[32:07] The Canon installer will
download the following files
[32:10] into a directory in AppData.
[32:12] Note the flat file structure.
[32:17] Because of the flat file structure,
[32:19] it's trivial to package up using makecab.
[32:23] We just do exactly what
we did for the Ricoh CAB,
[32:26] and just like that,
[32:27] we generated our own
correctly-formed TR150 CAB.
[32:36] Again, you can find the
implementation of RadiantDamage
[32:39] at the following link.
[32:41] And again, there is a Metasploit module.
[32:44] I just couldn't include the link
[32:46] because I recorded so far in the past.
[32:54] So that's all for the
exploitation sections.
[32:57] And I hope you found it interesting.
[33:01] But I now want to touch on
detection and mitigation,
[33:04] for those of us that
have to defend against
[33:06] this sort of thing in the real world.
[33:08] Now, my full-time job is not defending.
[33:13] So these are best effort.
[33:15] Forgive me if I have
overlooked anything obvious.
[33:24] So the first detection
is from the event log.
[33:27] Event ID 600 is great for
catching CVE-2020-1300,
[33:33] or what I call SlashingDamage,
[33:36] or what is known as the
original Evil Printer.
[33:40] This is the path traversal
[33:42] presented at last year's DEF CON.
[33:44] And you can even see in the description
[33:50] that it mentions that
the failure can occur
[33:52] due to a bad or missing signature,
[33:54] which is exactly what the
original Evil Printer serves up.
[34:02] Event 215 catches all the other issues,
[34:05] at least as I've coded them up.
[34:08] Here, you can see the exploitation
caused the print driver
[34:11] to fail to install correctly
during the AddPrinter process.
[34:21] You can also investigate
the setupapi.dev file
[34:25] and see windows/inf.
[34:28] Now, this could quite tedious,
[34:30] as it's very verbose and quite long.
[34:33] But it's actually great documentation
[34:35] for any driver that has been
introduced to the system,
[34:39] or even a driver that has been
attempted to be introduced
[34:43] to the system.
[34:48] And of course,
[34:49] you can detect the attack over the wire,
[34:52] as long as SMB encryption isn't enabled.
[34:56] The challenge here, of course,
[34:58] is that this attack uses
totally legitimate behavior.
[35:02] Although, depending on your environment
[35:04] and where the Evil Printer is located,
[35:06] this might be a good way
to detect the attack.
[35:09] For instance, it's probably a bad thing
[35:13] if one of your systems is
reaching out to a printer
[35:16] over the internet.
[35:24] I've also embedded a unique string
[35:25] into Concealed Position's client.
[35:28] I chose the client,
[35:29] because that's typically
the victim system.
[35:33] So if we're using YARA, or any
other signature-based system,
[35:37] you should be able to
identify use of cp\_client,
[35:40] based on this string.
[35:42] Naturally, smart attackers
[35:44] are going to review the code I've written
[35:46] and remove this line.
[35:50] But there are a lot of dumb
attackers out there, too.
[35:52] So hopefully if this ever
does get used in the wild,
[35:56] this will help stop that.
[36:03] Now, one of the challenges
with mitigations
[36:07] is I doubt this will
ever see any real patch.
[36:12] You know, installing a printer
[36:15] is meant to use these mechanisms.
[36:18] So I think the best you can do
[36:20] is just ensure that the affected drivers
[36:23] aren't on your systems already,
[36:25] and then enable
[36:26] the Package Point and Print
- Approved Servers in GPO.
[36:31] Now, of course, that will
make it very difficult
[36:33] for your end users to add printers.
[36:37] That's sort of the entire issue, isn't it?
[36:39] Printers can't be trusted.
[36:46] And finally,
[36:47] I'd like to discuss the
disclosures of the vulnerabilities,
[36:51] and suggest some future work.
[36:58] So after getting my DEF CON acceptance
[37:01] and talking to Dark Wolf,
[37:02] I sent similar disclosures to
Lexmark, Canon, and Microsoft.
[37:07] All were provided
descriptions and exploit code,
[37:10] all very similar disclosures, really.
[37:13] And they were all informed
[37:15] of the August 7th disclosure date.
[37:22] Excuse me.
[37:23] Lexmark was awesome.
[37:25] And this is exactly how
you want disclosure to go.
[37:28] They acknowledged receipt immediately.
[37:31] I sent the disclosure on a Friday,
[37:33] because I'm a monster,
[37:34] and they confirmed the issue on a Monday.
[37:37] And it only took a little more than a week
[37:40] to send me a beta patch,
[37:41] which is really impressive.
[37:44] You can see at the end here
that Lexmark intends to
[37:46] release a patch shortly
after I record this talk,
[37:49] so by the end of the week of July 12th.
[37:54] And Lexmark has been a
great communicator, overall.
[37:59] They even went as far as
[38:00] wishing me good luck on my DEF CON talk,
[38:02] which I never actually told them about.
[38:05] So I thought that was pretty clever.
[38:08] So a shoutout to Braden,
if you're listening.
[38:11] Now, the only real problem
with this disclosure
[38:14] is it took MITRE two
weeks to assign a CVE,
[38:17] which is really frustrating
[38:18] from a researcher's point of view,
[38:20] if they can't move faster than that.
[38:23] They literally have two jobs:
[38:24] assigning and publishing
CVEs that other people write.
[38:28] You know, how hard is that?
[38:31] Otherwise, great disclosure.
[38:34] Lexmark is awesome.
[38:39] So Canon and Lexmark were
sent very similar content,
[38:43] to the point that I accidentally
left the word Lexmark
[38:46] in a spot in my Canon disclosure.
[38:51] And disclosure with Canon
started off very well.
[38:53] They asked clarifying questions
on the affected component,
[38:57] but then nothing.
[39:00] By July 9th, they had the
vulnerability for three weeks
[39:03] and they hadn't confirmed the issue.
[39:06] They haven't denied the issue.
[39:09] They didn't indicate
if they tried the PoC,
[39:12] or if they'd even looked at the PoC,
[39:14] even though I keep asking.
[39:16] Now, they did release a
security patch on July 4th.
[39:19] But after looking at it,
[39:21] it doesn't affect the
vulnerability I reported.
[39:26] And they, for some reason,
[39:27] didn't mention it to me
until eight days later.
[39:31] But basically,
[39:33] I'm not sure where the
confusion lies with Canon,
[39:36] that they aren't giving
me any type of feedback
[39:39] so that I can help them,
[39:41] and I think at some point
[39:42] I'll probably have to loop in CERT/CC
[39:44] so that this gets a CVE
hopefully by August 7th.
[39:53] The Microsoft disclosure
has been reasonable.
[39:56] As you can see from the timeline,
[39:59] there was a fair amount of back and forth
[40:01] about recreating the issue.
[40:03] But eventually,
[40:04] I guess the proof of
concept video got there,
[40:07] which probably just means
[40:09] my written instructions weren't very good.
[40:12] Now, while they did acknowledge
the issue on July 12th,
[40:15] I actually don't expect
any type of CVE here
[40:18] or security bulletin.
[40:20] But really, I just wanted
Microsoft to be aware
[40:22] that this is a thing they
designed into their system,
[40:26] and that I'm going to talk
about it on August 7th.
[40:29] So, mission accomplished.
[40:34] But I honestly am not sure
how they can address this,
[40:37] without breaking normal printer workflows.
[40:43] You know, I think it is very funny
[40:44] how these three different disclosures
[40:48] were all very similar content,
[40:50] but they all had very differing results.
[40:54] So one turned out good.
[40:56] One turned out bad.
[40:57] (Jake laughs)
[40:58] And one spent a lot of
time, and can't reproduce.
[41:06] So, last slide.
[41:07] Future work.
[41:08] Like I said, any print
driver that is compatible
[41:11] with the driver store is
fair game, new or old.
[41:14] Really, very old is
even up for grabs here.
[41:18] So there are many drivers
that could be analyzed
[41:21] and added to Concealed Position.
[41:24] There's also nothing
special about CutePDF.
[41:27] It's only there
[41:27] because I couldn't get
Samba to do what I wanted,
[41:30] and didn't have the time to
write my own implementation
[41:33] of delivering a Package
Point and Print CAB file.
[41:39] Now, hopefully in the future,
[41:40] I or someone else will code that up,
[41:44] so that others can use an
Evil Printer as they choose.
[41:49] Once that is done,
[41:50] this attack would be great
paired with a USB attack.
[41:56] And finally,
[41:57] Concealed Position could use polishing.
[42:00] Like most exploits,
[42:01] it was written only to prove
that the attack was possible.
[42:06] So it's a little messy at the moment,
[42:08] and some of the mechanisms
around dropping DLL
[42:11] and customizing payloads
could be extended.
[42:16] Otherwise, that's it.
[42:18] Thank you all so much for listening.
[42:21] Thank you very much to Dark
Wolf for letting me share.
[42:23] And thank you again, DEF CON,
[42:26] for both the support and
allowing me to present.
[42:30] Again, thank you all.

### Breaking TrustZone-M: Privilege Escalation on LPC55S69

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Laura Abbott Oxide Computer Company

#### Rick Altherr Oxide Computer Company

Virtual only presentation

The concept of Trusted Execution Environments has been broadly introduced to microcontrollers with ARMâs TrustZone-M. While much experience with TrustZone-A can be applied, architectural differences with ARMv8-M lead to a very different approach to configuration and transitions between secure and non-secure worlds. This talk will deep dive into how TrustZone-M works, where to look for weaknesses in implementations, and a detailed look into NXP LPC55S69âs implementation including discovering an undocumented peripheral that leads to a priviledge escalation vulnerability exploitable with TrustedFirmware-M. Finally, NXP PSIRT will be used as a case study in how \_not\_ to respond to a vulnerability report.

### The Mechanics of Compromising Low Entropy RSA Keys

20 minutes

#### Austin Allshouse Staff Research Scientist / BitSight

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Over the past decade, there have been a number of research efforts
(and DEFCON talks!) investigating the phenomenon of RSA keys on the
Internet that share prime factors with other keys. This can occur
when devices have poorly initialized sources of ârandomnessâ when
generating keys; making it trivial to factor the RSA modulus and
recover the private key because, unlike large integer factorization,
calculating the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two moduli can be
fast and efficient. When describing their research, past hackers and
researchers have attested that they âbuilt a custom distributed
implementation of Batch-GCD;â which seems like one hell of a detail to
gloss over, right? This talk will detail a hacker's journey from
understanding and implementing distributed batch GCD to analyzing
findings from compromising RSA keys from network devices en masse.

### 2021 - Our Journey Back To The Future Of Windows Vulnerabilities and the 0-days we brought back with us

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Tomer Bar Director of Security Research @ SafeBreach

#### Eran Segal Security Researcher @ SafeBreach Labs

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

In 2020, security researchers reported a record number of Windows vulnerabilities. We were curious what superpowers will we get from researching this huge number of vulnerabilities? Can we leverage our findings to discover 0-days?

We decided to go back in time to 2016 to search for patterns and automatically classify all the public vulnerabilities since then. We believed that only by connecting the dots to a bigger picture, we will be able to come back 2021 with the success of achieving our goal.

We adopted a new approach, in terms of both the goal and how to get there. Until now, the main goal of patch-diff was focused on the root cause of the vulnerability and building a 1-day to exploit it Usually patch-diff was done manually on a single patch.

We reached higher for the holy grail. We understood that in order to find 0-days we needed to build an automated process that would gather all the insights from all the patches in a single, searchable db.

It worked! We discovered the root causes of multiple classes of vulnerabilities. We used these discoveries on a fully patched Windows 10 host in order to highlight opportunities for exploitation. As a consequence, we found and reported (1) 6 information disclosure vulnerabilities to Microsoft, (2) 2 post exploitation techniques allowing covert exfiltration of private user data, and (3) an additional surprise.

In this presentation, we'll describe our research process, demonstrate a live exploitation of the vulnerabilities we found, share the tools we developed, and explain how other researchers can use it to discover 0-days.

### Abusing SAST tools! When scanners do more than just scanning

45 minutes | Demo

#### Rotem Bar Head of Marketplace Integrations @ Cider Security

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

When we write code, we often run many scanners for different purposes on our code - from linters, to testing, security scanning, secret scanning, and more.

Scanning the code occurs on developers' machines and in CI/CD pipelines, which assumes the code is untrusted and unverified and based on this assumption scanners shouldn't have the ability to dynamically run code.

Our research focuses on the many static analyzers out there if this is really the case. Many of the scanners allow different ways of interaction - From requesting external resources, overriding the configuration and to remote code execution as part of the process.This talk will be technical and show examples of well-known scanning tools and how we created code that attacks them.

TLDR -

When integrating and using new tools in our CI systems and especially when running on unverified code, Which tools can we trust and how can we scan safe untrusted code in a secure way?

### The Unbelievable Insecurity of the Big Data Stack: An Offensive Approach to Analyzing Huge and Complex Big Data Infrastructures

45 minutes | Demo

#### Sheila A. Berta Head of Research at Dreamlab Technologies

Virtual only presentation

Honoring the term, the variety of technologies in the Big Data stack is hugely BIG. Many complex components in charge of transport, storing, and processing millions of records make up Big Data infrastructures. The speed at which data needs to be processed and how quickly the implemented technologies need to communicate with each other make security lag behind. Once again, complexity is the worst enemy of security.

Today, when conducting a security assessment on Big Data infrastructures, there is currently no methodology for it and there are hardly any technical resources to analyze the attack vectors. On top of that, many things that are considered vulnerabilities in conventional infrastructures, or even in the Cloud, are not vulnerabilities in this stack. What is a security problem and what is not a security problem in Big Data infrastructures? That is one of the many questions that this research answers. Security professionals need to count on a methodology and acquire the necessary skills to competently analyze the security of such infrastructures.

This talk presents a methodology, and new and impactful attack vectors in the four layers of the Big Data stack: Data Ingestion, Data Storage, Data Processing and Data Access. Some of the techniques that will be exposed are the remote attack of the centralized cluster configuration managed by ZooKeeper; packet crafting for remote communication with the Hadoop RPC/IPC to compromise the HDFS; development of a malicious YARN application to achieve RCE; interfering data ingestion channels as well as abusing the drivers of HDFS-based storage technologies like Hive/HBase, and platforms to query multiple data lakes as Presto. In addition, security recommendations will be provided to prevent the attacks explained.

REFERENCES:

I plan to release a white paper at the conference, in the white paper there will be all the references. Anyway, as the attacks are novel, the references are related to infrastructure stuff mostly, not so much about security.

#### Matthew Bryant Red Team @ Snapchat

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Youâve seen plenty of talks on exploiting, escalating, and exfiltrating the magical world of Google Cloud (GCP), but what about its buttoned-down sibling? This talk delves into the dark art of utilizing Apps Script to exploit G Suite (AKA Google Workspace).

As a studious sorcerer, youâll discover how to pierce even the most fortified G Suite enterprises. Youâll learn to conjure Apps Script payloads to bypass powerful protective enchantments such as U2F, OAuth app allowlisting, and locked-down enterprise Chromebooks.

Our incantations donât stop at the perimeter, we will also discover novel spells to escalate our internal privileges and bring more G Suite accounts under our control. Once weâve obtained the access we seek, weâll learn various curses to persist ourselves whilst keeping a low profile so as to not risk an unwelcome exorcism.

You donât need divination to see that this knowledge just might rival alchemy in value.

### PunkSPIDER and IOStation: Making a Mess All Over the Internet

45 minutes | Demo,Tool

#### \_hyp3ri0n aka Alejandro Caceres Director of Computer Network Exploitation at QOMPLX, former owner of Hyperion Gray

#### Jason Hopper Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

We've been getting asked a lot for "that tool that was like Shodan but for web app vulns.â In particular WTF happened to it? Punkspider (formerly known as PunkSPIDER but renamed because none of us could remember where tf the
capital letters go) was taken down a couple of years ago due to multiple ToS issues and threats. It was originally funded by DARPA. We werenât sure in which direction to keep expanding, and it ended up being a nightmare to
sustain. We got banned more than a 15 year old with a fake ID trying to get into a bar. It became a pain and hardly sustainable without a lot of investment in time and money. Each time we got banned it meant thousands of dollars
and countless hours moving sh\*\* around.

Now weâve solved our problems and completely re-engineered/expanded the system. It is not only far more efficient with real-time distributed computing and checks for way more vulns, we had to take some creative ways through the
woods â this presentation covers both the tool itself and the story of the path we had to take to get where it is, spoiler alert: it involves creating our own ISP and data center in Canada and integrating freely available data
that anyone can get but most donât know is available. Come play with us and see what the wild west of the web looks like and listen to our story, itâs fun and full of angry web developers. Weâll also be releasing at least 10s
of thousands of vulnerabilities and will be taking suggestions from the audience on what to search. Fun vulns found get a t-shirt, super fun ones get a hoodie thrown at them.

### Hack the hackers: Leaking data over SSL/TLS

20 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Ionut Cernica PHD Student @Department of Computer Science, Faculty of Automatic Control and Computer Science, University Politehnica of Bucharest

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Have you considered that in certain situations the way hackers exploit vulnerabilities over the network can be predictable? Anyone with access to encrypted traffic can reverse the logic behind the exploit and thus obtain the same data as the exploit.

Various automated tools have been analyzed and it has been found that these tools operate in an unsafe way. Various exploit databases were analyzed and we learned that some of these are written in an insecure (predictable) way.

This presentation will showcase the results of the research, including examples of exploits that once executed can be harmful. The data we obtain after exploitation can be accessible to other entities without the need of decrypting the traffic. The SSL/TLS specs will not change. There is a clear reason for that and in this presentation I will argue this, but what will change for sure is the way hackers will write some of the exploits.

**Ionut Cernica**
 Ionut Cernica started his security career with the bug bounty program from Facebook. His passion for security led him to get involved in dozens of such programs and he found problems in very large companies such as Google, Microsoft, Yahoo, AT&T, eBay, VMware. He has also been testing web application security for 9 years and has had a large number of projects on the penetration testing side.

Another stage of his career was to get involved in security contests and participated in more than 100 such contests. He also reached important finals such as Codegate, Trend Micro and Defcon with the PwnThyBytes team. He also won several individual competitions, including the mini CTF from the first edition of Appsec village - Defcon village.

Now he is doing research in the field of web application security, being also a PhD student at University Polytechnic of Bucharest. Through his research he wants to innovate in the field and to bring a new layer of security to web applications. He has also been working as a Security Researcher @Future Networks 5G Lab for a few months now and hopes to make an important contribution to the 5G security area through research.

### Taking Apart and Taking Over ICS & SCADA Ecosystems: A Case Study of Mitsubishi Electric

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Mars Cheng Threat researcher for TXOne Networks

#### Selmon Yang Staff Engineer at TXOne Networks

Virtual only presentation

Diversified Industrial Control System (ICS) providers create a variety of ecosystems, which have come to operate silently in the background of our lives. Among these organizations, Mitsubishi Electric ranks among the most prolific. Because the operation of this ecosystem is so widely used in key manufacturing, natural gas supply, oil, water, aviation, railways, chemicals, food and beverages, and construction, it is closely-related to people's lives. For this reason, the security of this ecosystem is extraordinarily important.

This research will enter the Mitsubishi ecosystemâs communication protocol, using it as a lens with which to deeply explore the differences between itself and other ecosystems. We will show how we successfully uncovered flaws in its identity authentication function, including how to take it over and show that such an attack can cause physical damage in different critical sectors. Weâll explain how we accomplished this by applying reverse engineering and communication analysis. This flaw allows attackers to take over any asset within the entire series of Mitsubishi PLCs, allowing command of the ecosystem and full control of the relevant sensors. A further complication is that making a fix to the various communication protocols in the ICS/SCADA is extremely difficult. We will also share the various problems we encountered while researching these findings and provide the most workable detection and mitigation strategies for those protocols.

### Crossover Episode: The Real-Life Story of the First Mainframe Container Breakout

45 minutes | Demo

#### Ian Coldwater Hacker

#### Chad Rikansrud (Bigendian Smalls) Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

You've seen talks about container hacking. You've seen talks about mainframe hacking. But how often do you see them together? IBM decided to put containers on a mainframe, so a container hacker and a mainframe hacker decided to join forces and hack it. We became the first people on the planet to escape a container on a mainframe, and weâre going to show you how.

Containers on a mainframe? For real. IBM zCX is a Docker environment running on a custom Linux hypervisor built atop z/OS - IBMâs mainframe operating system. Building this platform introduces mainframe environments to a new generation of cloud-native developers-and introduces new attack surfaces that werenât there before.

In this crossover episode, weâre going to talk about how two people with two very particular sets of skills went about breaking zCX in both directions, escaping containers into the mainframe host and spilling the secrets of the container implementation from the mainframe side.

When two very different technologies get combined for the first time, the result is new shells nobodyâs ever popped before.

Mired in the hell of a global pandemic, hospital capacity stressed to its limit, doctors and nurses overworked and exhausted... surely the baddies would cut us a little slack and leave little 'ol healthcare alone for a bit, right? Well, raise your hand if you saw this one coming. Another year of rampaging ransomware, of pwned patient care- only this time backdropped by the raging dumpster fire that is COVID. Can we once and for all dispel with the Pollyannas telling us that nobody would knowingly seek to harm patients? And if we can't convince the powers that be- whether in the hospital C-suite or in DC- that we need to take this $%& seriously now, then what hope do we have for pushing patient safety to the forefront when things return to some semblance of normal? With a heavily curated panel including policy badasses, elite hackers, and seasoned clinicians - D0 N0 H4RM remains the preeminent forum where insight from experts collide with the ingenuity and imagination of the DEF CON grassroots to inspire activism and collaboration stretching far beyond closing ceremonies.

Moderated by physician hackers quaddi and r3plicant, this perennially packed event always fills up fast - so make sure you join us. As always- the most important voice is yours.

### No Key? No PIN? No Combo? No Problem! P0wning ATMs For Fun and Profit

45 minutes | Demo

#### Roy Davis Senior Security Engineer, Zoom Video Communications

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Since the late great Barnaby Jack gave us âJack Pottingâ in the late 2000s, there have been several talks on ATM network attacks, USB port attacks, and digital locks attacks which apply to several brands of ATM safes. In this session, Iâll discuss and demonstrate how most of these known attack vectors have been remediated, while several fairly simple attacks against the machine and the safe still remain. Weâll dive into how ATMs work, the steps I went through to become a âlicenced ATM operatorâ which enabled my research, and how I identified the vulnerabilities. Iâll show how, with very little technical expertise and 20 minutes, these attacks lead directly past âsecureâ and allow attackers to collect a lot more than $200.

### Unlocking KeeLoq â A Reverse Engineering Story

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Rogan Dawes Researcher, Orange Cyberdefenseâs SensePost Team

Virtual only presentation

KeeLoq Remote Keyless Entry systems make use of radio frequency transmissions to operate and have many known weaknesses. A 64-bit manufacturer key is used in transmissions to encrypt an incrementing transmission sequence number in order to provide replay protection. This presentation is a journey into bringing existing research together to make personal Keeloq projects practical, ultimately repurposing a commercial receiver as part of a home automation system integration project.

I will demonstrate how I recovered the manufacturer key by extracting and reverse engineering the receiverâs firmware using a JTAG adapter and Ghidra. Next, I will cover decoding and decrypting the KeeLoq transmissions (verified using a logic analyzer), cloning the captured serial and sequence numbers to a new transmitter, and finally, how to export the received transmissions to a home automation system via an add-on WiFi-capable microcontroller.

### Instrument and Find Out: Writing Parasitic Tracers for High(-Level) Languages

20 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Jeff Dileo Technical Director, NCC Group

Virtual only presentation

Modern programming languages are, more and more, being designed not just around performance, ease-of-use, and (sometimes) security, but also performance monitoring and introspectability. But what about the languages that never adopted such concepts from their peers? Or worse, what about the languages that tacked on half-hearted implementations as an afterthought? The answer is simple, you write your own and instrument them into the language dynamically.

In this talk, we will discuss the process for developing generalized parasitic tracers targeting specific programming languages and runtimes using Ruby as our case study. We will show how feasible it is to write external tracers targeting a language and its runtime, and discuss best practices for supporting different versions over time.

### Vulnerability Exchange: One Domain Account For More Than Exchange Server RCE

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Tianze Ding Senior security researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

Virtual only presentation

Microsoft Exchange Server is one of the most famous mail servers in the world. It not only stores a large amount of sensitive corporate information, but also plays an important role in Microsoft Active Directory, so it has become a high-value target for both APT groups and red teams.

In the past few months, some high-risk vulnerabilities in Exchange Server have been exposed, which mainly target vulnerable ASP.NET code. But the architecture of Exchange Server is complicated, and its attack surface is not limited to ASP.NET, this talk will analyze and attack Exchange Server from a different perspective.

I will share the following two new vulnerabilities I found, as well as the new attack surfaces and how I chained several techniques to successfully exploit them in detail.

1. One of them can result in arbitrary mailbox takeover, attackers can read emails, download attachments, send emails, etc. as any Exchange user.

2. The other can lead to remote code execution on Exchange Server, attackers can gain local administrator privileges and execute arbitrary commands. Furthermore, there is an interesting point, even if you have applied the latest Exchange Server patches, your Exchange Server may still be compromised by this type of attack.

For red teams, Exchange Server RCE is only the beginning. Usually, there are some high-privileged domain users and groups on Exchange Server, I will also introduce a new method in depth to help you perform lateral movement and even privilege escalation to Domain Admin after achieving Exchange Server RCE.

These vulnerabilities have been reported to MSRC and the exploit tools will be released after the talk.

### Response Smuggling: Pwning HTTP/1.1 Connections

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Martin Doyhenard Security Researcher at Onapsis

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Over the past few years, we have seen some novel presentations re-introducing the concept of HTTP request smuggling, to reliably exploit complex landscapes and systems. With advanced techniques, researchers were able to bypass restrictions and breach the security of critical web applications.

This presentation will take a new approach, focusing on the response pipeline desynchronization, a rather unexplored attack vector in HTTP Smuggling.

First, I will introduce a Desync variant, using connection-tokens to hide arbitrary headers from the backend. This technique does not abuse discrepancy between HTTP parsers, but instead relies on a vulnerability in the protocol itself!

The issue was found and reported under Googleâs Vulnerability Reward Program for a nice bounty!

Next, I will show how it is possible to inject multiple messages at the backend server, mixing the pipelineâs connection order, and hijack users sessions from login requests.

Finally, using a novel technique known as Response Scripting, I will demonstrate how to create malicious outbound messages using static responses as the building blocks. This will be leveraged to write custom responses and take control of one of the most popular protocols in history!

### Worming through IDEs

20 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### David Dworken Security Engineer, Google

Virtual only presentation

You might think that as long as you never hit run, opening up that interesting new POC in your IDE and checking out the code is safe. But it isn't. IDEs and developer tools are complex pieces of software that have vulnerabilities, just like everything else.

We'll start by discussing what a reasonable threat model is for IDEs. How do companies threat model their IDEs? What do users expect of their IDEs? Is viewing a file equivalent to executing it?

Then we'll dive into the reality of it. Nearly every IDE examined was trivially vulnerable. But there were also a variety of subtle bugs lying underneath. We'll look at bugs in both local IDEs (like VSCode and IntelliJ) and cloud-based IDEs (like AWS Cloud9 and Github Codespaces).

Finally, we'll show how an attacker could make a worm that would spread through attacking IDEs. View a malicious project? Let's automatically backdoor every project on a computer and keep spreading.

### eBPF, I thought we were friends !

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Guillaume Fournier Security Engineer at Datadog

#### Sylvain Afchain Staff Engineer at Datadog

#### Sylvain Baubeau Staff Engineer at Datadog

Virtual only presentation

Since its first appearance in Kernel 3.18, eBPF (Extended Berkley Packet Filter) has progressively become a key technology for observability in the Linux kernel. Initially dedicated to network monitoring, eBPF can now be used to monitor and trace any kind of kernel space activity.

Over the past few years, many vendors have started using eBPF to speed up their services or introduce innovative features. Cilium, Calico, Cloudflare, Netflix and Facebook are leading the charge, showing off new complex networking use cases on a monthly basis. On the security side of things, Google recently contributed the Kernel Runtime Security Instrumentation which opens the door to writing Linux Security Modules with eBPF.

In other words, eBPF is the new kid in town and a growing number of companies are running services with eBPF access in production. This leads us to a simple question: how bad can things get if one of those services were to be compromised ? This talk will cover how we leveraged eBPF to implement a full blown rootkit with all the features you would expect: various obfuscation techniques, command and control with remote and persistent access, data theft and exfiltration techniques, Runtime Application Self-Protection evasion techniques, and finally two original container breakout techniques.

Simply put, our goal is to demonstrate that rogue kernel modules might have finally found a worthy opponent. We will also detail how to detect such attacks and protect your infrastructure from them, while safely enjoying the exciting capabilities that eBPF has to offer.

### DoS: Denial of Shopping â Analyzing and Exploiting (Physical) Shopping Cart Immobilization Systems

20 minutes

#### Joseph Gabay Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Many supermarkets and shopping centers have implemented devices that âlockâ their shopping carts if theyâre taken outside of an approved boundary (e.g, a parking lot). This talk examines some of the technology thatâs used to do this, as well as ways to capture and spoof the control signals to defeat these devices.

We will go over the anatomy of remotely lockable shopping cart wheels, their basic theory, and get into how theyâre controlled. Weâll deconstruct some samples of the lock and unlock signals captured using a homemade antenna and a HackRF, and briefly discuss methods of rebroadcasting them â as well as the challenges inherent to this process.

### Robots with lasers and cameras (but no security): Liberating your vacuum from the cloud

45 minutes | Tool, Exploit

#### Dennis Giese Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Vacuum robots are becoming increasingly popular and affordable as their technology grows ever more advanced, including sensors like lasers and cameras. It is easy to imagine interesting new projects to exploit these capabilities. However, all of them rely on sending data to the cloud. Do you trust the companies promise that no video streams are uploaded to the cloud and that your personal data is safe? Why not collect the dust with open-source software?

I previously showed ways to root robots such as Roborock and Xiaomi, which enabled owners to use their devices safely with open-source home automation. In response, vendors began locking down their devices with technologies like Secure Boot, SELinux, LUKS encrypted partitions and custom crypto that prevents gaining control over our own devices. This talk will update my newest methods for rooting these devices.

The market of vacuum robots expanded in the past 2 years. In particular, the Dreame company has recently released many models with interesting hardware, like ToF cameras and line lasers. This can be a nice alternative for rooting. I will show easy ways to get root access on these devices and bypass all security. I will also discuss backdoors and security issues I discovered from analysis. You will be surprised what the developers left in the firmware.

### Defeating Physical Intrusion Detection Alarm Wires

45 minutes | Tool

#### Bill Graydon Principal, Research, GGR Security

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Alarm systems are ubiquitous - no longer the realm of banks and vaults only, many people now have them in their homes or workplaces. But how do they work? And the logical follow-up question - how can they be hacked?

This talk focuses on the communication lines in physical intrusion detection systems: how they are secured, and what vulnerabilities exist. Weâll discuss the logic implemented in the controllers and protections on the communication lines including end of line resistors - and all the ways that this aspect of the system can be exploited.

In particular, weâll release schematics for a tool weâve developed that will enable measuring end-of-line resistor systems covertly, determining the necessary re-wiring to defeat the sensors, and deploy it without setting off the alarm.

After the talk, you can head over to the Lock Bypass Village to try these techniques out for yourself!

### Phantom Attack: Evading System Call Monitoring

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Rex Guo Head of Research, Confluera

#### Junyuan Zeng Senior Software Engineer, Linkedin

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Phantom attack is a collection of attacks that evade Linux system call monitoring. A user mode program does not need any special privileges or capabilities to reliably evade system call monitoring using Phantom attack by exploiting insecure tracing implementations.

After adversaries gain an initial foothold on a Linux system, they typically perform post-exploitation activities such as reconnaissance, execution, privilege escalation, persistence, etc. It is extremely difficult if not impossible to perform any non-trivial adversarial activities without using Linux system calls.

Security monitoring solutions on Linux endpoints typically offer system call monitoring to effectively detect attacks. Modern solutions often use either ebpf-based programs or kernel modules to monitor system calls through tracepoint and/or kprobe. Any adversary operations including abnormal and/or suspicious system calls reveal additional information to the defenders and can trigger detection alerts.

We will explain the generic nature of the vulnerabilities exploited by Phantom attack. We will demonstrate Phantom attack on two popular open source Linux system call monitoring solutions Falco (Sysdig) and Tracee (Aquasecurity). We will also explain the differences between Phantom v1 and v2 attacks. Finally, we will discuss mitigations for Phantom attack and secure tracing in the broader context beyond system call tracing.

### TEMPEST radio station

45 minutes | Tool

#### Paz Hameiri Hacker

Virtual only presentation

TEMPEST is a cyber security term that refers to the use of electromagnetic energy emissions generated by electronic devices to leak data out of a target device.
The attacks may be passive (where the attacker receives the emissions and recovers the data) or active (where the attacker uses dedicated malware to target and emit specific data).

In this talk I present a new side channel attack that uses GPU memory transfers to emit electromagnetic waves which are then received and processed by the attacker.
Software developed for this work encodes audio on one computer and transmits it to the reception equipment positioned fifty feet away.
The signals are received and processed and the audio is decoded and played. The maximum bit rate achieved was 33kbit/s and more than 99% of the packets were received.

Frequency selection not only enables maximization of signal quality over distance, but also enables the attacker to receive signals from a specific computer when several computers in the area are active. The software developed demonstrates audio packets transfers, but other types of digital data may be transmitted using the same technique.

#### Richard Henderson

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

For decades, the EICAR test string has been used by antivirus and security vendors to safely test their detection engines without having to use live virulent samples which could cause harm. What would happen if you took that string, encoded it into a machine readable format like a QR code and started scanning various devices with the QR code? This talk shows how there are a lot of systems out there that aren't expecting an input string like EICAR and how many of them just collapse when shown the code. We will also discuss the types of systems you can target and how you may be able to extend this to more than a nuisance attack.

### Sleight of ARM: Demystifying Intel Houdini

45 minutes | Demo

#### Brian Hong Security Consultant, NCC Group

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

In the recent years, we have seen some of the major players in the industry switch from x86-based processors to ARM processors. However, you might be surprised to know that Intel has long supported ARM to x86 transition with their binary translator, Houdini, which runs ARM binaries on x86.

In this talk, we will discuss Intel's proprietary Houdini translator, which is primarily used by Android on x86 platforms, such as higher-end Chromebooks and desktop Android emulators. We will start with a high-level discussion of how Houdini works and is loaded into processes. We will then dive into the low-level internals of the Houdini engine and memory model, including several security weaknesses it introduces into processes using it. Lastly, we will discuss methods to escape the Houdini environment, execute arbitrary ARM and x86, and write Houdini-targeted malware that bypasses existing platform analysis.

### Caught you - reveal and exploit IPC logic bugs inside Apple

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Zhipeng Huo Senior Researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

#### Yuebin Sun Senior Researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

#### Chuanda Ding Senior Researcher, Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

Virtual only presentation

Apple's iOS, macOS and other OS have existed for a long time. There are numerous interesting logic bugs hidden for many years.
We demonstrated the world's first public 0day exploit running natively on Apple M1 on a MacBook Air (M1, 2020). Without any modification, we exploited an iPhone 12 Pro with the same bug.

In this talk, we will show you the advantage and beauty of the IPC logic bugs, how we rule all Apple platforms, Intel and Apple Silicon alike, even with all the latest hardware mitigations enabled, without changing one line of code.
We would talk about the security features introduced by Apple M1, like Pointer Authentication Code (PAC), System Integrity, and Data Protection. How did they make exploiting much harder to provide better security and protect user's privacy.
We will talk about different IPC mechanisms like Mach Message, XPC, and NSXPC. They are widely used on Apple platforms which could be abused to break the well designed security boundaries.

We will walk you through some incredibly fun logic bugs we have discovered, share the stories behind them and methods of finding them, and also talk about how to exploit these logic bugs to achieve privilege escalation.

### New Phishing Attacks Exploiting OAuth Authentication Flows

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Jenko Hwong Netskope Threat Research team

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

OAuth 2.0 device authorization gives users on limited-input devices like TVs an easier way to authenticate against and authorize a cloud website/app by entering a code on a computer/phone. This authentication and authorization flow leads to new phishing attacks that:

- do not need server infrastructure--the login page is served by the authorization provider using their domain and cert

- do not require a client application--application identities can be reused/spoofed

- do not require user consent of application permissions

Since the phish attacks hijack oauth session tokens, MFA will be ineffective as the attacker does not need to reauthenticate. The ability to defend against these attacks is hindered by limited info and functionality to detect, mitigate, and prevent session token compromise.

I'll demonstrate these new phishing attacks, access to sensitive user data, and lateral movement.

Defensive measures against these phishing attacks will be discussed, specifically the challenges in detection, mitigation, and prevention, and the overall lack of support for managing temporary credentials.

Open-source tools have been developed and will be used to demonstrate how users can:

- self-phish their organizations using these techniques

- audit security settings that help prevent/mitigate the attacks

Virtual only presentation

Apple introduced an Ultra Wideband (UWB) chip in the iPhone 11. Its cryptographically secured spatial measurement capabilities are accessible via the Nearby Interaction framework since iOS 14. As of now, it only supports interaction with other Apple devices including the latest Apple Watch and HomePod mini. These are the first steps to support UWB in a larger ecosystem, as measuring precise distance and direction can be an enabler for various future applications. The automotive industry already announced UWB support for mobile car keys on the iPhone.

But whatâs really inside Appleâs U1 chip, internally called Rose? In this talk, we will travel through time, space, firmware and kernel componentsâand fight daemons to modify firmware interaction from user space. This will not only cover one or two, but three firmwares that process or forward each Rose time measurement: The Rose Digital Signal Processor (DSP), Rose Application Processor (AP), and the Always-On Processor (AOP).

### Rotten code, aging standards, & pwning IPv4 parsing across nearly every mainstream programming language

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Kelly Kaoudis

#### Sick Codes Hacker

Virtual only presentation

Openness to responsibly disclosed external vulnerability research is crucial for modern software maintainers and security teams. Changes in upstream dependency code may have pulled the safety rug out from underneath widely trusted core libraries, leaving millions of services vulnerable to unsophisticated attacks. The impact of even a single reasonably well-distributed supply-chain security vulnerability will be felt by engineering teams across many applications, companies, and industries.

We'd like to discuss an IP address parsing vulnerability first discovered in private-ip, a small and infrequently maintained yet critically important NodeJS package for determining if an IP address should be considered part of a private range or not. We'll talk about not only the implications of this CVE but taking the main idea and applying it across multiple programming languages in uniquely disturbing ways.

Sometimes, the effects of code rot are even more far-reaching than we could possibly expect, and if you pull on a thread, it just keeps going. Sometimes, you get lucky when you know exactly what you're looking for. Sometimes, it's hard to convince other technically-minded folks that a seemingly trivial implementation flaw is dangerous in capable hands.

This talk is beginner as well as advanced-friendly; we'll show you the basics a hacker or a programmer needs to know about IP address parsing and how to tell your octal from your decimal along the way.

### HTTP/2: The Sequel is Always Worse

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### James Kettle Director of Research, PortSwigger Web Security

Virtual only presentation

HTTP/2 is easily mistaken for a transport-layer protocol that can be swapped in with zero security implications for the website behind it. Two years ago, I presented HTTP Desync Attacks and kicked off a wave of request smuggling, but HTTP/2 escaped serious analysis. In this presentation, I'll take you beyond the frontiers of existing HTTP/2 research, to unearth horrifying implementation flaws and subtle RFC oversights.

I'll show you how these flaws enable HTTP/2-exclusive desync attacks, with case studies targeting high-profile websites powered by servers ranging from Amazon's Application Load Balancer to WAFs, CDNs, and bespoke stacks by big tech. I'll demonstrate critical impact by hijacking thick clients, poisoning caches, and stealing plaintext passwords to net multiple max-bounties.

After that, I'll unveil novel techniques and tooling to crack open a widespread but overlooked request smuggling variant affecting both HTTP/1 and HTTP/2 that is typically mistaken for a false positive.

Finally, I'll drop multiple exploit-primitives that resurrect a largely-forgotten class of vulnerability, and use HTTP/2 to expose fresh application-layer attack surface.

I'll leave you with an open-source scanner, a custom, open-source HTTP/2 stack, and free interactive labs so you can hone your new skills on live systems.

The HTTP/2 RFC is essential reading: https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7540

### Over-the-air remote code execution on the DEF CON 27 badge via Near Field Magnetic Inductance or Worldâs first NFMI exploitation, sorta or OTARCEDC27NFMIOMGWTFBBQ

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Seth Kintigh Hardware Security Engineer, Dell

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

The DEF CON 27 badge employed an obscure form of wireless communication: Near Field Magnetic Inductance (NFMI). The badges were part of a contest and while poking through the firmware for hints I noticed a buffer overflow flaw. All it required to exploit it was an oversized packetâ¦ via a chip with no datasheet and no documentation on the proprietary protocol. Thus started a 2 year odyssey.

I used Software Defined Radio tools to study the signalâs modulations. I built a receiver in GNURadio and Python to convert signals into symbols, symbols obfuscated by a pattern that I had to deduce while only controlling a fraction of the bytes. Data was encoded in those symbols using proprietary convolution for even bits and Trellis Code Modulation for odd bits. I then reversed their bizarre CRC and wrote tools to craft and send packets. Using those tools I chained bugs in 2 chips and remotely crashed the badge. However, limitations in the NFMI protocol made more sophisticated attacks impossible.

But after a year and a half invested, I was not about to give up. I soldered leads to middle layer traces, extracted and reverse engineered the NFMI firmware, fixed their protocol, and patched a badge FW to patch the NFMI FW. At long last I achieved what may be the worldâs first, over-the-air, remote code exploit via NFMI.

#### Bill "Woody" Woodcock Chair of the Foundation Council, Quad9, Packet Clearing House

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

As if 2020 and 2021 were not bad enough, the Covid-19 pandemic seemed to have been accompanied by a new rash of bad cyber- attacks on major platforms like Solarwinds and Microsoft, infrastructures worldwide subverted in ransomware campaigns, and even the very organizations researching and fighting the pandemic have been hit.

Meanwhile, the hard work of cyber diplomacy continues, with talks on war and peace in the United Nations reaching a new stage as two working groups presented their final report and a third one is in the process of being born. Mostly the topics are on establishing norms on cyber behavior, rules of the road of what states can do in cyberspace.Â  But where are the hackers in all this? The Internet is famously not run by intergovernmental organizations, so the companies, civil society groups and others should somehow be involved â and one of the UN processes did in fact make a small step in that direction. But the staid ways of pin-striped cyber are hard to change. What is the best way for the community to engage?

### Fuzzing Linux with Xen

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Tamas K Lengyel Senior Security Researcher, Intel

Virtual only presentation

Last year we've successfully upstreamed a new feature to Xen that allows high-speed fuzzing of virtual machines (VMs) using VM-forking. Recently through collaboration with the Xen community external monitoring of VMs via Intel(r) Processor Trace has also been upstreamed. Combined with the native Virtual Machine Introspection (VMI) capability Xen now provides a unique platform for fuzzing and binary analysis.

To illustrate the power of the platform we'll present the details of a real-world fuzzing operation that targeted Linux kernel-modules from an attack-vector that has previously been hard to reach: memory exposed to devices via Direct Memory Access (DMA) for fast I/O. If the input the kernel reads from DMA-exposed memory is malformed or malicious - what could happen?

So far we discovered: 9 NULL-pointer dereferences; 3 array index out-of-bound accesses; 2 infinite-loops in IRQ context and 2 instances of tricking the kernel into accessing user-memory but thinking it is kernel memory. The bugs have been in Linux for many years and were found in kernel modules used by millions of devices. All bugs are now fixed upstream.

This talk will walk you through how the bugs were found: what process we went through to identify the right code-locations; how we analyzed the kernel source and how we analyzed the runtime of the kernel with Xen to pinpoint the input points that read from DMA. The talk will explain the steps required to attach a debugger through the hypervisor to collect kernel crash logs and how to perform triaging of bugs via VM-fork execution-replay, a novel technique akin to time-travel debugging. Finally, we'll close with the release of a new open-source tool to perform full-VM taint analysis using Xen and Intel(r) Processor Trace.

### Hacking Humans with AI as a Service

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Eugene Lim Cybersecurity Specialist, Government Technology Agency of Singapore

#### Glenice Tan Cybersecurity Specialist, Government Technology Agency of Singapore

#### Tan Kee Hock Cybersecurity Specialist, Government Technology Agency of Singapore

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

As the proliferation of Artificial Intelligence as a Service (AIaaS) products such as OpenAI's GPT-3 API places advanced synthetic media generation capabilities in the hands of a global audience at a fraction of the cost, what does the future hold for AI-assisted social engineering attacks? In our talk, we will present the nuts and bolts of an AIaaS phishing pipeline that was successfully deployed in multiple authorized phishing campaigns. Using both paid and free services, we emulated the techniques that even low-skilled, limited resource actors could adopt to execute effective AI-assisted phishing campaigns at scale. By repurposing easily-accessible personality analysis AIaaS products, we generated persuasive phishing emails that were automatically personalized based on a target's public social media information and created by state-of-the-art natural language generators. We will also discuss how an AI-assisted phishing workflow would impact traditional social engineering teams and operations. Finally, we look at how AIaaS suppliers can mitigate the misuse of their products.

### Do you like to read? I know how to take over your Kindle with an e-book

20 minutes

#### Slava Makkaveev Security Researcher, Check Point

Virtual only presentation

Since 2007, Amazon has sold tens of millions of Kindles, which is impressive. But this also means that tens of millions of people can be hacked through a software bug in those same Kindles. Their devices can be turned into bots, their private local networks can be compromised, and perhaps even information in their billing accounts can be stolen.

The easiest way to remotely reach a user's Kindle is through an e-book. A malicious book can be published and made available for free access in any virtual library, including the Kindle Store, or sent directly to the end-user device via Amazon services.
While you might not be happy with the writing in a particular book, nobody expects to download one that is malicious. No such scenarios have been publicized. Antiviruses do not have signatures for e-books.
But... we succeeded in making a malicious book for you. If you open this book on a Kindle device, it causes a hidden piece of code to be executed with root rights. From this moment on, you lost your e-reader, account and more.

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

According to a former senior White House official, 2020 was the year that ransomware went from being a nuisance to a full-scale national security threat and a âscourgeâ. After an awkward adolescence spent shaking down individual users for a couple hundred dollars and a big debut in 2017 with WannaCry and NotPetya , ransomware really hit the big time in 2020. Ransom payments may have topped $400 million plus that year. But those sums are nothing compared to the damage that ransomware campaigns can cause, especially when they hit critical infrastructure like Colonial Pipeline. And even months after Colonial Pipeline, ransomware continues to regularly subvert and cripple enterprises in the US and Europe. Are we not learning the right lessons on defense? Or is it not just an infosec problem, but also an international security issue, with cybercrime being actively wielded â yet again â as a political weapon?

### Time Turner - Hacking RF Attendance Systems (To Be in Two Places at Once)

20 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Vivek Nair Ph.D. Student, EECS department, UC Berkeley

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

It's a tale as old as time: a graduating senior needs two more courses to graduate, but the lectures happen to be scheduled at the same time and the school's new high-tech wireless attendance tracking system makes it impossible to attend both courses... in theory. By reverse-engineering the attendance devices and emulating them using a hidden Arduino, the system can be tricked into giving attendance credit for both courses without being physically present. It's a real-life "time turner," allowing him to be in two places at once.

In 1998 the US government issued the first major policy document on Critical Infrastructure Protection (CIP). Since then, CIP has become one of the most fundamental tasks for governments everywhere, and has given birth to a plethora of institutions and processes seeking to manage what is called a âPublic Private Partnershipâ between government, industry, and civil society. But despite all the efforts put into information exchanges, incident management, but also supply chain protection and even national industrial policies, cyber-attacks have not decreased, both in the United States and elsewhere. What else needs to be done? What lessons learned are there from international experiences? And how can the community help best?

### Gone Apple Pickin': Red Teaming macOS Environments in 2021

45 minutes | Demo

#### Cedric Owens Offensive Security Engineer

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Though the vast majority of US companies are enterprise Windows shops, there is a growing percentage of companies that are shifting away from this model. Most of these types of companies tend to be based in the SF Bay Area and are often tech companies. This talk will provide a glimpse into what common attack paths in these environments look like in the absence of typical enterprise Active Directory implementations. Examples include techniques for targeting macOS endpoints, cloud and IdaaS, CI/CD pipeline, and other fun approaches. I will begin by discussing common tech stacks and macOS deployments and then move into macOS initial access (including the Gatekeeper bypass I found) and post exploitation options in these modern tech environments as well as detection opportunities.

**Cedric Owens**
 Cedric is currently an offensive security engineer who came from a blue team background.

### Warping Reality - creating and countering the next generation of Linux rootkits using eBPF

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### PatH Security Researcher

Virtual only presentation

With complete access to a system, Linux kernel rootkits are perfectly placed to hide malicious access and activity. However, running code in the kernel comes with the massive risk that any change to a kernel version or configuration can mean the difference between running successfully and crashing the entire system. This talk will cover how to use extended Berkley Packet Filters (eBPF) to create kernel rootkits that are safe, stable, stealthy, and portable.

eBPF is one of the newest additions to the Linux kernel, designed to easily load safe, constrained, and portable programs into the kernel to observe and make decisions about network traffic, syscalls, and more. But thatâs not itâs only use: by creating eBPF programs that target specific processes we can warp reality, presenting a version of a file to one program and a different version to another, all without altering the real file on disk. This enables techniques such as presenting a backdoor user to ssh while hiding from sysadmins, or smuggling data inside connections from legitimate programs. This talk will also cover how to use these same techniques in malware analysis to fool anti-sanbox checks.

These ideas and more are explored in this talk alongside practical methods to detect and prevent this next generation of Linux rootkits.

### Hi! I'm DOMAIN\Steve, please let me access VLAN2

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Justin Perdok Security Specialist, Orange Cyberdefense Netherlands

Virtual only presentation

By responding to probing requests made by Palo Alto and SonicWALL firewalls, it's possible to apply security policies to arbitrary IPs on the network, allowing access to segmented resources.

Segmentation using firewalls is a critical security component for an organization. To scale, many firewall vendors have features that make rule implementation simpler, such as basing effective access on a user identity or workstation posture. Security products that probe client computers often have their credentials abused by either cracking a password hash, or by relaying an authentication attempt elsewhere. Prior work by Esteban Rodriguez and by Xavier Mertens cover this. In this talk I will show a new practical attack on identity-based firewalls to coerce them into applying chosen security policies to arbitrary IPs on a network by spoofing logged in users instead of cracking passwords.

Logged on user information is often gathered using the WKST (Workstation Service Remote Protocol) named pipe. By extending Impacket with the ability to respond to these requests, logged on users on a device can be spoofed, and arbitrary firewall rules applied.

We will dive into the details of how client probing has historically been a feature that should be avoided while introducing a new practical attack to emphasize that fact.

### You're Doing IoT RNG

45 minutes | Demo

#### Dan "AltF4" Petro Lead Researcher, Bishop Fox

#### Allan Cecil (dwangoAC)Security Consultant, Bishop Fox

Virtual only presentation

Think of a random number between '0' and infinity. Was your number '0'? Seriously? Crap. Well unfortunately, the hardware random number generators (RNG) used by your favorite IoT devices to create encryption keys may not work much better than you when it comes to randomness.
In this talk, we'll delve into murky design specs, opaque software libraries, and lots of empirical results. We wrote code for many popular IoT SoC platforms to extract gigabytes of data from their hardware RNGs and analyze them. What we found was a systemic minefield of vulnerabilities in almost every platform that could undermine IoT security. Something needs to change in how the Internet of Things does RNG.
The vulnerabilities are widespread and the attacks are practical. RNG is bad out there - "IoT Crypto-pocalypse" bad.

### Hacking the Apple AirTags

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Thomas Roth Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Appleâs AirTags enable tracking of personal belongings. They are the most recent
and cheapest device interacting with the Apple ecosystem. In contrast to other
tracking devices, they feature Ultrawide-band precise positioning and leverage
almost every other Apple device within the Find My localization network.

Less than 10 days after the AirTag release, we bypassed firmware protections by
glitching the nRF52 microcontroller. This opens the AirTags for firmware
analysis and modification. In this talk, we will explain the initial nRF52
bypass as well as various hacks built on top of this. In particular, AirTags can
now act as phishing device by providing malicious links via the NFC interface,
be cloned and appear at a completely different location, used without privacy
protections that should alert users as tracking protection, act as low-quality
microphone by reutilizing the accelerometer, and send arbitrary data via the
Find My network. Besides these malicious use cases, AirTags are now a research
platform that even allows access to the new Ultrawide-band chip U1.

### MAVSH> Attacking from Above

45 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Sach Hacker

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Over the course of 2020 and 2021, drone enthusiasts and the FAA have been locked in a series of legal battles over the future of unmanned aviation.

New regulations and restrictions, such as Remote Identification, aim to leave drone and model aviation hobbyists with a grim choice: incur countless financial costs, or lose the ability to fly freely.

Not only do these regulations impact hobbyists, they also restrict our ability to use drones as recon and payload delivery tools, but the FAA gave us a loophole.

In this talk, I'll share my knowledge of the MAVLink protocol and how it can be modified to take advantage of that loophole. I'll also show you how to build a drone capable of 20+ minute flights, potentially multiple miles of range, and hosting a Raspberry Pi 0 W onboard, enabling remote command execution without the use of onboard WiFi or cellular networks ALL while exploiting that loophole.

Come learn how and why the FAA "Can't Stop the Signal"!

### Adventures in MitM-land: Using Machine-in-the-Middle to Attack Active Directory Authentication Schemes

45 minutes | Demo

#### Sagi Sheinfeld Sr. Engineer, CrowdStrike

#### Eyal Karni Sr. Engineer, CrowdStrike

#### Yaron Zinar Sr. Manager, Engineering, CrowdStrike

Virtual only presentation

Over the years, researchers were able to break many secure protocols using MitM attacks. A common theme in this family of vulnerabilities is the lack of proper validation for any of the communicating parties. We will review previous MitM attacks found on AD authentication protocols and the mitigation strategies previously implemented. We will show that the relay attack technique is not limited to NTLM alone and can be used to attack the newer Kerberos authentication protocol. In addition, we will show several injection attacks compromising client systems. Weâll show how the lack of validation can lead to devastating issues ranging from authentication bypass to remote code execution on various critical infrastructure systems. However, the issues do not stop on Windows on-premises networks but span to other infrastructure such as domain-joined unix machines, virtualization infrastructure, open-source security audit tools and even cloud directories. The talk will deep-dive into multiple vulnerabilities we have discovered along with several demos. Demos include a MitM attack which allows an attacker to inject user passwords in a hybrid AD environment allowing the attacker to authenticate as any user in the network. We will also show how to use a similar technique to compromise many other IT infrastructure.

### Your House is My House: Use of Offensive Enclaves In Adversarial Operations

20 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Dimitry "Op\_Nomad" SnezhkovAssociate Director, Protiviti

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

As developers start to rely more on hardware-based memory encryption controls that isolate specific application code and data in memory - secure enclaves, adversaries can use enclaves to successfully coexist on the host and enjoy similar protections.

In this talk we venture into a practical implementation of such an offensive enclave, with the help of Intel SGX enclave technology, supported on a wide variety of processors present in enterprise data-centers and in the cloud.

We discuss how malware can avoid detection in defensively instrumented environments and protect their operational components from processes running at high privilege levels, including the Operating System. We dive deeper into using enclaves in implants and stagers, and discuss the design and implementation of an enclave that is capable of facilitating secure communication and storage of sensitive data in offensive operations. We cover how the enclaves can be built to help secure external communication while resisting system and network inspection efforts and to achieve deployment with minimal dependencies where possible.

Finally, we release the enclave code and a library of offensive enclave primitives as a useful reference for teams that leverage Intel SGX technology or have the hardware platform capable to support such adversarial efforts.

### Racketeer Toolkit. Prototyping Controlled Ransomware Operations

20 minutes | Demo, Tool

#### Dimitry "Op\_Nomad" SnezhkovAssociate Director, Protiviti

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Offensive testing in organizations has shown a tremendous value for simulating controlled attacks.
While cyber extortion may be one of the main high ROI end goals for the attacker, surprisingly few tools exist to simulate ransomware operations.

Racketeer is one such tool. It is an offensive agent coupled with a C2 base, built to help teams to prototype and exercise a tightly controlled ransomware campaign.

We walk through the design considerations and implementation of a ransomware implant which emulates logical steps taken to manage connectivity and asset encryption and decryption capabilities. We showcase flexible and actionable ways to prototype components of fully remote ransomware operation including key and data management, as well as data communication that is used in ransomware campaigns.

Racketeer is equipped with practical safeguards for lights out operations, and can address the goals of keeping strict control of data and key management in its deployment, including target containment policy, safe credential management, and implementing operational security in simulated operations.

Racketeer can help gain better optics into IoCs, and is helpful in providing detailed logs that can be used to study the behavior and execution artifacts of a ransomware agent.

### SPARROW: A Novel Covert Communication Scheme Exploiting Broadcast Signals in LTE, 5G & Beyond

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Reza Soosahabi Senior R&D Engineer, Keysight Technologies

#### Chuck McAuley Principal security researcher (ATIRC), at Keysight Technologies

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

When researching methods for covert communications in the wireless space, we noticed most hackers are barely looking below the IP layer, and even the wireless guys are focused on creating their own radio (PHY layer) solutions rather than looking at whatâs already available to them. We discovered a sweet spot that takes advantage of MAC layer protocols in LTE and 5G, enabling long range communication using other peopleâs networks, GSMA CVD-2021-0045. We can use SPARROW devices almost everywhere in a variety of scenarios, such as data exfiltration and command and control. Despite limited data rates, the new scheme can defeat known covert communication schemes with dedicated PHY in the following ways:

- Maximum Anonymity: SPARROW devices do not authenticate with the host network while operating. This eliminates their exposure to network security and lawful intercept systems as well as spectrum scanners. Utilizing limited resources, they cause very minimal impact on the host network services.

- More Miles per Watt: SPARROW devices can be several miles apart exploiting broadcast power of base stations or non-terrestrial technologies. The range can be further extended by deploying several of them in a geographically sparse mesh network.

- Low Power & Low Complexity: SPARROW devices can utilize existing protocol implementation libraries installed on commodity SDRs. They can operate on batteries or harvest energy from the environment for long durations, just like real sparrows!

### Extension-Land: exploits and rootkits in your browser extensions

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Barak Sternberg Senior Security Researcher

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

Browser extensions are installed anywhere, they serve as an integral part of our day-to-day web routine, from AdBlockers to Auto-Translators.
But - do we know what is running inside of them? Do we know what goes deep-down inside their communication routines?
How do they use their internal APIâs? And how do their different JS execution contexts work?

In this session, I will explore these unique internal extension APIâs, hidden attack-surfaces and show how these concepts can be broken & exploited using new ways!
I start showing how an attacker can "jump" from one low-permissions chrome-app/extension to another, hence elevating its permissions.
Then, I will show how to gain full "browser-persistency" inside extensions' background-scripts context.

Chaining it all together, I show how attacker, starting from low permissions chrome-app, gains a fully-armed "extension-rootkit",
a persistent JS-malware running inside of a âgoodâ extension, along with C&C features, JS injection techniques to any tab/origin, obfuscation-techniques and more.
Eventually, I will present a generic technique, targeting all chrome-users, for taking over any previously installed chrome extension and implant an "extension-rootkit" in it.

### A new class of DNS vulnerabilities affecting many DNS-as-Service platforms

20 minutes | Demo

#### Shir Tamari Head of Research, Wiz (Wiz.io)

#### Ami Luttwak CTO, Wiz

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

We present a novel class of DNS vulnerabilities that affects multiple DNS-as-a-Service (DNSaaS) providers. The vulnerabilities have been proven and successfully exploited on three major cloud providers including AWS Route 53 and may affect many others. Successful exploitation of the vulnerabilities may allow exfiltration of sensitive information from service customers' corporate networks. The leaked information contains internal and external IP addresses, computer names, and sometimes NTLM hashes. The number of organizations vulnerable to this weakness is shocking. Over a few hours of DNS sniffing, we received sensitive information carried by DNS update queries from ~1M Windows endpoints from around 15,000 potentially vulnerable companies, including 15 Fortune 500 companies. In some organizations, there were more than 20,000 endpoints that actively leaked their information out of the organization. We will review possible mitigations to this problem and solutions for both DNSaaS providers and managed networks.

### UFOs: Misinformation, Disinformation, and the Basic Truth

45 minutes

#### Richard Thieme AKA neuralcowboy author and professional speaker, ThiemeWorks

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

The talk, "UFOs and Government: A Historical Inquiry" given at Def Con 21 has been viewed thousands of times. It was a serious well-documented exploration of the UFO subject based on Thieme's participation in research into the subject with colleagues. The book of that name is the gold standard for historical research into the subject and is in 100+ university libraries.

This update was necessitated by recent UFO incidents and the diverse conversations triggered by them. Contextual understanding is needed to evaluate current reports from pilots and naval personnel, statements from senators and Pentagon personnel, and indeed, all the input from journalists who are often unfamiliar with the field and the real history of documented UFOs over the past 70 years.

Thieme was privileged to participate with scholars and lifelong researchers into the massive trove of reports. We estimate that 95% can be explained by mundane phenomena but the remainder suggest prolonged interaction with our planetary society over a long period. Thieme also knows that when you know you don't know something, don't suggest that you do. Stay with the facts, stay with the data. Sensible conclusions, when we do that, are astonishing enough.

Reality, as Philip K. Dick said, will not go away just because we refuse to believe in it.

### ProxyLogon is Just the Tip of the Iceberg, A New Attack Surface on Microsoft Exchange Server!

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Orange Tsai Principal Security Researcher of DEVCORE

Virtual only presentation

Microsoft Exchange Server is an email solution widely deployed within government and enterprises, and it is an integral part of both their daily operations and security. Needless to say, vulnerabilities in Exchange have long been the Holy Grail for attackers, hence our security research on Exchange. Surprisingly, weâve found not only critical vulnerabilities such as ProxyLogon, but a whole new attack surface of Exchange.

This new attack surface is based on a significant change in Exchange Server 2013, where the fundamental protocol handler, Client Access Service (CAS), splits into frontend and backend. In this fundamental change of architecture, quite an amount of design debt was incurred, and, even worse, it introduced inconsistencies between contexts, leading us to discover this new attack surface.

To unveil the beauty of this attack surface and our novel exploitation, weâll start by analyzing this architecture, followed by 7 vulnerabilities that consist of server-side bugs, client-side bugs, and crypto bugs found via this attack surface. In the end, these vulnerabilities are chained into 3 attack vectors that shine in different attack scenarios: ProxyLogon, ProxyShell, and ProxyOracle. These attack vectors enable any unauthenticated attacker to uncover plaintext passwords and even execute arbitrary code on Microsoft Exchange Servers through port 443, which is exposed to the Internet by ~400K Exchange Servers.

This attack surface has its unparalleled impact for a reason: security researchers tend to find vulnerabilities from a certain perspective, such as digging for memory bugs, injections, or logic flaws, but we took a different approach by looking at Exchange from a high-level architectural view and captured this architecture-level attack surface, which yielded multiple vulnerabilities. We hope this brings a new paradigm to vulnerability research and inspires more security researchers to look into Exchange Server. Last but not least, weâll provide hardening actions to mitigate such types of 0days in Exchange.

### Sneak into buildings with KNXnet/IP

45 minutes | Demo

#### Claire Vacherot Senior Security Auditor @ Orange Cyberdefense

Virtual only presentation

Building Management Systems control a myriad of devices such as lighting, shutters and HVAC. KNX (and by extension KNXnet/IP) is a common protocol used to interact with these BMS. However, the public's understanding and awareness is lacking, and effective tooling is scarce all while the BMS device market keeps on growing.

The ability to craft arbitrary KNXnet/IP frames to interact with these often-insecure BMS provides an excellent opportunity in uncovering vulnerabilities in both the implementation of KNX as well as the protocol itself. From unpacking KNX at a lower level, to using a Python-based protocol crafting framework we developed to interact with KNXnet/IP implementations, in this talk weâll go on a journey of discovering how BMS that implement KNXnet/IP work as well as how to interact with and fuzz them.

After this talk you could also claim that âthe pool on the roof has a leakâ!

### Timeless Timing Attacks

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Tom Van Goethem Researcher, KU Leuven

#### Mathy Vanhoef Postdoctoral Researcher, NYU

Virtual only presentation

25 years ago, the first timing attacks against well-known cryptosystems such as RSA and Diffie-Hellman were introduced. By carefully measuring the execution time of crypto operations, an attacker could infer the bits of the secret. Ever since, timing attacks have frequently resurfaced, leading to many vulnerabilities in various applications and cryptosystems that do not have constant-time execution. As networks became more stable and low-latency, it soon became possible to perform these timing attacks over an Internet connection, potentially putting millions of devices at risk. However, attackers still face the challenge of overcoming the jitter that is incurred on the network path, as it obfuscates the real timing values. Up until now, an adversary would have to collect thousands or millions of measurements to infer a single bit of information.

In this presentation, we introduce a conceptually novel way of performing timing attacks that is completely resilient to network jitter. This means that remote timing attacks can now be executed with a performance and accuracy that is similar as if the attack was performed on the local system. With this technique, which leverages coalescing of network packets and request multiplexing, it is possible to detect timing differences as small as 100ns over any Internet connection. We will elaborate on how this technique can be launched against HTTP/2 webservers, Tor onion services, and EAP-pwd, a popular Wi-Fi authentication method.

### Central bank digital currency, threats and vulnerabilities

45 minutes | Exploit

#### Ian Vitek Security, Sveriges Riksbank (Central bank of Sweden)

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

What are the threats and vulnerabilities of a retail central bank digital currency (CBDC)? The central bank of Sweden has built a prototype of a retail CBDC system and I will run through the procurement requirements and design and point out where a two-tier CBDC need protection against attacks. The prototype is built on Corda Token SDK and I have during tests found reliable ways to exploit weaknesses in the design. The presentation will focus on the vulnerabilities that can crash the service that handles the tokens and permanently lock tokens rendering tokens and digital wallets useless. The presentation will also go into detail how tokens are validated and how information from all earlier transactions is needed for this. With D3.js and HTML5 I will visualize the token history (backchain) and describe how this can be a problem with GDPR and the Swedish bank secrecy regulation.

The presentation will end with a summary of identified threats and weaknesses of a two-tier retail central bank digital currency prototype and how to handle them.
The goal of the presentation is to give the attendees insight of the security implications, challenges depending on the design and where an attack can be carried out and everything that cannot be missed when designing a CBDC.

### Breaking Secure Bootloaders

45 minutes | Demo, Tool, Exploit

#### Christopher Wade Security Consultant at Pen Test Partners

Virtual only presentation

Bootloaders often use signature verification mechanisms in order to protect a device from executing malicious software. This talk aims to outline actionable weaknesses in modern bootloaders which allow attackers to deploy unsigned code, despite these protection mechanisms.

In the first phase of this talk, we will discuss exploitation of the bootloaders in modern Android smartphones, demonstrating weaknesses which allow for bypassing bootloader unlocking restrictions, decryption of protected user data, and deployment of malicious software to devices using full disk encryption.

In the second phase, we will discuss bootloader weaknesses in the secondary hardware used by smartphones. Using an embedded RF chip as a target, we will demonstrate reverse engineering techniques which identified weaknesses in the signature verification mechanisms of the firmware update protocols used by the bootloader, allowing for deployment of custom firmware to the chip.

### Defending against nation-state (legal) attack: how to build a privacy-protecting service in the era of ubiquitous surveillance

45 minutes

#### Bill "Woody" Woodcock Chair of the Foundation Council, Quad9

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

US diplomacy and the US District Court of Northern California provide a nearly impenetrable shield against legal assault from other countries for the many tech companies that choose the San Francisco Bay Area as their legal domicile. But US domicile has left companies undefended against ECPA, CALEA, Patriot Act and FISA requests and the gag orders which prevent their disclosure, and the US has little or no statutory protections for usersâ privacy. So how do you hack the international legal and diplomatic system to defend the privacy of users of Internet services against nation-state legal attacks? The privacy-and-security-oriented non-profit DNS recursive resolver Quad9 spent four years working the system and learning from prior examples like ProtonMail, and Bill Woodcock, the chair of Quad9âs Foundation Council, will talk about the threat model Quad9 is defending against, how legal domicile and physical presence interact, and how Quad9 is building a model that other privacy-respecting services can follow. Heâll discuss the critical differences between jurisdictions and legal regimes that Quad9 uncovered in their four-year selection process, and the key and differentiating protections the Swiss government offers that the US and EU governments do not. And if yâall get tired of that, you might be able to convince him to talk about the injunction Sony Music got against Quad9 in the copyright-troll court in Hamburg and why more privacy may also come at the risk of more censorship.

### How I use a JSON Deserialization 0day to Steal Your Money On The Blockchain

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

#### Hao Xing Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

#### Zekai Wu Security Researcher from Tencent Security Xuanwu Lab

Virtual only presentation

Fastjson is a widely used open source JSON parser with 23'100 stars on GitHub. As a basic module of countless java web services, it serves hundreds of millions of users. We managed to find a way to bypass many security checks and mitigations by using the inheritance process of some basic classes, and achieve remote code execution successfully. We will disclose these high-risk and universal gadgets for the first time in this talk.

Now, we can control many important websites and affect millions of users. Let's make things more interesting. We found that this fastjson vulnerability affect a multi-billion-dollar blockchain. We designed multiple complex gadgets based on the features of the blockchain, and exquisitely achieved information leakage and pointer hijacking. Putting all these gadgets together, we achieved remote code execution on the blockchain nodes.

However, generally after remote code execution, we seem to have no better exploit method other than the 51% attack, which will lead to serious accounting confusion. After a detailed analysis of the architecture design of the public blockchain, we found a way from RCE to steal the public blockchain users' assets almost without any notification.

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first published attack case on the realization of covertly stealing user assets after RCE on the public blockchain nodes. We will propose a more covert post penetration exploit method for public blockchain nodes in this talk.

Blockchain is not bulletproof to security vulnerability. We will show you how to use classical web vulnerabilities attack the blockchain and how to steal real money from the decentralized cyber world.

### Glitching RISC-V chips: MTVEC corruption for hardening ISA

45 minutes | Demo, Exploit

Speaker(s) will be at DEF CON!

RISC-V is an open standard instruction set architecture (ISA) provided under open-source licenses that do not require fees to use. ISA is based on established reduced instruction set computer (RISC) principles. RISC-V has features to increase computer speed, while reducing cost and power use.

Many industry players like Google, IBM, NVIDIA, Qualcomm, and Samsung are members of the RISC-V Foundation and have long supported RISC-V development. In 2016, NVIDIA unveiled plans to replace the internal microcontrollers of their graphic cards with next-gen RISC-V-based controllers built for upcoming NVIDIA GPUs.

NVIDIA's Product Security undertook a detailed architectural analysis and research of the RISC-V IP, discovering a potential risk with the ambiguous specification of the Machine Trap Base Address (MTVEC) register. This ambiguity leads to potential fault injection vulnerabilities under physical attack models.
