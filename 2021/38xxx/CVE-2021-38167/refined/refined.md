The provided content describes multiple vulnerabilities in the `roxy-wi` project, which when combined, can lead to pre-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE).

**Vulnerabilities:**

1.  **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application directly uses user-controlled input from the `uuid` cookie in SQL queries within the `check_login()` function. Specifically, the `sql.update_last_act_user(user_uuid.value)` function does not sanitize the cookie value before including it in the SQL query.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can perform blind SQL injection without authentication, potentially dumping the entire database and/or extract a valid `uuid` to bypass authentication.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Sending a crafted `uuid` cookie value with the request.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker can exploit this without any prior authentication or privileges.

2.  **Authenticated SQL Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** Several functions, particularly `select_servers()`, use unsanitized user-controlled input from various parameters (like `server`, `id`, `hostname`, `id_hostname`, `uuid`) in SQL queries.
    *   **Weakness:** SQL Injection vulnerability due to lack of input sanitization.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker with valid user account (even least privileged such as guest) can exploit SQL injection.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Manipulating HTTP parameters such as `serv`, `service` (as shown in the `hapservers.py` example), to inject SQL code in the `select_servers()` function.
    *   **Required Capabilities:** An attacker needs to have a valid (even least privilege like guest) account to perform the exploit.

3. **Command Injection:**
    *   **Root Cause:** The application uses user-controlled input in commands executed via `subprocess_execute()`. Specifically, the `get_all_stick_table()` function constructs a shell command using values from the settings table, which can be modified by an authenticated user.
    *   **Weakness:** Command injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user-controlled input used in command execution.
    *   **Impact:** An attacker can execute arbitrary system commands on the server.
    *   **Attack Vector:** Modifying the `haproxy_sock_port` setting via the web interface and triggering a call to `get_all_stick_table()` which will execute the crafted command.
    *    **Required Capabilities:**  An attacker needs a valid account to change the settings and trigger the vulnerable command execution.

**Exploitation Chain:**

The vulnerability report describes combining the unauthenticated SQL injection to extract a valid `uuid` and then using the command injection vulnerability (which could be reachable even from a guest account) for RCE.

**Summary of Pre-Auth RCE:**

An unauthenticated attacker could:
1. Exploit the unauthenticated SQL injection to extract a valid user `uuid`.
2. Use the extracted `uuid` to bypass authentication and obtain a valid user session.
3. Log in with the `uuid` and trigger the command injection vulnerability to gain RCE.

**Mitigation:**
The report mentions that most SQL requests have been rewritten using peewee ORM to address SQL injection and checks have been added to command parameters to address command injection vulnerabilities.
