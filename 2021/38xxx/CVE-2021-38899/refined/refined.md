- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the shared nature of "shared credentials" in IBM Cloud Pak for Data, which makes it difficult to track and audit access, identify the source of data loss, and pinpoint the origin of a security breach.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is the lack of sufficient auditing and access control mechanisms for shared credentials. This exposes the system to potential unauthorized access and data breaches.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to unauthorized access to highly sensitive information, data loss, and security breaches. It becomes difficult to trace the source of these incidents due to the shared nature of the credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** A local user with special privileges can gain access to shared credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be a local user with special privileges, allowing them to access the shared credentials.
