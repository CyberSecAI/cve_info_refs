- **Root cause of vulnerability**: A defect in IBM Data Virtualization on Cloud Pak for Data causes Watson Knowledge Catalog data masking rules to not be enforced when a user executes a `CREATE TABLE AS (SELECT …) WITH DATA` statement.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Data masking rules are bypassed, leading to the creation of tables with unmasked sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Exposure of sensitive data that should have been masked.
- **Attack vectors**: Executing a specific SQL command (`CREATE TABLE AS (SELECT …) WITH DATA`) in IBM Data Virtualization on Cloud Pak for Data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: A user with the ability to execute SQL commands in the affected IBM Data Virtualization environment.
