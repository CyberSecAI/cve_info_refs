Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

**Root Cause:**

*   The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of proper neutralization of user-controllable input within the openBaraza HCM HR Payroll v.3.1.6 application. Specifically, the application fails to sanitize or encode user inputs before displaying them on web pages.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a stored XSS vulnerability. This occurs because the application stores user-provided data (e.g., in textboxes) without proper sanitization. When other users visit pages displaying this data, malicious JavaScript embedded by the attacker gets executed in their browser.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Credential Theft:** An attacker could potentially steal user credentials.
*   **Session Hijacking:** An attacker could hijack user sessions.
*   **Malware Delivery:** An attacker could deliver malware to victims.
*  **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker could inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the context of the victim's browser.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Unauthenticated Remote Attack:** The vulnerability can be exploited by an unauthenticated attacker, meaning no prior login or access is required.
*   **Input Injection:** The attacker injects malicious JavaScript into specific input fields on vulnerable pages.
*   **User Interaction:** The malicious code executes when legitimate users visit affected pages that display the attacker's injected content.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker does not need to be authenticated.
*   The attacker needs to identify the vulnerable input fields and inject the malicious payloads.
*   The attacker relies on other users accessing the pages containing the injected code for the attack to be successful.

**Vulnerable Pages and Textboxes:**

*   `/hr/application.jsp`: vulnerable textboxes are `first_name`, `surname`, and `email`.
*   `/hr/subscription.jsp`: vulnerable textboxes are `business_name`, `primary_contact`, `primary_email`, and `confirm_email`.

**Payload Examples:**
*   `<img src='x'onerror="alert('First');" />`
*   `<img src='x'onerror="alert('Surname');" />`
*   `a@a.com<img src='x'onerror="alert('email');" />`
*   `<img src='x'onerror="alert('business');" />`
*   `<img src='x'onerror="alert('contact');" />`
*   `<img src='x'onerror="alert('email');" />`

**Affected Pages:**

*   `/hr/index.jsp?view=23:0` (affected by application.jsp)
*   `/hr/index.jsp?view=94:0` (affected by subscription.jsp)

**Additional Notes:**
* The github content provides more detail than a basic CVE description typically would, with specific vulnerable pages, input fields, and example payloads.
* The openbaraza.org content does not contain information about the CVE but is related to the product affected.
