Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the `ammonia` crate not properly handling namespace differences between HTML, SVG, and MathML during parsing. Even when `svg` and `math` elements are disallowed, the underlying HTML parser treats them differently. This leads to an "impossible" DOM state after cleanup.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Mutation XSS:** The core vulnerability is a mutation XSS.  The crafted DOM appears safe when examined, but when serialized and deserialized, it can be exploited to inject arbitrary HTML markup. This is due to the discrepancy between how the DOM is perceived and how it's ultimately rendered.
*   **Incorrect Namespace Handling:** The root cause is the failure to account for namespace-related parsing differences. The parser's behavior within different namespaces for HTML, SVG, and MathML is not correctly handled during the sanitization process.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary HTML Injection:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML markup into the application's output. This can have various consequences, including:
    *   Executing malicious scripts (JavaScript) in the user's browser.
    *   Stealing cookies or session tokens.
    *   Defacing the application's UI.
    *   Redirecting users to malicious websites.
    *   Potentially performing other actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Embedded SVG/MathML:**  The attacker leverages the mishandling of embedded SVG or MathML content within specific HTML elements. 
*  **Raw Text Elements:** Exploitation requires the application to permit at least one of the elements that are parsed as raw text in HTML. These include `title`, `textarea`, `xmp`, `iframe`, `noembed`, `noframes`, `plaintext`, `noscript`, `style`, and `script`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to inject HTML:** The attacker needs to be able to inject HTML, or some form of user-supplied content that will then be sanitized by the vulnerable `ammonia` library.
*  **Target Application allows Raw Text Elements**: The application using the `ammonia` library must explicitly allow at least one of the listed raw text elements for the vulnerability to be exploited. This is a necessary condition for the vulnerability to be triggered.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability was fixed in versions `>=3.1.0` and `>=2.1.3, <3.0.0` of the `ammonia` crate.
*   Applications not explicitly allowing the listed raw text elements are not vulnerable as none of those are allowed by default.
