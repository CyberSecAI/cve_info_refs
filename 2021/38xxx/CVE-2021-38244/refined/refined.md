Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from the use of user-controlled input (`heat_map`, `gene`, and `alteration` parameters) to construct regular expressions without proper sanitization. Specifically, the `alteration` parameter is used directly within a regular expression matching operation.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Regex Injection:** User-supplied input is directly incorporated into a regex pattern, allowing for manipulation of the regex execution.
*   **ReDoS (Regular Expression Denial of Service):** By crafting a malicious `alteration` string, an attacker can cause the regular expression engine to enter a state of catastrophic backtracking, leading to excessive CPU consumption and a potential denial-of-service condition.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service (DoS):** A specially crafted request can cause the server to consume 100% CPU, potentially leading to a denial of service. Multiple such requests could overwhelm the server and render it unavailable.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Request Parameter Manipulation:** The attacker exploits the vulnerability by sending a malicious string through the `alteration` HTTP request parameter to the `/ProteinArraySignificanceTest.json` endpoint. The `heat_map` and `gene` parameters are also mentioned as user-controlled input, but the vulnerability lies with `alteration`.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint of the cBioPortal application.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerable Parameters:** The attacker needs to know the names of the request parameters (`heat_map`, `gene`, and especially `alteration`) that influence the vulnerable regex matching process.
*   **Understanding of ReDoS:** An attacker needs to be able to craft an input string that will result in a catastrophic backtracking scenario for the regex engine used by the application.

**Additional Notes:**

* The issue was initially closed without a code fix, but after the reporter demonstrated a proof of concept the vulnerable endpoint was removed.
* The fix was to delete the vulnerable servlet and also update the `web.xml` to remove the servlet beans.
