| I have tried to contact you by cbioportal@cbio.mskcc.org and asked for any other email in [#8658](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/issues/8658). Nobody replied.  The cBioPortal is vulnerable to regex injection that may lead to Denial of Service.  User controlled `heatmap` and `alteration` are used to build and run a regex expression:   [cbioportal/core/src/main/java/org/mskcc/cbio/portal/servlet/ProteinArraySignificanceTestJSON.java](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/blob/e086d40f17ac037161677d5478a5dc5ec710bbd8/core/src/main/java/org/mskcc/cbio/portal/servlet/ProteinArraySignificanceTestJSON.java#L104-L106)  Lines 104 to 106 in [e086d40](/cBioPortal/cbioportal/commit/e086d40f17ac037161677d5478a5dc5ec710bbd8)   |  | String heatMap = request.getParameter("heat\_map"); | | --- | --- | |  | String gene = request.getParameter("gene"); | |  | String alterationType = request.getParameter("alteration"); |     The value end up in getAlteredCases   [cbioportal/core/src/main/java/org/mskcc/cbio/portal/servlet/ProteinArraySignificanceTestJSON.java](https://github.com/cBioPortal/cbioportal/blob/e086d40f17ac037161677d5478a5dc5ec710bbd8/core/src/main/java/org/mskcc/cbio/portal/servlet/ProteinArraySignificanceTestJSON.java#L279-L282)  Lines 279 to 282 in [e086d40](/cBioPortal/cbioportal/commit/e086d40f17ac037161677d5478a5dc5ec710bbd8)   |  | if (parts[1].equals(alterationType) | | --- | --- | |  | || parts[1].matches("^"+alterationType+"[;\\t]") | |  | || parts[1].matches(".+[;\\t]"+alterationType+"[;\\t]") | |  | || parts[1].matches(".+[;\\t]"+alterationType+"$")) { |      Since the attacker controls the string and the regex pattern he may cause a ReDoS by regex catastrophic backtracking on the server side. |

| Oh, did you just close the issue without fixing the code? Even if the parameters are not used the code is still callable. Do I miss something? |

### **[ghost](/ghost)** commented [Jul 13, 2021](#issuecomment-879276987)

| I thought since the issue was so brutally closed without explanation maybe my code analysis is wrong and it is not expoitable. Thus I have followed the instructions from <https://docs.cbioportal.org/2.1.1-deploy-with-docker-recommended/docker> and ran a local instance of cbioportal in container. I have a proof of concept when just a single request makes server cpu to consume 100% indefinetely. Please create a [security advisory](https://docs.github.com/en/code-security/security-advisories/creating-a-security-advisory) where you could invite me and discuss it in private if you have any questions.  It makes me sad that such a noble project makes it hard to responsibly disclose a security issue that may potentially lead to Denial of Service. Please respond in 24 hours. |

| [@edvraa](https://github.com/edvraa) Thanks for reporting this. The code is not being used in production anymore. Also, we planned to retire both core and portal modules once all dependencies are removed ([cBioPortal/icebox#161](https://github.com/cBioPortal/icebox/issues/161)), so at this moment, we will not invest time fixing issues in these two modules that will not be running in production. |

| [@jjgao](https://github.com/jjgao) The question is not if it is used or not. Single request to `http://cbioportal.org/ProteinArraySignificanceTest.json?heat_map=censored&gene=censored&alteration=censored` will make the web server consume 100% CPU. Multiple requests like this may potentially take down the server. Since it is not used, commenting out the function or disabling the route sounds as easy fix, right? |

If this servlet is being removed, I think we also need to drop the servlet beans from portal/src/main/webapp/WEB-INF/web.xml (lines 341 - 348). Otherwise I expect we would see a BeanNotFound Exception during startup ... or maybe when the servlet is first accessed.

From the issue comments it seems like there is already approval to drop this service from the core. If that is so, this is a first step towards our larger cleanup (jettisoning the core).

Sorry, something went wrong.

| If I may suggest. Keep the class. Make `processRequest` return empty result early if it is really not used. That would be the quickest less intrusive security fix without making too much refactoring. |

| [@adamabeshouse](https://github.com/adamabeshouse) Why not just include the update to web.xml as Rob suggests? Seems like an easy update to the PR. |
