# Potential consensus divergence from Ed25519 edge cases

Ed25519 poses risks in consensus-critical applications, because (a) the spec does not require that implementations agree on whether signatures are valid and (b) in practice, implementations differ from the spec and from each other.

In the context of working to address this issue in Zcash (resulting in [ZIP215](https://zips.z.cash/zip-0215)), I created a set of 196 test vectors, consisting of hex-encoded (public key, signature) pairs on the message `b"Zcash"`. Running these test vectors across various other Ed25519 implementations reveals a wide divergence in behaviour (see [1](https://github.com/informalsystems/tendermint-rs/issues/355) [2](https://github.com/golang/go/issues/40478#issuecomment-666043072) for additional context).

From a quick look at the Tor source and some tips from Teor, it looks like Tor has four different verification codepaths: ref10 `open`, ref10 `open_batch`, donna `open`, and donna `open_batch`. But I'm not entirely sure whether these are all used, because that requires a deeper knowledge of the codebase than I have.

The test vectors can be found in C-friendly format (thanks to Patrick Steuer) here: <https://github.com/p-steuer/ossl-eddsa-tests>

# New Stable Releases: Tor 0.3.5.16, 0.4.5.10 and 0.4.6.7

by dgoulet | August 16, 2021

![](lead.png)

Greetings!

We have a new stable release today. If you build Tor from source, you can download the source code for the latest stable release on the [download page](https://www.torproject.org/download/tor/). Packages should be available within the next several weeks, with a new Tor Browser later this week.

The ChangeLog for 0.4.6.7 follows below. For the changelogs for other releases, see the [announcement email](https://lists.torproject.org/pipermail/tor-announce/2021-August/000228.html). These releases backport stability fixes from later Tor releases, and a security issue classified as HIGH per our [policy.](https://gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/core/team/-/wikis/NetworkTeam/SecurityPolicy)

Tor 0.4.6.7 fixes several bugs from earlier versions of Tor, including one that could lead to a denial-of-service attack. Everyone running an earlier version, whether as a client, a relay, or an onion service, should upgrade to Tor 0.3.5.16, 0.4.5.10, or 0.4.6.7.

## Changes in version 0.4.6.7 - 2021-08-16

* Major bugfixes (cryptography, security):
  + Resolve an assertion failure caused by a behavior mismatch between our batch-signature verification code and our single-signature verification code. This assertion failure could be triggered remotely, leading to a denial of service attack. We fix this issue by disabling batch verification. Fixes bug [40078](https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/40078); bugfix on 0.2.6.1-alpha. This issue is also tracked as TROVE-2021-007 and CVE-2021-38385. Found by Henry de Valence.
* Minor feature (fallbackdir):
  + Regenerate fallback directories list. Close ticket [40447](https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/40447).Â

* Minor features (geoip data):
  + Update the geoip files to match the IPFire Location Database, as retrieved on 2021/08/12.
* Minor bugfix (crypto):
  + Disable the unused batch verification feature of ed25519-donna. Fixes bug [40078](https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/40078); bugfix on 0.2.6.1-alpha. Found by Henry de Valence.
* Minor bugfixes (onion service):
  + Send back the extended SOCKS error 0xF6 (Onion Service Invalid Address) for a v2 onion address. Fixes bug [40421](https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/40421); bugfix on 0.4.6.2-alpha.
* Minor bugfixes (relay):
  + Reduce the compression level for data streaming from HIGH to LOW in order to reduce CPU load on the directory relays. Fixes bug [40301](https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/40301); bugfix on 0.3.5.1-alpha.
* Minor bugfixes (timekeeping):
  + Calculate the time of day correctly on systems where the time\_t type includes leap seconds. (This is not the case on most operating systems, but on those where it occurs, our tor\_timegm function did not correctly invert the system's gmtime function, which could result in assertion failures when calculating voting schedules.) Fixes bug [40383](https://bugs.torproject.org/tpo/core/tor/40383); bugfix on 0.2.0.3-alpha.

### [I hope this time around theâ¦](#comment-292617)

I hope this time around the deb.torproject.org actually upgrades to 0.4.6.7 for all (the last few releases of 0.4.6.\* have not been updated other than as experimental despite them being stable!).

As was noted on gitlab.torproject.org/tpo/tpa/team/-/issues/40221#note\_2745110 the newer versions were held off due to Debian 11 Bullseye freeze, but now that it has been released that should not be any blocking issue for upgrading to 0.4.6.

ed\_pubkey is optional if no node information.

ed\_pubkey is not optional for channel reuse.
