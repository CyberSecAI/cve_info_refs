- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A vulnerability exists in IBM Spectrum Scale FAL (Filesystem Audit Logging) that allows a privileged admin to destroy filesystem audit logging records.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Insecure handling of audit logging records that allows deletion of records before their expiration time.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A privileged admin can destroy filesystem audit logging records before their intended expiration, potentially hindering security investigations or compliance efforts by removing audit trails.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires a privileged admin with access to the IBM Spectrum Scale FAL.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Attacker must have privileged admin access to IBM Spectrum Scale.
