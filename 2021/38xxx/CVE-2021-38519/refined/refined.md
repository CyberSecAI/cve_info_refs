The provided content is related to a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, which is not described in the CVE-2021-38519. Therefore, the content is related to a different vulnerability than the CVE.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The primary weakness is the presence of a command injection vulnerability. This means an attacker with valid administrative credentials can execute arbitrary commands on the underlying operating system of the affected router.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the device. This can lead to a variety of consequences, including complete control over the device, data exfiltration, denial of service, and the ability to use the device as part of a botnet.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector involves exploiting a command injection vulnerability that requires prior authentication.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to have valid administrative credentials to exploit this vulnerability. This requires either a compromised account or a successful brute-force attack.
