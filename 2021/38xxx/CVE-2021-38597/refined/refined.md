Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38597:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from improper handling of the `ocspNoCheck` extension in the wolfSSL library. Specifically, the code was not consistently applying the `NO_VERIFY` flag when this extension was present in an OCSP response, which dictates that the responder's certificate should be trusted for its lifetime.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Verification Logic:** The code had inconsistent logic for handling the `ocspNoCheck` extension. There was a case where if `verify` is set to `VERIFY_OCSP_CERT` (Verify OCSP Certificate), it would still check the certificate validity if the `ocspNoCheckSet` is not set and fall back to `VERIFY_OCSP` . This bypasses the intention of the extension, which is to trust the responder's certificate if the `ocspNoCheck` extension is present. The fix adds a conditional check to the if statement when `verify` is set to `VERIFY_OCSP_CERT`, such that if `ocspNoCheckSet` is set, `verify` will be `VERIFY` which means skip verification.
- **Missing enforcement of no verification:** Specifically in `DecodeBasicOcspResponse`, the `ParseCertRelative` was using `VERIFY_OCSP` instead of `VERIFY_OCSP_CERT` when noVerify is set to false and the intended logic was to use `VERIFY_OCSP_CERT` which checks both OCSP and certificate validity.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Bypassed Certificate Verification:** An attacker could potentially craft a malicious OCSP response with the `ocspNoCheck` extension. This could lead to the acceptance of invalid responder certificates, potentially allowing for a man-in-the-middle (MITM) attack or other malicious activities.
- **Incorrect trust of responder certificate:** By incorrectly applying certificate verification logic, the responder certificate may be trusted even if it is not actually valid.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MITM):** An attacker positioned in the network path could intercept OCSP requests and provide crafted responses.
- **Compromised OCSP Responder:** An attacker could compromise a legitimate OCSP responder and inject a malicious `ocspNoCheck` extension into a response.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to intercept or manipulate network traffic between a client and an OCSP responder.
- **OCSP Response Forgery:** The attacker must be capable of crafting or manipulating OCSP responses to include the `ocspNoCheck` extension.
