- **Root cause of vulnerability:** User credentials may be displayed in plain text in the trace file if tracing is enabled in Operations Center.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Information disclosure due to logging sensitive data (user credentials) in plain text.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exposure of user credentials which could lead to unauthorized access or further malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors:** Exploitation requires access to the system's trace files. An attacker who gains access to these trace files can potentially view user credentials.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** Requires access to the server's file system where the trace files are stored. This could be achieved through gaining access to the server, an insider threat or by compromising other related systems.
