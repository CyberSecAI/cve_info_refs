{
  "CVE-2021-38378": {
    "Root cause": "A caching mechanism for files in OX Drive did not consider the context identifier of a specific object.",
    "Weaknesses": [
      "Information Disclosure (CWE-200)"
    ],
    "Impact": "Unauthorized users may gain access to confidential information, such as other users' names, by observing the \"modified by\" response of the API for files that would collide with other users' files that bear the same identifier. This is limited to user names, with no evidence of file content exposure.",
    "Attack vectors": "Network access to the OX Drive API.",
    "Required attacker capabilities": "An attacker needs to have an account on the affected system and needs to observe the “modified by” information on files where the identifiers collide. This is a chance-based vulnerability."
