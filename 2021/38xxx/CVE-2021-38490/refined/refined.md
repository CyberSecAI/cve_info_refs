The provided content is related to CVE-2021-37425, not CVE-2021-38490. Therefore, I will respond with the information related to CVE-2021-37425.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The MobileTogether Server resolves user-supplied XML external entities included in HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- XML External Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.
- XML exponential entity expansion leading to denial of service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary file disclosure of non-binary files on the server's filesystem.
- Server-side request forgery (SSRF), enabling access to internal or external resources.
- Denial of service (DoS) due to XML exponential entity expansion exhausting server resources.
- Potential compromise of the server's private key and certificate by reading the configuration file.

**Attack vectors:**
- Sending a crafted HTTP POST request to the `/workflowmanagement` endpoint containing malicious XML data within the `InfoSetChanges/Changes` field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs access to at least one app on the MobileTogether Server. This might involve having an account on the server or using default credentials.
- Knowledge of the target file paths on the server for file disclosure attacks.
- Ability to send HTTP requests to the MobileTogether Server.
