The provided content relates to CVE-2021-38823.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:** The application has a session management issue where signing out from an admin account does not invalidate the session in another browser.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:** Inadequate session management, specifically, session invalidation upon logout.

**Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker who has gained access to an admin account via one browser can potentially retain access to the account using a different browser even after the admin user has logged out of the first browser.

**Attack Vectors:**  An attacker could potentially use a session from a logged-out admin to access restricted admin functionality.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to have gained initial access to an admin account (e.g., via stolen credentials), and access to a different browser where they could potentially use the still-active session.
