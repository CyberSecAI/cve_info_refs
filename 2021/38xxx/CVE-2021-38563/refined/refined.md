      "Root cause of vulnerability": "Multiple vulnerabilities due to improper handling of XFA documents, AcroForms, JavaScript, and update processes.",
      "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Untrusted URL Invocation, Incorrect Signature Verification, Information Disclosure, Use-After-Free, DLL Hijacking, Privilege Escalation, Cross-Site Scripting, Out-of-Bounds Read/Write, Side-Loading, Null Pointer Dereference, Time-of-Check Time-of-Use (TOCTOU) Race Condition, Type Confusion, Arbitrary File Creation, Arbitrary File Execution, GDI Memory Overflow, Infinite Loop, Inadequate Permission Settings, Improper Signature Validation, Weak Randomness, Incorrect Permission Assignment, Incomplete Certificate Check, Missing Manifest File, Missing Appearance Dictionary, Incomplete Isolation of the JavaScript Execution Environment, Inadequate Permission Setting for \"/usr/local/share/foxit\" folder, Improper Synchronization, Incorrect Font Cache Update, Incorrect Permission Assignment on the Resources used by the Update Service, Incomplete Integrity Validation of Updater, Improper Handling of Annotation Object, Use of a Wild Pointer/Null Pointer, Failure to Properly Request User Confirmation, Incorrect Permission Assignment, Incomplete Certificate Check for the Updater, Weak Randomness Setting for the Name of the Temporary Folder During a Plugin Installation, or Improper DLL Loading without Using the Built-in Manifest File",
      "Impact of exploitation": "Remote Code Execution, Information Disclosure, Privilege Escalation, Denial of Service, Arbitrary File Creation/Deletion, Credential Theft, Signature Forgery, Cross-Site Scripting attacks, and DLL hijacking.",
      "Attack vectors": "Crafted PDF documents (including XFA), malformed images (JPEG, TIFF, BMP, etc.), PDF files with embedded JavaScript or Launch File actions, crafted AcroForms, crafted XFA forms, specially crafted U3D/3D page objects, specially crafted annotations or Doc objects, malformed font data, crafted form data, manipulated update files, malicious DLLs, out-of-date updater, or by replacing the update file.",
      "Required attacker capabilities/position": "Attacker needs to craft malicious PDF files (with/without JavaScript or XFA content) or other malformed files, or replace update files. Exploitation often requires user interaction (opening the malicious file).  For privilege escalation vulnerabilities, the attacker may need low-privilege access to the system."
