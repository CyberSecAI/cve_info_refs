### 4.4 RESEARCHER

Michael Heinzl reported these vulnerabilities to CISA.

## 5. MITIGATIONS

**--------- Begin Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------**

Delta Electronics has fixed the reported vulnerabilities and recommends users [upgrade to version 1.9 or later.](https://downloadcenter.deltaww.com/en-US/DownloadCenter?v=1&q=DIAEnergie%20V1.9&sort_expr=cdate&sort_dir=DESC)

**--------- End Update C Part 2 of 2 ---------**

CISA recommends users take defensive measures to minimize the risk of exploitation of  these vulnerabilities. Specifically, users should:

* Minimize network exposure for all control system devices and/or systems, and ensure they are [not accessible from the Internet](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/alerts/ICS-ALERT-10-301-01).
* Locate control system networks and remote devices behind firewalls and isolate them from the business network.
* When remote access is required, use secure methods, such as Virtual Private Networks (VPNs), recognizing VPNs may have vulnerabilities and should be updated to the most current version available. Also recognize VPN is only as secure as its connected devices.

CISA reminds organizations to perform proper impact analysis and risk assessment prior to deploying defensive measures.

CISA also provides a section for [control systems security recommended practices](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics/recommended-practices) on the ICS webpage on [cisa.gov](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/ics). Several recommended practices are available for reading and download, including [Improving Industrial Control Systems Cybersecurity with Defense-in-Depth Strategies](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/recommended_practices/NCCIC_ICS-CERT_Defense_in_Depth_2016_S508C.pdf).

Organizations observing any suspected malicious activity should follow their established internal procedures and report their findings to CISA for tracking and correlation against other incidents.

CISA also recommends users take the following measures to protect themselves from social engineering attacks:

* Do not click web links or open unsolicited attachments in email messages.
* Refer to [Recognizing and Avoiding Email Scams](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on avoiding email scams.
* Refer to [Avoiding Social Engineering and Phishing Attacks](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/sites/default/files/publications/emailscams_0905.pdf) for more information on social engineering attacks.

No known public exploits specifically target these vulnerabilities.
