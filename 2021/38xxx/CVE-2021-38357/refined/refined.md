**Publication Date:** 2021-09-09

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The plugin is vulnerable to Reflected Cross-Site Scripting due to insufficient input sanitization and output escaping.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The plugin directly includes unsanitized user-supplied input from the `position` parameter in the `~/sms-ovh-sent.php` file in the response sent to the user's browser.

**Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject arbitrary web scripts into a page, which can be executed in the context of the user's browser. This can lead to various malicious activities such as session hijacking, stealing sensitive data, or redirecting the user to a malicious website.

**Attack vectors:**  The vulnerability can be exploited by crafting a malicious URL containing the XSS payload in the `position` parameter, and then tricking a user into clicking that link.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this issue. The attacker needs to trick a victim into clicking a malicious URL.
