- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `nxs_ReposterListTable::column_title` function in `inc/nxs_class_snap.php` echoing out the value of `$_REQUEST['page']` without proper sanitization. PHP's behavior of prioritizing `$_POST` over `$_GET` in populating `$_REQUEST` allowed for an attacker to inject malicious JavaScript code into this variable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. The primary weakness is the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input (`$_REQUEST['page']`) before outputting it to the page.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker could execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the browser of a logged-in administrator. This could lead to adding malicious administrative users, inserting backdoors, and ultimately, full site takeover.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves crafting a malicious form that sends a POST request with the `page` parameter set to a malicious JavaScript payload to a vulnerable WordPress administration page (`wp-admin/admin.php?page=nxssnap-post`). The `$_GET['page']` parameter is set to `nxssnap-post` to route the request to the correct page and the injected javascript is executed due to the lack of sanitization.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting a crafted URL or submitting a crafted form that makes a `POST` request to the vulnerable WordPress administration page with the malicious payload. The attacker does not need to be authenticated, just able to trick a logged-in administrator into making a specific request.
