  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-38258",
      "root_cause": "The `wTotalLength` field in the USB configuration descriptor, which is controlled by an attacker, can be set to 0. This leads to allocation of a 0-length buffer, which is later accessed as if it were valid leading to a buffer overflow.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Lack of validation of the `wTotalLength` field in the USB configuration descriptor",
        "Use of `malloc(0)`",
        "Accessing a zero-length buffer as if it was valid",
        "Out of bounds memory access"
      ],
        "impact": "Buffer overflow. Possible arbitrary code execution or denial of service.",
      "attack_vectors": [
         "A malicious USB device sends a crafted configuration descriptor with a `wTotalLength` field set to 0"

     {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-38258",
       "root_cause": "The `wTotalLength` field in the USB configuration descriptor can be less than 8, causing a buffer overread when accessing the `bMaxPower` field.",
      "weaknesses": [
          "Incorrect size calculation when parsing configuration descriptor",
          "Out-of-bounds read"
