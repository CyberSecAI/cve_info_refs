Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities described in the GitHub issue:

**Root Cause of Vulnerabilities:**

*   **SQL Injection:**  User-controlled input is directly embedded into SQL queries without proper sanitization or parameterization.
*   **Command Injection:** User-controlled input is used in the construction of shell commands, allowing for arbitrary code execution.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated SQL Injection:** The `uuid` cookie value is directly used in an SQL query within the `check_login()` function, allowing unauthenticated attackers to perform blind SQL injection.
*   **Authenticated SQL Injection:** Multiple injection points exist within the `select_servers()` function, where user-supplied data (e.g., `server`, `id`, `hostname`) is directly inserted into SQL queries. This can be exploited even by low-privilege accounts like "guest".
*  **Second-Order Command Injection:** User controlled values stored in the database (settings) are used to construct commands, allowing authenticated users to perform command injection. For example, `haproxy_sock_port` setting is used in `get_all_stick_table` function.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Pre-authentication RCE (Remote Code Execution):**  By combining the unauthenticated SQL injection (to obtain a valid UUID) and the command injection, an attacker can achieve remote code execution without needing to log in.
*   **Database Information Disclosure:** The SQL injection vulnerabilities can be used to dump sensitive information from the database, including user credentials and other confidential data.
*   **Arbitrary Command Execution:**  The command injection vulnerabilities allow an attacker to execute arbitrary system commands on the server.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP Requests:**  The unauthenticated SQL injection is triggered by sending a malicious `uuid` cookie value in an HTTP request to any page within the `/app` folder.
*   **Web Interface:**  Authenticated SQL injection can be reached by manipulating various parameters in requests to the web interface, such as when selecting servers or changing configuration settings. Command Injection can be reached through the user settings page and the options page.
*   **Second-order attacks:** Command injection can be achieved using user controlled values stored in database.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Unauthenticated SQLi:** No prior authentication is needed. The attacker just needs to send an crafted HTTP request.
*   **Authenticated SQLi:**  The attacker needs a valid account.  However, the issue mentions that even a "guest" account might be sufficient.
*   **Command Injection:** Attacker needs an authenticated session.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The issue report mentions that the SQL injection vulnerabilities were addressed by switching to Peewee ORM.
*   The command injection was supposedly addressed by adding type checking for parameters, although details of the fix are not specified.
* The report highlights the severity of these issues when combined leading to preauth RCE.
