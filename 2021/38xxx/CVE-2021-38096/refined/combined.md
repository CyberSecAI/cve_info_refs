# FortiGuard IPS Service

Best-in-Class Intrusion Prevention Against Known and Suspicious Threats

[Download Service Brief](/content/dam/fortinet/assets/resources/ser-fortiguard-ips.pdf)

## Overview

The AI/ML-powered FortiGuard IPS Service provides near-real-time intelligence with thousands of intrusion prevention rules to detect and block known and suspicious threats before they ever reach your devices. Natively integrated across the Fortinet Security Fabric, the FortiGuard IPS Service delivers industry-leading IPS performance and efficiency while creating a coordinated network response across your broader Fortinet infrastructure.

### Understanding the FortiGuard IPS Service

The FortiGuard IPS Service provides rich IPS capabilities like deep packet inspection (DPI) and virtual patching to detect and block malicious traffic entering your network.

[![video thumb paper store](data:image/png;base64...)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wjPP480SsaA)

### **Industry-leading IPS by Design**

In both standalone IPS and converged next-generation firewall deployments, the innovative FortiGuard IPS Service is based on a modern, efficient architecture, making performance in even the largest data centers reliably consistent.

[![1. IPS detects a new threat. 2. Telemetry is relayed to FortiGuard Labs. 3. A new signature is developed and deployed to other Fortinet security infrastructure. 4. Customer's broader infrastructure is now protected from the same threat. 5. The new signature is also deployed across Fortinet's entire customer base. IPS integrates with FortiGate, SD-WAN, FortiSWG, FortiClient, FortiADC, and FortiProxy.](data:image/png;base64...)

### How the FortiGuard IPS Service Works

With FortiGuard IPS Service deployed as part of your broader security infrastructure, Fortinet is able to analyze and deploy new intrusion prevention signatures in near real-time for coordinated network response.

Multiply this workflow across Fortinet’s global customer base and you have a network effect that accelerates protection faster than ever.

**Severity level:**Critical

On March 4th, 2021, I discovered and reported multiple (15) zero-day vulnerabilities related to several Corel products. After responding in April, Corel requested an extension to our standard 90-day publication policy to August 1st to remediate these issues. FortiGuard Labs agreed to extend the timing of their disclosure. As this date has now passed without further communications, we are releasing the related Security Advisories for these vulnerabilities. They are identified as:

CVE-2021-38096

CVE-2021-38097

CVE-2021-38098

CVE-2021-38099

CVE-2021-38100

CVE-2021-38101

CVE-2021-38102

CVE-2021-38103

CVE-2021-38104

CVE-2021-38105

CVE-2021-38107

CVE-2021-38108

CVE-2021-38109

CVE-2021-38110

Each of these vulnerabilities has a different root cause related to Corel products and plugins. We recommend that users exercise caution when opening files from unknown sources and update their systems once Corel releases patches for these vulnerabilities.

Following are some details on these vulnerabilities. More information can be found on the related Fortinet Zero-Day Advisory pages by clicking on the CVE links below:
