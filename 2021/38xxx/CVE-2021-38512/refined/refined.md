Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The `actix-http` crate did not properly validate HTTP requests, which allowed for HTTP/1 request smuggling (HRS) attacks.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Lack of input validation on HTTP requests.
- The crate failed to detect invalid requests that could be exploited for HRS.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Potential leakage of internal and/or user data, including credentials.
- This occurs when the `actix-http` crate is used with a vulnerable front-end proxy server.

**Attack Vectors:**
- HTTP/1 requests with specific characteristics that are not properly handled by the `actix-http` crate.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to a system using a vulnerable version of `actix-http` behind a vulnerable front-end proxy.
- No special privileges are required for the attack.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability is related to HTTP/1 request smuggling (HRS).
- It's recommended to keep both the `actix-http` crate and front-end proxy servers up to date.
- Even if the front-end proxy uses HTTP/2, downgrade attacks to HTTP/1 can expose the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability is addressed in `actix-http` versions `2.2.1` and `3.0.0-beta.9` or higher.
