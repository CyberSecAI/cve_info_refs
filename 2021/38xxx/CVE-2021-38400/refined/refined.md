Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-38400:

**CVE-2021-38400:**

*   **Root Cause:** Use of Password Hash with Insufficient Computational Effort
*   **Weakness:** The device stores password hashes that are susceptible to brute-force attacks due to insufficient computational effort used in their generation.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can extract the password hash by removing the hard drive or using a crafted USB device. This allows the attacker to brute-force the password, potentially gaining unauthorized access to the system and sensitive data.
*   **Attack Vector:** Physical access to the affected device is required. The attacker needs to either remove the hard drive or use a specially crafted USB drive to extract the password hash.
*  **Required Attacker Capabilities:** An attacker requires physical access to the Boston Scientific ZOOM LATITUDE Programmer/Recorder/Monitor Model 3120, technical skills to extract the password hash, and the ability to perform brute-force password cracking.

The document also describes other related vulnerabilities affecting the same device, but these are assigned different CVEs.
