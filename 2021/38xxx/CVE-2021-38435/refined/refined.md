Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-38435:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size: The vulnerability arises because the software does not correctly calculate the necessary buffer size when allocating memory. This can lead to a buffer overflow.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Incorrect buffer size calculation (CWE-131) leading to a buffer overflow

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit can lead to a buffer overflow, which may result in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, remote code execution, or information exposure. The provided text only specifies a buffer overflow condition, without specifying information exposure.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is local, meaning an attacker needs to have some form of access to the system to trigger the overflow.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to the system and the ability to trigger the vulnerable code path. This typically means the attacker must have some form of user-level access to the target system.

**Affected Products:**
- Real-Time Innovations (RTI) Connext DDS Professional and Connext DDS Secure versions 4.2x to 6.1.0

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified as CWE-131 (Incorrect Calculation of Buffer Size).
- The CVSS v3 base score is 6.6, with the vector string (AV:L/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:L/A:H) which indicates that an attacker requires local access to exploit it.
