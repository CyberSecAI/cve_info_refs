Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability present in the `Ant_Menu.php` file of SEMCMS SHOP version 1.1.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code into the application's database queries, potentially leading to unauthorized access and data manipulation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Database access:** Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could allow an attacker to gain unauthorized access to the application's database.
- **Data manipulation:** The attacker could potentially modify, delete, or steal sensitive data stored in the database.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability resides within the `Ant_Menu.php` file, suggesting a web-based attack vector via HTTP requests.
- The specific vulnerable parameters or areas of the code are not directly specified, but based on the provided images, it is likely related to user-supplied input being directly included in SQL queries without proper sanitization or escaping.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker would need to be able to send HTTP requests to the affected SEMCMS SHOP instance.
- Knowledge of SQL syntax and database structure may be required for advanced attacks.
- The attacker would need to be able to target the vulnerable `Ant_Menu.php` file and send malicious SQL payloads.
