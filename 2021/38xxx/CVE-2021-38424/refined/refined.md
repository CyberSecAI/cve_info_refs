Based on the provided document, here's the information regarding CVE-2021-38424:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper neutralization of formula elements in a CSV file. Specifically, the tag interface of the affected product allows an attacker to inject formulas into the tag data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Improper Neutralization of Formula Elements in a CSV File (CWE-1236)

**Impact of Exploitation:**
When a user opens a CSV file containing the injected formulas with a spreadsheet application, those formulas are executed. This could lead to:
-Information disclosure: reading sensitive data
-Data modification: changing existing data or executing malicious commands on the user's system
-Denial of service: causing the application to crash or become unresponsive

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the tag interface of the DIALink software. An attacker injects malicious formulas into the tag data.
- This is done by exporting a CSV file containing the injected formulas from the DIALink software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the DIALink application with high privileges.
- The attacker needs to be able to access and export CSV data from the tag interface.
- The user must open the maliciously crafted CSV file using a spreadsheet application for the attack to be successful.

**Additional Notes:**
- This vulnerability is specific to the DIALink product from Delta Electronics, specifically versions 1.2.4.0 and prior.
- The vulnerability has been assigned a CVSS v3 base score of 5.9 (AV:N/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:L), indicating medium severity.
- The vulnerability is related to the way the DIALink software handles data when exported into a CSV file.
- Mitigations include keeping the software up to date with patches when they are available and limiting network exposure.
