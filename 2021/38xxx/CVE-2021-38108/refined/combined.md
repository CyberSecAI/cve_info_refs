**[FortiGuard Labs](https://www.fortinet.com/fortiguard/labs.html?utm_source=blog&utm_medium=campaign&utm_campaign=FortiGuardLabs) Threat Research Report**

**Affected platforms:** Windows 10.

**Impacted parties:**    Users of Corel PDF Fusion version 2.6.2.0.

                                  Users of CorelDraw Standard 2020 versions 22.0.0.474.

                                  Users of Corel WordPerfect 2020 version 20.0.0.200.

                                  Users of Corel PhotoPaint Standard 2020 version 22.0.0.474.

                                  Users of Corel Presentations 2020 version 20.0.0.200.

**Impact:**                     Multiple vulnerabilities leading to arbitrary code execution and information leaks

**Severity level:**Critical

On March 4th, 2021, I discovered and reported multiple (15) zero-day vulnerabilities related to several Corel products. After responding in April, Corel requested an extension to our standard 90-day publication policy to August 1st to remediate these issues. FortiGuard Labs agreed to extend the timing of their disclosure. As this date has now passed without further communications, we are releasing the related Security Advisories for these vulnerabilities. They are identified as:

CVE-2021-38096

CVE-2021-38097

CVE-2021-38098

CVE-2021-38099

CVE-2021-38100

CVE-2021-38101

CVE-2021-38102

CVE-2021-38103

CVE-2021-38104

CVE-2021-38105

CVE-2021-38106

CVE-2021-38107

CVE-2021-38108

CVE-2021-38109

CVE-2021-38110

Each of these vulnerabilities has a different root cause related to Corel products and plugins. We recommend that users exercise caution when opening files from unknown sources and update their systems once Corel releases patches for these vulnerabilities.

Following are some details on these vulnerabilities. More information can be found on the related Fortinet Zero-Day Advisory pages by clicking on the CVE links below:
