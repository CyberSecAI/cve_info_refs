The provided content describes the "Glowworm attack," which is a TEMPEST attack that recovers sound by analyzing the optical emanations from a device's power indicator LED. This attack exploits the correlation between a device's power consumption and the intensity of its power LED.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The power indicator LED of various devices is directly connected to the power line.
*   The intensity of a device's power indicator LED is correlated to the device's power consumption.
*   Many devices lack a dedicated mechanism to counter this phenomenon.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Optical Emanations:** The power LED emits light that fluctuates in intensity with changes in power consumption, which is influenced by audio output.
*   **Lack of Shielding/Filtering:** Devices do not adequately filter or shield the power circuitry to prevent the LED's light intensity from being modulated by sound-related power fluctuations.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Sound Recovery:** An attacker can recover speech and other audio played by a device from a distance.
*   **Eavesdropping:** This attack allows for eavesdropping on conversations or audio played through the compromised device.
*   **Privacy Breach:** Sensitive information transmitted via audio can be intercepted.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Optical Measurement:** An attacker uses an electro-optical sensor to measure the light intensity fluctuations of a device's power indicator LED.
*   **Distance:** The attack is viable from a distance, with experiments showing successful recovery at 15 meters with good intelligibility and 35 meters with fair intelligibility.
*   **Device Type:** The attack is applicable to various devices, such as speakers, USB hub splitters, and microcontrollers.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Electro-Optical Sensor:** The attacker needs a specialized sensor to measure light intensity with sufficient sensitivity and sampling rate.
*   **Line of Sight:** The attacker needs a line of sight to the target device's power LED.
*   **Signal Processing:** The attacker needs to perform signal processing to isolate the audio signal from the measured light intensity fluctuations.

**Additional Information:**

*   The attack is different from the Lamphone attack, which uses vibrations of a light bulb to recover sound. The Glowworm attack exploits the design of the electrical circuits and the correlation with the power LED.
*   Video cameras are not suitable for the attack due to their limited FPS rate.
*   The research indicates that about 50% of the analyzed devices are vulnerable. Some of the vulnerable manufacturers include Google, Logitech, JBL, Sony, CREATIVE, TP-Link, Miracase and Raspberry Pi.
