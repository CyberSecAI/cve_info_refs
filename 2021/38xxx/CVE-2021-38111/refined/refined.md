{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the Near Field Magnetic Inductance (NFMI) communication protocol implementation of the DEF CON 27 badge.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": [
    "Buffer Overflow: An oversized packet sent via NFMI can cause a buffer overflow, leading to a crash.",
     "Insecure handling of packet lengths. The code does not validate the packet length resulting in overflow"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can remotely crash the badge via NFMI with a crafted oversized packet.",
  "Attack vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited by sending a specially crafted oversized packet via the Near Field Magnetic Inductance (NFMI) communication channel.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be within the NFMI communication range of the badge and must be able to transmit crafted NFMI packets."
