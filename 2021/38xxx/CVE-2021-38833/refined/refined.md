    "description": "SQL injection vulnerability in PHPGurukul Apartment Visitors Management System (AVMS) v. 1.0 allows attackers to execute arbitrary SQL statements and to gain RCE. The PHPGurukul Apartment Visitors Management System (AVMS) v. 1.0 is also vulnerable to remote SQL-Injection-Bypass-Authentication for the admin account and the application is vulnerable to XSS-SORED vulnerability and PHPSESSID-Hijacking.",
    "root_cause": "The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to insufficient input sanitization and validation, allowing injection of arbitrary SQL queries.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "SQL Injection",
      "Remote SQL-Injection-Bypass-Authentication",
      "XSS-SORED",
      "PHPSESSID-Hijacking"
    ],
    "impact": "Attackers can execute arbitrary SQL statements, potentially leading to remote code execution (RCE), bypass authentication, steal session cookies and perform cross-site scripting (XSS) attacks.",
      "attack_vector": "The vulnerability is exploited through the username field in the login form where an attacker can inject a malicious SQL query.",
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker only needs to have network access to the login page of the vulnerable application. They do not need any privileged access to the system itself."
