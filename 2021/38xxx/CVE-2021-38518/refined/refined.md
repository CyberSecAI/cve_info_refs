The provided content is a security advisory for a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, which is relevant to the analysis of CVE-2021-38518.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command Injection vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the device, potentially allowing the attacker to control the router, access the network, and intercept or manipulate data. The CVSS score indicates High impact in Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Attack vectors:** The attack is performed after successful authentication to the device's management interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the router's management interface. This implies the attacker is either an authorized user or has obtained unauthorized access to a user's credentials.

**Affected products and firmware versions:**

*   RAX200, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.120
*   RAX75, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.120
*   RAX80, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.120
*   RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12

**Additional Notes:**
* The advisory has a CVSS v3 score of 8.4 and vector string of CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H which corresponds to high impact.
* The vulnerability is fixed in firmware versions 1.0.4.120 for RAX200, RAX75, RAX80 and 3.2.17.12 for RBK852, RBR850, and RBS850.
