Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-38305:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The Yamale schema parser uses Python's `eval()` function to process schema definitions, specifically to make validators available. It attempts to mitigate risks by limiting the built-ins that are passed to `eval()`. However, a carefully crafted string within the schema can bypass these restrictions and execute arbitrary system commands.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe use of `eval()`:** The core vulnerability stems from using `eval()` on untrusted input (schema definitions).
- **Insufficient sanitization:** While there's an attempt to limit built-in functions available to `eval()`, the sanitization is not comprehensive, enabling attackers to craft malicious payloads.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** A successful exploit allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the system running Yamale, potentially leading to a complete compromise of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious Schema File:** An attacker needs to supply a malicious schema file to the Yamale validator.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to provide schema:** An attacker must be able to provide a malicious schema to the Yamale application. This could be achieved through various means depending on how Yamale is used.
- **No specific privilege required:** The attacker does not need special privileges on the target system.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerability is present in Yamale versions before 3.0.8 and is fixed in version 3.0.8.
- The fix involves limiting the strings passed to `eval()` to those that start with known validator names.
