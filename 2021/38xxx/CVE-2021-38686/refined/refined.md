- **Root cause of vulnerability**: Improper authentication in QVR.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The vulnerability is categorized as improper authentication, indicating a flaw in how the system verifies user identity or permissions. This could involve issues such as weak credentials, bypassing authentication mechanisms, or inadequate session management.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows attackers to compromise the security of the system. This could mean unauthorized access to the NVR system and its surveillance data, modification of system settings, or the execution of arbitrary code.
- **Attack vectors**: The specific attack vector is not detailed, however, it stems from the network and the application itself.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access to the QNAP VS Series NVR running the vulnerable QVR version, and the ability to exploit the authentication flaws.
