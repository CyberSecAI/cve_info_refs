The provided content relates to CVE-2021-38752.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue in the Online Catering Reservation System, a PHP application available on SourceCodester.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The application is vulnerable to XSS, likely due to insufficient sanitization or encoding of user-supplied data before rendering it in the web page.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page. This could lead to various impacts, such as:
*   Stealing user session cookies, leading to account hijacking
*   Redirecting users to malicious websites
*   Defacing the website
*   Performing actions on behalf of the user without their consent.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code via a user-supplied input field that is displayed back to the user without proper sanitization or encoding.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be able to provide input that will be rendered within the web application. This could be through any user-facing input field that is not properly sanitized. No special network position is required to inject.
