The provided content is related to a post-authentication stack overflow vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR routers, gateways, and extenders.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stack overflow vulnerability in the firmware of the affected devices. The vulnerability is triggered after successful authentication.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Post-authentication stack overflow.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary code execution, denial of service, or other undefined behavior.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be authenticated to the device before exploiting the vulnerability. This implies the attacker needs a valid username and password, or another means of authentication, to access the affected device's management interface.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is identified by NETGEAR as PSV-2018-0378.
- A list of affected devices and vulnerable firmware versions is provided.
- NETGEAR recommends updating the firmware to the latest version to mitigate the vulnerability.
- The CVSS v3 score is 9.8 with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating a high severity vulnerability exploitable by an adjacent attacker with high privileges, with no user interaction required, resulting in high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
