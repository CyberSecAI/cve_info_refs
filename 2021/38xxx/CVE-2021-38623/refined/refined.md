- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The "Deferred image processing" extension incorrectly uses the TYPO3 FAL API, causing processed image file copies to be saved in the `/var/transient/` folder on every frontend request.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Improper use of the TYPO3 FAL API leads to uncontrolled file creation and storage.
- **Impact of exploitation:** A large number of requests can rapidly fill up the webspace with image files leading to a Denial of Service (DoS).
- **Attack vectors:** Sending a large amount of requests to the website triggers the vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to send requests to the website.
