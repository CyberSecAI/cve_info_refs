**Attack Vectors:**
*   **Network Sniffing:** An attacker positioned on the network path between the client and the server can capture the unprotected credentials.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker can intercept communication and capture credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be on the same network or have the ability to intercept network traffic between the client and server.
