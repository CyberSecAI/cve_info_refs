- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The Jazz Team Server is vulnerable to cross-site scripting because it includes data from an HTTP request within the immediate response in an unsafe way. Specifically, the `crypto_js` parameter is vulnerable.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious scripts into the web page which will be executed in the user's browser, potentially leading to data theft, session hijacking, or other malicious activities.
- **Attack vectors**: Sending a crafted HTTP request with a malicious script in the `crypto_js` parameter.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Jazz Team Server.
