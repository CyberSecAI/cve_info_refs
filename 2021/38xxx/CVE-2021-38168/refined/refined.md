{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The application suffers from multiple vulnerabilities due to insufficient input sanitization and insecure coding practices. Specifically, user-supplied input is directly used in SQL queries and system commands without proper validation.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Unauthenticated SQL Injection: The application directly uses the 'uuid' cookie value in an SQL query within the `update_last_act_user` function, without sanitization.",
       "Authenticated SQL Injection: Multiple functions, like `select_servers`, construct SQL queries by concatenating user-provided input from parameters such as `server`, `id`, and `hostname` without proper sanitization.",
      "Command Injection: User-controlled settings, such as `haproxy_sock_port`, are used in system commands within functions like `get_all_stick_table`, which allows for command injection. Also, there are second-order command injections where user-controlled settings in the database are later used in command executions."
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation of these vulnerabilities can lead to:\n    - Pre-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE):\n        - The unauthenticated SQL injection allows attackers to extract valid UUIDs.\n        - With a valid UUID, the attacker can bypass authentication and exploit command injections for arbitrary code execution.\n     - Data Breach: SQL injection can be used to dump the entire database, exposing sensitive information.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Unauthenticated SQLi: By manipulating the 'uuid' cookie value and sending a request to any page within the `/app` folder.",
      "Authenticated SQLi: By sending crafted requests to endpoints that call vulnerable functions like `select_servers`, especially with parameters such as `server`, `id`, `hostname`, and `id_hostname`.",
      "Command Injection: By modifying settings, particularly `haproxy_sock_port`, and triggering functions that use this setting in system commands."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application. No prior authentication is required to exploit the unauthenticated SQL injection and, subsequently, the command injection. An attacker with minimal privileges, such as a guest account, is sufficient to exploit authenticated SQL injection vulnerabilities."
