- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is due to a Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) issue in the B2B API of IBM Sterling B2B Integrator.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) vulnerability. This likely means that the API did not properly restrict the origins from which it would accept requests, potentially allowing unauthorized access from malicious websites.
- **Impact of exploitation**: The impact is not explicitly stated but a CORS vulnerability can allow an attacker to make unauthorized API requests on behalf of a user, potentially leading to data breaches or other malicious activity.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector involves exploiting the improperly configured CORS policy in the B2B API. An attacker would need to craft a malicious web page that sends requests to the vulnerable API.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to host a malicious website or control a website that a victim user visits.
