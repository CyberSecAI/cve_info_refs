**CVE-2021-38352**

*   **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The plugin is vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting due to insufficient input validation.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: The plugin doesn't properly sanitize the `feedify_msg` parameter found in the `~/includes/base.php` file.
*   **Impact of Exploitation**: Attackers can inject and execute arbitrary web scripts within the context of a user's browser session, potentially leading to malicious actions such as session hijacking, data theft or redirecting to malicious sites.
*   **Attack Vectors**: An attacker can craft a malicious URL containing the payload in the `feedify_msg` parameter. If a user clicks this URL, the malicious script will be executed within the context of the user's browser.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: The attacker needs to be able to create and disseminate a malicious link. No authentication is required. The user needs to click on the malicious link.
