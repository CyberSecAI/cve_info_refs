The content is related to CVE-2021-45542. It provides information about a post-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting several NETGEAR router and WiFi system models.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection, meaning it can be exploited after successful login to the device's administrative interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input which is then used in a system command, allowing for command injection.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device with the privileges of the user logged into the admin interface. This can lead to complete control of the device including data exfiltration, denial of service and potentially pivot to other devices on the network.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is network-based, requiring the attacker to have already authenticated to the device's administrative interface.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have valid admin credentials to log in to the router's administrative interface before exploiting this vulnerability. The CVSS vector indicates that the attack requires high privileges.

The document also provides information on affected product models, the fixed firmware versions, and instructions on how to update the firmware. The document includes a CVSS score and vector string.
