Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45884:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a CNAME uncloaking issue in the SOCKS5 protocol when a proxy extension with SOCKS fallback is enabled.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- CNAME uncloaking: The browser incorrectly reveals the actual destination of a request when using a SOCKS5 proxy with a proxy extension. This is because the proxy extension may not properly handle CNAME resolution, revealing the true hostname behind a CNAME record.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Privacy violation: An attacker can potentially learn the real hostnames a user is accessing even if the user is attempting to anonymize their traffic through a proxy. This could be used to track users.

**Attack Vectors:**
- An attacker needs to set up a web server that uses a CNAME record. 
- The attacker then needs to trick the user into visiting a page or using a service that makes a request to this CNAME. 
- The user needs to have a proxy extension with SOCKS fallback enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to control a domain and its DNS settings to create a CNAME record.
- The attacker has to entice a user to visit a specific website or service.
- The user has to have a SOCKS5 proxy with proxy extension enabled.

**Additional details:**
- The fix involves disabling CNAME uncloaking when a proxy extension with a SOCKS fallback is enabled.
- The vulnerability was reported via HackerOne, Report #1377864
- The fix was implemented in Brave core with pull request #10742 and is included in the 1.33.x release.
- The provided test plan involves using the Proxy SwitchyOmega extension to reproduce the issue.
- The patch addresses both `PROXY_LIST` and `PROXY_LIST_PER_SCHEME` proxy rules types.
