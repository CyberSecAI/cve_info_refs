## Test Plan:

1. Install the [Proxy SwitchyOmega](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/proxy-switchyomega/padekgcemlokbadohgkifijomclgjgif) extension
2. In the extension settings page, set the Proxy Servers section to have a single entry, as follows:

   | Scheme | Protocol | Server | Port |
   | --- | --- | --- | --- |
   | (default) | SOCKS5 | 127.0.0.1 | 8081 |
3. Clear the "Bypass List" section in the extension settings page
4. Ensure the above changes are applied by clicking the "Apply changes" button in the left column
5. Start a SOCKS5 proxy server on the device. This can be done by entering `ssh 127.0.0.1 -D 8081` on Linux and probably macOS. You're welcome to run it on a different device, but the Proxy Servers setting above will need to be modified accordingly.
6. Add the following line to the `Custom filters` section in brave://adblock:
   ```
   ||dev-pages.brave.software/static/images/test.jpg

   ```
7. Visit <https://test-cname.brave.software/cname-uncloaking.html>
8. Use the Proxy SwitchyOmega icon in the "puzzle piece" extensions menu to enable `proxy` mode (should be the 3rd option).
9. Press the `Run test` button
10. The request should be `allowed` (green).
11. In the "puzzle piece" extensions menu, change to `[System Proxy]` and run the test again. The request should be `blocked` (red).
12. In the "puzzle piece" extensions menu, change to `[Direct]` and run the test again. The request should be `blocked` (red).

We need unit test for `ProxySettingsAllowUncloaking`

but since we need to get this out ASAP, it can be done as follow up
