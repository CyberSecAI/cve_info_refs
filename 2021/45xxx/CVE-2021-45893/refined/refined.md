Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45893:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The ZA|ARC application converts user passwords to uppercase before storing them in the database. This conversion also occurs when a user attempts to log in.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Improper Handling of Case Sensitivity (CWE-178):** The application's case conversion of passwords before storage and login creates a vulnerability. The system effectively treats "Password" and "password" as the same, allowing an attacker to bypass normal password complexity requirements.
- **Password Guessing Vulnerability:** An attacker can easily bypass the intended security by only guessing passwords using either solely uppercase or lowercase, as the application effectively treats them as identical. This reduces the search space and facilitates password cracking.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to gain unauthorized access to user accounts by guessing passwords more efficiently.
- **Compromise of Sensitive Data:** The attacker could potentially gain access to the application's functionalities, potentially compromising sensitive archived data related to digital tachographs.
- **Non-compliance with password policies:** Due to the case insensitivity issue, the application may not comply with standard password complexity policies and could be considered insecure in a corporate environment.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Login Page:** The attacker interacts with the application's login interface, attempting to authenticate with modified passwords (all-uppercase or all-lowercase).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker requires network access to the ZA|ARC application.
- **Basic Knowledge:** The attacker needs knowledge that the application converts passwords to uppercase. No sophisticated tools or specific exploits are required, only basic username and password entry to the application's login interface.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability only affects passwords stored in the BENUTZER table, column PASSWORT, and not those in the TMPASSWORT column.
- The vendor has stated they will not fix this issue in ZA|ARC and recommends upgrading to zaarc.next when it becomes available.
