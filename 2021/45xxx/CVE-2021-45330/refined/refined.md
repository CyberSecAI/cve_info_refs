The provided content discusses a security issue in Gitea, specifically that logging out only deletes browser cookies, which is tracked as issue #4336. While it is tagged with "topic/security," it does not mention any CVE ID. Therefore, it is **UNRELATED** to CVE-2021-45330.

The content describes the following:

**Weakness:**
- When logging out of Gitea, only browser cookies are deleted. This leaves the session active on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- If a user logs out but their session is still active server-side, a malicious actor could potentially regain access to the user's account if they are able to reuse the session identifier.
- The report also notes that the problem is more serious when the "Remember Me" checkbox is used during login, suggesting the issue may persist over multiple browser sessions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The described vulnerability is exploitable if the attacker can obtain a user's active session identifier after they have logged out, potentially through network sniffing, or access to a computer with an active session and "Remember Me" enabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need to gain access to a valid session identifier, likely by capturing network traffic, accessing the user's computer, or exploiting other vulnerabilities which could lead to session hijacking.
