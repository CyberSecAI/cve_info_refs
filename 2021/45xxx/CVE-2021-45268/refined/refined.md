Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause of the vulnerability is the lack of Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF) protection in Backdrop CMS version 1.20. Specifically, the CMS allows plugins to be added via ZIP files uploaded to the site, and this process lacks CSRF protection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Request Forgery (CSRF):** The primary vulnerability is the absence of CSRF protection when installing plugins via a URL. This allows an attacker to craft a malicious HTML page that, when visited by an authenticated administrator, can trigger an installation of a malicious plugin without the administrator's knowledge or consent.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the CSRF vulnerability, an attacker can upload a malicious plugin containing a PHP file (e.g., shell.php) that enables remote command execution on the hosting webserver. This allows the attacker to gain complete control over the server.
*   **Administrative Access:** The exploit can be used to add new admin users and achieve administrative access by adding a new user with admin powers using CSRF.

**Attack Vectors:**

1.  **Malicious Plugin Hosting:** The attacker creates a malicious plugin containing a PHP shell file and hosts it on a server accessible via URL.
2.  **CSRF Payload:** The attacker crafts a malicious HTML page containing a form that uses the administrator's session to upload and install the malicious plugin via the installer. This form contains all necessary parameters to bypass the form protection by providing all necessary values.
3.  **Victim Interaction:** The attacker tricks the victim into visiting the malicious HTML page. When the administrator visits the page, their browser automatically submits the form to the vulnerable Backdrop CMS installation. The system then downloads the malicious plugin from the URL and installs it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must be able to host a malicious plugin and the malicious HTML page used to trigger the CSRF vulnerability.
*   The attacker needs to know the URL of the targeted Backdrop CMS installation.
*   The attacker needs to trick a logged-in administrator into visiting the malicious HTML page.

**Additional Details:**

* The exploit-db content contains the necessary HTML code to perform CSRF to both add an admin user and upload a malicious plugin for RCE.
* The GitHub content provides a complete description of the attack scenario and also contains the same HTML payload as the exploit-db entry.
* The provided exploit demonstrates the practical attack.
