The provided content details multiple SQL injection vulnerabilities in the Simple Forum-Discussion System 1.0.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied inputs before using them in SQL queries, leading to SQL injection vulnerabilities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerabilities in `manage_topic.php`, `manage_user.php`, and `ajax.php`.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Attackers can retrieve sensitive information from the database, potentially including user credentials, posts, and other data.
-  The attacker can potentially gain complete control of the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The application is vulnerable via HTTP GET and POST requests using parameters like `id` and `username`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No special privileges are required; an attacker with network access can exploit these vulnerabilities.

**Technical Details:**

The following vulnerable parameters and payloads are provided in the document:
* **Parameter: id (GET)**
    *  Time-based blind SQL Injection using `SLEEP()` function.
    *  Union-based SQL Injection to extract data.
* **Parameter: id (GET) with mtype=own**
    * Boolean-based blind SQL Injection
    * Time-based blind SQL Injection using `SLEEP()` function.
    * Union-based SQL Injection to extract data.
* **Parameter: username (POST)**
    * Time-based blind SQL Injection using `SLEEP()` function.

The exploit payloads include examples of time-based blind injections, boolean-based blind injections, and union-based injections.
