The provided content is related to a security advisory for a post-authentication command injection vulnerability in certain NETGEAR Orbi WiFi systems. Although the advisory does not explicitly state the CVE number, it references the vulnerability as "PSV-2020-0067," and it is confirmed that this advisory refers to the same vulnerability as CVE-2021-45564 based on the description.

Here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information:

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection issue.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The system allows for the injection of malicious commands after a user has successfully authenticated.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system. The CVSS score indicates high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the affected device.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated on the system (PR:H - High Privileges required), meaning the attacker would need valid user credentials.
