The provided content includes information about CVE-2021-45981.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to the processing of XML data, specifically the improper handling of external entities.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is an XML External Entity (XXE) injection. This occurs when an XML parser processes XML input containing a reference to an external entity, which it resolves to include the content of the external entity, potentially including local or network resources.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to read arbitrary files on the server where nGeniusONE is running.

**Attack vectors:**
An attacker can inject malicious XML data into the application's input that contains an external entity pointing to a file on the server. The application processes this XML data and attempts to retrieve and include the external entity, resulting in arbitrary file read.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker must be able to send XML data to a vulnerable endpoint in the nGeniusONE application. The attack complexity is rated as high, privileges required are none, and user interaction is required.
