The provided content is related to a post-authentication command injection vulnerability in several Netgear Orbi products, identified as PSV-2020-0091, and provides information on affected devices and firmware versions. Although the advisory does not have an associated CVE ID it is still useful.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability exists.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This could lead to a compromise of the device and potentially the network it is connected to.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a post-authentication command injection. This means that an attacker needs to authenticate to the device's management interface first to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to access and authenticate to the device's management interface.

**Affected Products:**
