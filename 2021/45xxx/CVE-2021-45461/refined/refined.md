Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- A regression in the `restapps` module of FreePBX, introduced by recent changes aimed at fixing bugs related to phone apps in specific network environments. This regression reintroduced a vulnerability that was previously present in the code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- The `restapps` module, specifically versions `16.0.18.40`, `16.0.18.41`, `15.0.19.87`, and `15.0.19.88`, contained a remote code execution (RCE) vulnerability. This vulnerability could be exploited even if Phone Apps weren't actively used in a licensed capacity.
- The vulnerability exists in the code that handles requests to the `restapps` module through HTTP/HTTPS. It is not specific to the `restapps` port (88 and 96).
-  The exploit could be triggered through the admin interface (ports 80 and 443).

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- Successful exploitation of the vulnerability allowed attackers to execute arbitrary code on the affected FreePBX system.
- The vulnerability was actively being exploited, with reports of malicious activity on live systems.
- Exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the PBX system, with potential for data theft, service disruption, and other malicious activities (such as making outbound calls to foreign numbers)

**Attack Vectors:**

- The primary attack vector is through HTTP/HTTPS requests to the affected `restapps` module.
- Attackers can target the admin interface on the standard ports 80 and 443 as well as specific restapps ports (88,96).
- The exploit does not require the `freepbx_ha` module, even though the vulnerability may mask itself using it.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- Attackers need network access to the FreePBX system's HTTP/HTTPS ports (typically 80 and 443) or to the restapps specific ports (88,96) .
- No specific authentication or privileges are mentioned as a pre-requisite, implying that exploitation may be possible without prior access to the system.

**Additional Details:**

- The affected module versions were initially published around December 11, 2021.
- The vulnerability was fixed in `restapps` module versions `16.0.19` and `15.0.20`, released on December 22, 2021.
- The exploit was initially discovered and reported by community members, who also assisted in the investigation.
- Downgrading to earlier versions of the `restapps` module (e.g. `15.0.19.86`, `15.0.19.85`, or `16.0.18.39`) is a temporary mitigation.
-  Blocking the restapps ports alone is insufficient to mitigate this vulnerability.
- Uninstalling the `restapps` module can also prevent exploitation.
