Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45892:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from the use of a weak, custom "password encryption" algorithm within the ZA|ARC software. This algorithm is used for storing user passwords in the database and database credentials in the `zaarc.ini` configuration file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Password Storage:** Instead of using industry-standard robust encryption or hashing techniques, the software relies on a custom algorithm that is easily reverse-engineered.
*   **Recoverable Passwords:** The custom encryption algorithm is reversible, meaning that encrypted passwords can be decrypted to reveal their plaintext values.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Disclosure of Plaintext Passwords:** An attacker who gains access to the database or the `zaarc.ini` file can easily recover plaintext passwords for both application users and database credentials.
*   **Potential for Further Attacks:**  Compromised user accounts or database access credentials could allow an attacker to gain control over the ZA|ARC software, access sensitive archived data, and potentially pivot to other systems in the network.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Database Access:** An attacker could gain access to the database containing the encrypted passwords. This could be achieved through a SQL injection vulnerability, a compromised database account, or other methods of data exfiltration.
*   **Configuration File Access:** An attacker could gain access to the `zaarc.ini` file containing configuration data. This could occur if an attacker gains access to the server or file share hosting this file.
*   **Reverse Engineering:** The decryption algorithm can be reverse engineered from the ZA|ARC executable if the attacker has access to the software.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Access to the Database or Configuration Files:** An attacker needs access to the database where passwords are stored or the `zaarc.ini` configuration file where database credentials may be stored.
*   **Ability to Retrieve Encrypted Passwords:** The attacker must be able to obtain the encrypted password data, which may involve SQL queries or file access.
*   **Knowledge of the Custom Algorithm (Optional but useful):** While the custom algorithm can be reverse engineered, an attacker will be able to recover passwords more quickly with knowledge of the algorithm.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vendor has stated that they will not fix this vulnerability in the affected version (4.2.0.4). Users are advised to upgrade to `zaarc.next` when available.
*   A proof-of-concept Python script was created by SySS to demonstrate the vulnerability. However, it was not included in the advisory due to the absence of a public fix at the time of disclosure.
*   The advisory explicitly mentions the storage of passwords in the `BENUTZER` table under the columns `PASSWORT` and `TMPASSWORT`, further highlighting the nature of the vulnerability.
