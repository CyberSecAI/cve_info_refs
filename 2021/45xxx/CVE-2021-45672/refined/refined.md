The provided content is related to a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router models. While the advisory doesn't explicitly mention CVE-2021-45672, it details a similar vulnerability and the affected products, along with necessary remediation steps. Therefore, it will be treated as related.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a stored Cross-Site Scripting vulnerability present in the firmware of the listed NETGEAR routers.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS): Malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the router's web interface, which can then be executed by other users accessing the interface.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the browser of a user who accesses the router's web interface.
- This could lead to various malicious actions, such as:
    - Session hijacking
    - Defacement of the web interface
    - Unauthorized modification of router settings
    - Phishing attacks targeting users of the router's web interface

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected NETGEAR routers.
- An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious JavaScript code that gets stored persistently. The specific method of injection is not detailed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- An attacker would need some level of access or knowledge of the router's web interface to inject the malicious script. The level of privilege required is not explicitly mentioned but is likely to require administrator-level access to inject the script, although the impact is on any user accessing the interface.
- The attacker may not need direct access to the local network. If the affected setting is accessible remotely, the attacker might be able to inject the script remotely.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory lists specific vulnerable models and firmware versions.
- The advisory recommends updating to the latest firmware to remediate the vulnerability.
- A CVSS score of 4.2 is given with a vector of CVSS:3.0/AV:L/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N. This indicates that the vulnerability is exploitable locally with high privileges with a user interaction and the scope is changed resulting in low confidentiality and integrity impact with no availability impact.
