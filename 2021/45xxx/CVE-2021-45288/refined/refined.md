- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A double free vulnerability exists in the `gf_odf_del_default` function, which is called during the processing of a crafted MP4 file. This double free occurs because the same memory is being freed twice.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Double free.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The double free vulnerability leads to a program crash (abort) due to memory corruption.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a specially crafted MP4 file to the `MP4Box` utility via the `-bt` option.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to provide the crafted MP4 file as input to the `MP4Box` utility.
