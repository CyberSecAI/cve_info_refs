Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is an incorrect data type used for storing the header size (`hdrSize`) in the `DTSStreamReader::findFrame` function, specifically it used `int` where it should be `uint64_t`
- This resulted in a heap overflow due to the size calculation, when the value read was larger than max `int` value.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Integer overflow: The use of an `int` to store a size value that could exceed the maximum value of an `int`, leading to incorrect calculations of memory addresses.
- Memory Corruption: The incorrect size calculation leads to an out-of-bounds read, which can cause a segmentation fault and potentially other memory corruption issues.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): The immediate impact is a segmentation fault, crashing the application.
- Potential for arbitrary code execution: Memory corruption vulnerabilities can often be chained with other vulnerabilities to gain arbitrary code execution, but that specific information is not in the provided content.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector involves providing a specially crafted input file to the `tsMuxer` application, specifically a file that results in a DTS stream with a header size exceeding the maximum value of an integer. This occurs in the processing of DTS audio streams.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs the ability to provide an input file to the `tsMuxer` application. This could be through a command-line argument, a file read from disk or a network stream.

**Additional details:**

- The vulnerability is located in `DTSStreamReader::findFrame` function in `dtsStreamReader.cpp` line 193
- The fix was to change `hdrSize` to be a `uint64_t` type

```
[bug] hdrSize should be uint64_t
```
- This issue was reported on Oct 18, 2021 and fixed the next day.
