Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-45990:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a command injection flaw found in the `uploadPicture` function of Tenda routers G1 and G3.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The `pic_name` parameter within the `uploadPicture` function does not properly sanitize user-supplied input, allowing for the injection of arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Arbitrary Command Execution: Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the affected Tenda routers.
- Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation can lead to complete compromise of the router, potentially allowing attackers to control network traffic, access sensitive data, or further propagate attacks.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Remote Attack: The vulnerability can be exploited remotely.
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device.
- HTTP request to the `uploadPicture` function, injecting malicious commands within the `pic_name` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker must be able to reach the router via the network.
- No authentication is required to trigger the command injection vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
- Affected Products: Tenda G1 and G3 routers with firmware version 15.11.0.17(9502)_CN are vulnerable.
- Severity: The vulnerability is rated as critical with a CVSS v3 base score of 9.8 and a CVSS v2 base score of 7.5.
- The vulnerability allows for unauthenticated remote attackers to execute arbitrary commands.
