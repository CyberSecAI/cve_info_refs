Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability described for CVE-2021-45418:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a directory traversal vulnerability present in the `main.cgi` web application.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Directory Traversal:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass intended directory restrictions, enabling them to navigate to arbitrary locations within the server's file system.
- **Unrestricted File Upload:**  This traversal vulnerability enables authenticated users to upload arbitrary files to the server, potentially overwriting existing files or placing malicious files in locations that facilitate code execution.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By exploiting the directory traversal and uploading malicious executable files, an attacker can achieve remote code execution on the affected system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface (CGI):** The vulnerability is exposed through the web interface of the device using the `main.cgi` application.
- **File Upload:** The attack relies on the ability to upload files to the server via the vulnerable `main.cgi` application.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Authentication:** An attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the web interface.
- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to reach the web interface of the affected device over the network.

**Affected Products and Versions:**

| Product            | Affected Versions  | Mitigated Versions |
|--------------------|-------------------|--------------------|
| Nova 360 Cabinet   | <= 1.3.0.0.7b102  | Beta1.3.0.1.0      |
| Titan 180 Premium | <= 1.3.0.0.6     | 1.3.0.0.9         |

**Additional Notes**
- A Proof-of-Concept (POC) is referenced with a file path to an image file `poc/CVE-2021-45418.png`, which likely demonstrates the directory traversal aspect.
