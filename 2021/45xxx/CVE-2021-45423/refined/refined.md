- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `pe_exports` function in `exports.c` allocates a stack buffer `offsets_to_Names` based on `exp->NumberOfFunctions`, but iterates through it using `exp->NumberOfNames` when populating it. This can lead to an out-of-bounds write if `exp->NumberOfNames` is larger than `exp->NumberOfFunctions`, because the ordinal value is used as index into the `offsets_to_Names` array.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Out-of-bounds write due to a size mismatch in array allocation and indexing. Specifically, the code does not validate if `ordinal` is less than `exp->NumberOfFunctions` before writing to `offsets_to_Names[ordinal]`.
- **Impact of exploitation**: By crafting a PE file with an `ordinal` value greater than or equal to `exp->NumberOfFunctions`, an attacker can overwrite stack memory, including the return address of the `pe_exports` function. This allows for arbitrary code execution, especially on older systems like Windows 7 and Windows Server 2008, where a ROP chain could be used.
- **Attack vectors**: The vulnerability is triggered by parsing a maliciously crafted PE file.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs the ability to supply a specially crafted PE file to be processed by the vulnerable `readpe.exe` program, specifically manipulating the `NumberOfFunctions`, `NumberOfNames`, and ordinal values.
