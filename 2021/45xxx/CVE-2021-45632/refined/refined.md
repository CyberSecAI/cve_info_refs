This document provides information about a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting several Netgear WiFi systems.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a pre-authentication command injection flaw. This means an attacker can inject malicious commands into the system without needing to log in.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: The system fails to properly sanitize input, allowing an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands.
- Pre-Authentication: The vulnerability is exploitable before authentication, making it highly dangerous since no credentials are required to trigger it.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to:
-  Complete compromise of the affected system (Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability impact is high)
-  Arbitrary code execution
-  Potential for further network attacks

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is adjacent, meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device (local network).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network (adjacent) as the vulnerable Netgear device.
- No authentication is required.
- No special user interaction is needed for exploitation

**Affected Products:**
- CBR750, running firmware versions prior to 4.6.3.6
- RBK752, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
- RBR750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
- RBS750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
- RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
- RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
- RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12

**Additional Information:**
- The advisory assigns a CVSS score of 9.6 (Critical).
- The CVSS vector is: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
- The document strongly recommends users update to the latest firmware versions.
