Based on the provided content, here's the vulnerability information:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** A null pointer dereference occurs in the `lsr_read_anim_values_ex()` function.
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The code attempts to dereference a null pointer, resulting in a segmentation fault.
*  **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability leads to a segmentation fault and application crash.
*   **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted file using the `MP4Box` tool. The provided command line argument `-bt` along with a malicious file will trigger the vulnerability. The file is an input to the `MP4Box` command, specifically a file that triggers the vulnerable `lsr_read_anim_values_ex()` function when parsed.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs the ability to provide the malicious file to the application. This can happen if the attacker can control the input file for the `MP4Box` tool.

The provided information gives a detailed analysis of the crash, including:
* The specific function and line where the crash occurs (lsr\_read\_anim\_values\_ex.part+1078)
* The register values and stack trace during the crash
* The specific version of GPAC that has the issue.
