Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from the way `GlobalProtect-openconnect` allowed users to specify arbitrary parameters to the `openconnect` command, including the `--script` option. This allowed any user to execute a custom script as root, because the `gpservice`, running as root, would execute `openconnect` with the parameters provided by the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Unrestricted Command Injection:** The primary vulnerability is the ability to inject arbitrary commands via the `--script` parameter of the `openconnect` command.
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privilege user can leverage this vulnerability to execute code as root.
- **Insecure Default Configuration:** The software allowed any user to control critical command-line arguments that should be restricted to administrative control.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary Code Execution:** Attackers can execute arbitrary code with root privileges.
- **System Compromise:** Full system compromise, including installation of rootkits, is possible.
- **Data Breach:** Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data stored on the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Command Injection:** The attacker leverages the `--script` parameter in `openconnect` to execute a custom script.
- **Local Exploitation:** The attacker needs to be a local user on the system.
- **DBus Activation:** The vulnerability could be triggered even if the systemd service was not running as it was using DBus activation.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be a user on the system where `GlobalProtect-openconnect` is installed. This includes even a low privileged "nobody" user.
- The attacker must be able to craft the `openconnect` command with a malicious `--script` parameter. This can be done using the UI.
- The attacker needs to have some basic knowledge of shell scripting.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability is described as "trivially exploitable."
- The fix involves moving the configuration to a root-owned configuration file (`/etc/gpservice/gp.conf`) and removing the ability for users to pass custom parameters to `openconnect`.
- The maintainer was advised to also disable the DBus activation of the `gpservice` to further improve security.
- The issue was fixed in version `1.4.3` of the software.
