Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The vulnerability lies in the `add_patient.php` file of the hospital management system. The code attempts to restrict access to logged-in users by redirecting unauthenticated users. However, the `exit()` function is not called after the redirection which causes the script execution to continue and allows an unauthorized user to add patient data.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Inadequate Access Control:** The system attempts to implement access control but fails to terminate script execution after redirection. This allows users who should be redirected to bypass authentication.
*   **Missing `exit()` After Redirection:** The critical missing piece is the absence of an `exit()` or `die()` statement after the `header("Location: login.php");` which would prevent the rest of the script from executing and allowing unauthorized access.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Unauthorized Data Modification:** An attacker can add patient data without being authenticated, leading to data integrity issues. They could potentially add fake or malicious data.
*   **Data Tampering:** The ability to add unauthorized data could have a negative impact on the integrity and reliability of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct HTTP Request:** An attacker can directly send an HTTP POST request to the `add_patient.php` script without any session or cookie, bypassing the intended login and authentication checks.
*   **Lack of Authentication Check:** The attack relies on the lack of proper authentication checks in the `add_patient.php` file, bypassing redirection attempts by continuing the script.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the web server hosting the hospital management system.
*   **No Prior Authentication:** The attacker doesn't need a valid account or be logged in to exploit this vulnerability.
