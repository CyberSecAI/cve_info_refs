## Installing KNIME Analytics Platform

|  | For step-by-step **videos** on how to install KNIME Analytics Platform, please take a look at our [KNIMETV YouTube channel](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLz3mQ6OlTI0ZXHcGJWPcf6_CqNLAiRh8J). |
| --- | --- |

1. Go to the [download page](https://www.knime.com/downloads) on the KNIME.com website to start installing KNIME Analytics Platform.
2. The download page shows three tabs which can be opened individually:

   * *Register for Help and Updates*: here you can optionally provide some personal information and sign up to our mailing list to receive the latest KNIME
     news
   * *Download KNIME*: this is where you can download the software
   * *Getting Started*: this tab gives you information and links about what you can do after you have installed KNIME Analytics Platform
3. Now open the *Download KNIME* tab and click the installation option that fits your operating system.
   KNIME Analytics Platform can be installed on Windows, Linux, or macOS.

   Notes on the different options for Windows:

   * The Windows installer extracts the compressed installation folder, adds an icon to your desktop, and suggests suitable memory settings.
   * The self-extracting archive simply creates a folder containing the KNIME installation files. You don’t need any software to manage archiving.
   * The zip archive can be downloaded, saved, and extracted in your preferred location on a system to which you have full access rights.

     ![010 install files](./img/010_install_files.png)

     Figure 1. KNIME Analytics Platform versions
4. Read and accept the privacy policy and terms and conditions. Then click *Download*.
5. Once downloaded, proceed with installing KNIME Analytics Platform:

   * *Windows:* Run the downloaded installer or self-extracting archive. If you have chosen to
     download the zip archive instead, unpack it to a location of your choice. Run `knime.exe` to start KNIME Analytics Platform.
   * *Linux:* Extract the downloaded tarball to a location of your choice. Run the `knime` executable to start KNIME Analytics Platform.
   * *Mac:* Double click the downloaded dmg file and wait for the verification to finish. Then move the KNIME icon to *Applications*.
     Double click the KNIME icon in the list of applications to launch KNIME Analytics Platform.

|  | Also check the [KNIME Getting Started Guide](https://www.knime.com/getting-started-guide) and the [KNIME Workbench Guide](../analytics_platform_workbench_guide/index.html). |
| --- | --- |

### Configuration settings and knime.ini file

When installing KNIME Analytics Platform, configuration settings are set to their defaults, and they can later be changed in the *knime.ini* file.
The configuration settings, i.e. options used by the Java Virtual Machine when KNIME Analytics Platform is launched, range from memory settings to system properties required by some extensions.

You can find `knime.ini` in the installation folder of KNIME Analytics Platform.

|  | **On MacOS**: To locate `knime.ini` on MacOS, open Finder and navigate to your installed Applications. Next, right click the KNIME application, select *Show Package Contents* in the menu, and navigate to `Contents` → `Eclipse`. |
| --- | --- |

The `knime.ini` file can be edited with any plaintext editor, such as Notepad (Windows), TextEdit (MacOS) or gedit (Linux).

### Allocating memory in knime.ini file

The entry `-Xmx1024m` in the `knime.ini` file specifies how much memory KNIME Analytics Platform is allowed to use.
The setting for this value will depend on how much memory is available in your machine.
KNIME recommends setting it to approximately one half of your available memory, but you can modify the value based on your needs.
For example, if your computer has 16 GB of memory, you might set the entry to `-Xmx8192m`.

## Installing Extensions and Integrations

If you want to add capabilities to KNIME Analytics Platform, you can install
extensions and integrations. The available extensions range from free open
source extensions and integrations provided by KNIME to free extensions
contributed by the community and commercial extensions including novel
technology nodes provided by our partners.

The KNIME extensions and integrations developed and maintained by KNIME contain
deep learning algorithms provided by Keras, high performance machine learning
provided by H2O, big data processing provided by Apache Spark, and scripting
provided by Python and R, just to mention a few.

Install extensions from:

* [KNIME Hub](https://hub.knime.com):

  + Search for the Extension or Integration you want to install in the search bar
  + Click Extensions on the results page
  + Click the extension you want to install, and from the extension page and drag
    and drop the squared yellow icon, shown in [Figure 2](#img-hub-extension-page),
    to the workbench of KNIME Analytics Platform. A window will open asking if
    you want to search and install the extension or integration.
    Click *Yes* and follow the instructions.

    ![02 hub extension page](./img/02_hub_extension_page.png)

    Figure 2. Install the KNIME Integrated Deployment Extension from KNIME Hub
  + Restart KNIME Analytics Platform.
* KNIME Analytics Platform:

  + Click *File* on the menu bar and then *Install KNIME Extensions…​*.
    The dialog shown in [Figure 3](#img-install-extension) opens.

## Updating KNIME Analytics Platform and Extensions

It is good to make sure that you always use the latest version of KNIME Analytics Platform and its extensions.

Do this by:

1. Clicking *File* → *Update KNIME…​*. In the dialog that opens, select the available updates you want to install
   and then click *Next*.
2. Proceed by following the instructions. KNIME Analytics Platform has to be restarted in order to apply the updates.

## Update Sites

The Update Sites are where KNIME retrieves additional software in the form of extensions as well as updates. To see or edit the available update sites, select *File* → *Preferences* → *Install/Update* → *Available Software Sites*.

### Default Update Sites

These four updates sites are provided by KNIME and are always available:

| 030 update site  Figure 5. Available Update Sites | | **KNIME Analytics Platform 4.5 Update Site**: Provides all extensions and integrations maintained by KNIME: R, Python, H2O Machine Learning, Apache Spark for big data, and many more. Contains KNIME Labs Extensions, which are extensions that are not yet part of the set of stable KNIME extensions because their functionality may not yet be finalized. | | --- | | **KNIME Community Extensions (Trusted)**: Provides trusted community extensions, i.e. extensions created by the KNIME community, which have been tested for backward compatibility and compliance with KNIME quality standards. | | **KNIME Partner Extensions**: Provides extensions created by KNIME partners. | | **Community Extensions (Experimental)**: Provides additional extensions created by the KNIME community. | |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

*KNIME Analytics Platform 4.5 Update Site* and *KNIME Community Extensions (Trusted)* are enabled by default.

### Adding External Update Sites

To install extensions that are not part of the above update sites, click *Add* to manually add the relevant update site, inserting the Name and Location as shown in [Figure 6](#add_update_site).

![030 add update site](./img/030_add_update_site.png)

Figure 6. Add Update Sites

After adding a new update site you will see it listed in the *Available Software Sites*. You must now enable it by selecting it from the list.

### Adding Local Update Sites

If your working environment has limited internet access or you receive an error
message âProxy Authentication Requiredâ when connecting to a remote update site
(provided by a URL), you can install extensions from a local zip file.

1. Download KNIME update sites as zip files at the following links:

   * [KNIME Analytics Platform Update Site](https://update.knime.org/analytics-platform/UpdateSite_latest45.zip)
   * [KNIME Community Extensions](https://www.knime.com/community)
   * [KNIME Partner Extensions](https://update.knime.com/partner/4.5/com.knime.update.partner_4.5.0.zip)
2. Save the zip file containing the extensions to your local system
3. Select *File* → *Preferences* → *Install/Update* → *Available Software Sites* and enter the path to the zip file by clicking *Add* → *Archive…​* as shown in [Figure 7](#img-add-zip-archive).

   ![040 add zip archive](./img/040_add_zip_archive.PNG)

   Figure 7. Adding Update Sites from Zip Archive

   |  | If the same extensions are provided by a URL, you will first have to disable the update site by disabling it in the list. |
   | --- | --- |
4. Now click *Apply and Close*

   |  | If the same extensions are also provided by a remote update site, you will first have to disable that update site by deselecting its entry in the *Available Software Sites* dialog and confirming via *Apply and Close*. |
   | --- | --- |

## Working with the Nightly Builds

Once a night, a new version of KNIME Analytics Platform is created directly from our development branch.
The Nightly Build versions available [here](https://www.knime.com/form/nightly-build) provide insight into what’s coming up in the next regular release.
However, for real work, always use a version of a standard KNIME release. Also read the following disclaimer before proceeding:

|  | **Really, really, *really* important disclaimer**   This is most definitely not production quality code. These nightly builds are what we use internally to validate and test recent developments, so they are not tested as thoroughly as standard KNIME releases. Furthermore new nodes or functionality may change substantially (or disappear entirely) from one build to the next. Itâs even possible that workflows you edit or create with nightly builds stop being readable by future (or past) versions…​   These nightlies are a great way to get a sneak peek at what may be coming in the next version of KNIME and provide feedback and suggestions. They are not a particularly safe way to do real work. |
