Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-45096:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability is due to the processing of XML files in KNIME Analytics Platform. Specifically, it involves an External XML Entity (XXE) injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **XXE Injection:** The application is susceptible to XXE injection when parsing workflow files (.knwf). This allows an attacker to include malicious external entities in the XML data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Information Disclosure:** By exploiting the XXE vulnerability, an attacker can force the application to initiate network connections to attacker-controlled servers.
*   **Sensitive Data Theft:** This connection can be used to extract sensitive information from the victim's machine, such as password hashes.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Workflow File:** The attack vector involves tricking a user into opening a specially crafted workflow file (.knwf).
*   **Network Connection:** The vulnerable application will then attempt to establish a network connection to an attacker-controlled server based on the crafted XML data.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Crafted Workflow File:** An attacker needs to create a malicious workflow file (.knwf) containing the XXE payload.
*   **Social Engineering:** The attacker needs to convince a victim to open the crafted workflow file.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is present in KNIME Analytics Platform version 4.4 and has been fixed in version 4.5.
*   The provided CVSS score is 4.7 (Medium) with a vector of `CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:N/A:N`
*   The vulnerability does not require any privileges for exploitation, however user interaction is needed to open a specially crafted workflow file.
*   The `knime.com` content provides a changelog entry indicating the fix for this vulnerability `AP-17730: External XML entity injection in workflow.knime files (CVE-2021-45096)`
