This document describes a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting certain NETGEAR routers.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a pre-authentication command injection. This means an attacker can inject malicious commands before authenticating to the router.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
The primary weakness is the lack of proper input sanitization or validation, allowing an attacker to inject OS commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can lead to a complete compromise of the affected router, including:
- Full control over the device
- Potential access to the internal network
- Data exfiltration
- Denial of service

**Attack Vectors:**
The vulnerability is pre-authentication, indicating that the attack can be performed over the network without needing prior credentials.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network or have network access to the vulnerable device. They do not need to have any authentication credentials.

**Affected Products:**
- XR300, firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.68
- R7000P, firmware versions prior to 1.3.3.140
- R6900P, firmware versions prior to 1.3.3.140

**CVSS Score:**
CVSS Rating: Critical
CVSS Score: 9.6
CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
