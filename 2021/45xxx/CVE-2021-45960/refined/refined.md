  "CVE-2021-45960": {
    "description": "In Expat (aka libexpat) before 2.4.3, a left shift by 29 (or more) places in the storeAtts function in xmlparse.c can lead to realloc misbehavior (e.g., allocating too few bytes, or only freeing memory).",
    "vulnerability_details": {
      "root_cause": "A left shift operation by 29 or more bits in the `storeAtts` function within `xmlparse.c` leads to an integer overflow, resulting in incorrect memory allocation by `realloc`.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Integer overflow",
        "Incorrect memory allocation",
        "Use of signed integer in bit shift operation"
      ],
      "impact": "Denial of service or potentially more due to memory corruption.",
      "attack_vectors": "Processing of a specially crafted XML document with a large number of prefixed attributes on a single tag.",
      "attacker_capabilities": "Attacker needs to provide a malformed XML file to the vulnerable parser. Low privilege is sufficient."
    },
    "affected_components": [
        "Expat (aka libexpat) versions prior to 2.4.3",

          "Siemens SINEMA Remote Connect Server"
    ],
    "additional_notes": "The vulnerability is triggered by a tag containing a large number of prefixed XML attributes. The vulnerability can lead to different behaviors depending on system architecture (32 bit vs 64 bit).  On 32-bit systems, the overflow can lead to allocation of too few bytes or `realloc` acting as a free operation, while on both 32 bit and 64 bit systems, a left shift of >= 31 bits results in undefined behavior.  Exploiting this remotely may be limited by file upload size restrictions."
