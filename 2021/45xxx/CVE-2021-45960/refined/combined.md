Subject: Expat 2.4.3 released, includes 8 security fixes

 From <https://blog.hartwork.org/posts/expat-2-4-3-released/> :

> libexpat is a fast streaming XML parser. Alongside libxml2, Expat is one of the most widely used software libre XML parsers written in C, precisely C99. It is cross-platform and licensed under the MIT license.
>
> Expat 2.4.3 has been released earlier today. Besides two minor fixes to the build system, this release is about security fixes. There is a total of 8 CVEs fixed, all related to fixed-size integer math (integer overflow and invalid shifts) near memory allocation. Impact is denial of service, or more.

Debian Bug     : 1002994 1003474

Several vulnerabilities have been discovered in Expat, an XML parsing C
library, which could result in denial of service or potentially the
execution of arbitrary code, if a malformed XML file is processed.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), these problems have been fixed
in version 2.2.6-2+deb10u2.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), these problems have been fixed in
version 2.2.10-2+deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your expat packages.

For the detailed security status of expat please refer to its security
tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/expat>

these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

Doesn't sound easy to exploit, so I'll mark it sec-low. Only 91 is really affected from a sec perspective due to RLBox, but we should fix it on Nightly at least.

Does it make more sense to move status-firefox97 to disabled due to RLBox, too?

I think I meant to mark it wontfix, not disabled.

# [R1] Nessus Versions 8.15.3 and 10.1.1 Fix Multiple Third-Party Vulnerabilities

Critical

[← View More Security Advisories](/security)
### Synopsis

Nessus leverages third-party software to help provide underlying functionality. One of the third-party components (Expat) was found to contain vulnerabilities, and an updated version has been made available by the provider.

Out of caution and in line with best practice, Tenable has opted to upgrade the Expat component to address the potential impact of the issue. Nessus 10.1.1 and Nessus 8.15.3 update Expat to version 2.4.4 to address the identified vulnerability.

### Solution

Tenable has released Nessus 10.1.1 and Nessus 8.15.3 to address these issues. The installation files can be obtained from the Tenable Downloads Portal (https://www.tenable.com/downloads/nessus).

| [@kraptor](https://github.com/kraptor) in a few days, followed by release 2.4.3 There is more security work upcoming for 2.4.3; I personally recommend waiting for release 2.4.3, and then acting on all vulnerabilities at once. |

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SINEMA Remote Connect is a management platform for remote networks that enables the simple
management of tunnel connections (VPN) between headquarters, service technicians, and installed
machines or plants. It provides both the Remote Connect Server, which is the server application, and the
Remote Connect Client, which is an OpenVPN client for optimal connection to SINEMA Remote Connect
Server.

VULNERABILITY DESCRIPTION

This chapter describes all vulnerabilities (CVE-IDs) addressed in this security advisory. Wherever
applicable, it also documents the product-specific impact of the individual vulnerabilities.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22924

libcurl keeps previously used connections in a connection pool for subsequent transfers to reuse, if
one of them matches the setup. Due to errors in the logic, the config matching function did not take
‘issuercert’ into account and it compared the involved paths case insensitively, which could lead to
libcurl reusing wrong connections. File paths are, or can be, case sensitive on many systems but not all,
and can even vary depending on used file systems. The comparison also didn’t include the ‘issuer cert’
which a transfer can set to qualify how to verify the server certificate.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-22925

curl supports the -t command line option, known as CURLOPT_TELNETOPTIONS in libcurl. This rarely
used option is used to send variable=content pairs to TELNET servers. Due to flaw in the option parser
for sending NEW_ENV variables, libcurl could be made to pass on uninitialized data from a stack based
buffer to the server. Therefore potentially revealing sensitive internal information to the server using
a clear-text network protocol. This could happen because curl did not call and use sscanf() correctly
when parsing the string provided by the application.

| Back in 2015, Tyson Smith ([@tysmith](https://github.com/tysmith)) [reported](https://bugzilla.mozilla.org/show_bug.cgi?id=1217609) invalid left shifts at 5 places in libexpat to Mozilla. 3 of these bad shifts had also been [reported](https://sourceforge.net/p/expat/bugs/529/) by Dingbao Xie ([@xiedingbao](https://github.com/xiedingbao)), and been fixed in commit [2106ee4](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/commit/2106ee4050fd0d30e776e1c5a48937bb76a17074) and release 2.2.0 in 2016; this ticket is meant to explain my evaluation of those 2 remaining bad shifts, as a reference, for anyone interested, and to allow review and correction as needed.  For short, there is security issue in libexpat that affects even the oldest releases, >=1.95.7 at least (commit [b288698](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/commit/b28869898a5bc870e620edce09a5e65b4d556ba7)). Probably not one to panic about.  The [related code](https://github.com/libexpat/libexpat/blob/60bbbe560cb50e6bfbf93ed765aaeb38335487c3/expat/lib/xmlparse.c#L3417-L3430) in function `storeAtts` in `lib/xmlparse.c` is this:  ``` int nsAttsSize = (int)1 << parser->m_nsAttsPower; [..] nsAttsSize = (int)1 << parser->m_nsAttsPower; [..] temp = (NS_ATT *)REALLOC(parser, parser->m_nsAtts,                          nsAttsSize * sizeof(NS_ATT)); ```  It should be noted that:   * The related code is triggered by XML documents that contain tags with prefixed attributes (e.g. `<r xmlns:a="[..]" a:a123="[..]" [..] />`. * The `(int)` cast doesn't do anything, `1` is `int` by default. * A left shift on signed int by >=31 bits is undefined behavior for `sizeof(int)==4`. * For the multiplication in `nsAttsSize * sizeof(NS_ATT)`:   + `sizeof` returns a `size_t`, unsigned and larger or equal to `int` in size, depending on machine architecture.   + signed `nsAttsSize` is promoted to unsigned(!) `size_t` in context of that multiplication. * The value of `m_nsAttsPower` is derived from the number of prefixed attributes in the tag. If we include the namespace declaration attribute in that number, the math is `atts_power := int(math.log2(atts_count - 1)) + 2` (thinking Python). So to see `m_nsAttsPower` value 29 in memory, we need 2^(29-2)+1 prefixed XML attributes.   From here on, behavior of the code depends on the machine architecture, in particular the sizes of types `int` and `size_t`; so we get different behavior on e.g. 32bit x86 than on 64bit amd64. In detail:  ```                   |  x86 (32bit int and size_t)        |  amd64 (32bit int, 64bit size_t) ------------------+------------------------------------+--------------------------------- m_nsAttsPower 29  |  (size_t)(1 << 29) * (4+4+4)       |  (size_t)(1 << 29) * (8+8+8)                   |  => 2_147_483_648, mult overflow   |  >= 12_884_901_888                   |  => allocating too few bytes       |  => mallocs okay or returns NULL                   |                                    | m_nsAttsPower 30  |  (size_t)(1 << 30) * (4+4+4)       |  (size_t)(1 << 30) * (8+8+8)                   |  => 0, mult overflow               |  => 25_769_803_776                   |  => realloc acts as free           |  => mallocs okay or returns NULL                   |                                    | m_nsAttsPower 31  |  (size_t)(1 << 31) * (4+4+4)       |  (size_t)(1 << 31) * (8+8+8)                   |  => undefined behavior             |  => undefined behavior                   |                                    |  ```  To summarize the problem,   * `m_nsAttsPower<=28` is fine on both platforms. * `m_nsAttsPower==29` will allocate too few bytes on 32bit, fine on 64bit. * `m_nsAttsPower==30` makes realloc act like free on 32bit, fine on 64bit. * `m_nsAttsPower>=31` is undefined behavior is denial of service (or more) on both platforms.   The fix will have these parts:   * First, detect and prevent left shifts by `sizeof(int) * 8 - 1` or more bits. * Second, detect and prevent integer overflow on `nsAttsSize * sizeof(NS_ATT)`. * (Third, turn `int` into `unsigned int` to make the code more clear, close the door to undefined behavior, and allow even `1u << 31`.)   A pull request and likely a CVE are upcoming, and there will be a soon release 2.4.3.  Because thy payload to trigger the vulnerability is in the gigabytes, *remote* exploitability will hopefully be stopped by upload limits in most setups, before even getting to libexpat. Even when generating attribute names using the base58 scheme for short non-overlapping names, an XML file with e.g. 2^29+1 attributes on a single tag is ~6.5 GiB in size. I have a Python >=3.6 script to create XML files like that online at <https://gist.github.com/hartwork/ccad94d00c4193e05ab57de70021e6ee>.  Best, Sebastian |

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.
