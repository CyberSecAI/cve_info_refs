Root cause of vulnerability:
The "rollback" feature (`action=rollback`) in MediaWiki could be exploited by passing a specially crafted parameter. This allowed an attacker to view the contents of arbitrary pages, regardless of whether they had permissions to do so. The vulnerability exists because the 'from' parameter was parsed as full wikitext and transcluded the private page, bypassing permission checks.

Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:
- Improper input validation of the 'from' parameter in the rollback action.
- Insufficient permission checks within the rollback functionality when handling transcluded content.

Impact of exploitation:
- Unauthorized users could access the content of private wiki pages. This is a significant information leak vulnerability, especially for wikis intended to be private or have access restrictions.

Attack vectors:
- The vulnerability is triggered by crafting a specific URL with the `action=rollback` parameter and using a `from` parameter which contains a reference to the private page in wikitext format (e.g., `from={{:private page}}`).

Required attacker capabilities/position:
- An attacker does not need to be a logged-in user to exploit this vulnerability on wikis where public access is allowed for some pages via `$wgWhitelistRead`.
- The attacker needs to have knowledge of a private page's title and construct the malicious URL to exploit this vulnerability.
