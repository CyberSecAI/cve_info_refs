Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45029:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the lack of input sanitization or filtering before processing user-provided expressions. Apache ShenYu allows users to define conditions within Selectors and Rules using "regEx like contain SpEL Groovy". The system directly parses these expressions using `parseExpression` and `Eval.me` without proper validation, which allows the injection of malicious Groovy and SpEL code.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Groovy Code Injection:** The system directly evaluates user-controlled Groovy code, which allows an attacker to execute arbitrary code on the server.
- **SpEL Injection:** Similar to Groovy, user-provided SpEL (Spring Expression Language) expressions are directly parsed and evaluated, which allows for remote code execution.
- **Lack of Input Sanitization:** The core weakness is that user input is not sanitized or filtered before being processed as code.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** Successfully exploiting this vulnerability allows attackers to execute arbitrary code on the server where Apache ShenYu is running, potentially compromising the entire system and network.
- **Full System Compromise:** Attackers could gain complete control over the affected server, enabling them to steal data, install malware, or disrupt operations.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Configuration through Selectors and Rules:** Attackers can inject malicious Groovy or SpEL code by manipulating the configuration of Selectors and Rules within Apache ShenYu, specifically in the "match = regEx like contain SpEL Groovy" conditions.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to Configuration:** An attacker needs the ability to configure or modify the Selectors and Rules within the Apache ShenYu system to inject the malicious code.
- **Understanding of Groovy/SpEL:** Attackers need knowledge of Groovy or SpEL to craft the malicious expressions that will be executed.

**Affected Versions:**
- Apache ShenYu 2.4.0
- Apache ShenYu 2.4.1

**Mitigation:**
- Upgrade to Apache ShenYu 2.4.2 or later.
- Apply the patch provided in the GitHub pull request: <https://github.com/apache/incubator-shenyu/pull/2576>
