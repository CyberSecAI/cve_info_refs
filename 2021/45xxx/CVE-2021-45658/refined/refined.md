The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR, which describes a server-side injection vulnerability affecting multiple router, extender, and WiFi system models. Although the advisory does not have an associated CVE ID it is still relevant to the query.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Server-side injection vulnerability

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Server-side injection

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The advisory does not specify the exact impact but server-side injection can lead to Remote Code Execution (RCE), information disclosure and other malicious actions. The CVSS score of 7.1 indicates high impact potential.

**Attack vectors:**
- The advisory does not detail the attack vector, but server-side injections typically involve manipulating user-controlled inputs that are then processed on the server. Given the affected devices are network devices, the attack is likely performed over a network connection.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The CVSS vector specifies "Local access", "Low privileges" and "No user interaction". This suggests that an attacker, even with local low privileges could exploit the vulnerability without any user interaction. This seems unlikely, unless the attacker already compromised some other system component. More likely the CVSS is incorrect, which is a common problem in advisories.
