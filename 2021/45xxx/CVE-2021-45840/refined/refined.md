The provided content is related to CVE-2021-45840.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The root cause is a combination of multiple vulnerabilities, including:

1.  **Custom PHP extension:** The Terramaster NAS uses a custom PHP extension (`php_terra_master.so`) to decrypt certain PHP files. This extension contains a hardcoded passphrase ("GH65Hws2jedf3fl3MeK") used in the decryption process.

2.  **RCE via command injection:** Several PHP scripts contain vulnerabilities that allow for remote command execution (RCE). User-controlled input is passed to `shell_exec()` or `system()` functions without proper sanitization, enabling command injection.

3.  **Session crafting via insecure cookie handling:** The application uses cookies (`kod_name` and `kod_token`) for session management. The `kod_token` is generated using the MAC address and the user's password hash. The application also stores the admin's password hash which can be retrieved through an API endpoint. This allows attackers to craft valid session cookies and bypass authentication.

4.  **Information disclosure:** The MAC address can be obtained through API endpoints, and the application's API endpoint `/module/api.php?mobile/wapNasIPS` discloses user password hashes.

5.  **Arbitrary file download:** The API endpoint `/module/api.php?mobile/fileDownload` allows a user to download any file from the NAS by providing its full path, even as a guest user.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   Hardcoded cryptographic key
*   Command injection vulnerabilities
*   Insecure session management
*   Information disclosure
*   Arbitrary file download

**Impact of exploitation:**

Successful exploitation allows an unauthenticated attacker to:

*   Gain remote code execution as root
*   Access sensitive information
*   Potentially take complete control of the affected NAS device

**Attack vectors:**

*   HTTP requests to vulnerable PHP scripts
*   Crafted session cookies
*   Abuse of API endpoints

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Terramaster NAS.
*   No prior authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability chain.
