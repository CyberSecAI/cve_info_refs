Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45705:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `TlsWyRand`'s implementation of the `Deref` trait in the `nanorand` crate. It unconditionally dereferences a raw pointer, leading to the creation of multiple mutable references to the same memory location.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Aliasing of mutable references:** The core issue is the creation of multiple mutable references to the same data. In Rust, this is considered undefined behavior because it violates the language's memory safety guarantees, as multiple mutable references can lead to data races and unpredictable behavior.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Undefined behavior:** Exploiting this vulnerability leads to undefined behavior, which can range from unexpected program crashes, data corruption, or arbitrary code execution, depending on compiler optimizations and how the program utilizes the affected code.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is present within the `nanorand::tls::tls_rand` function and affects the `TlsWyRand` struct. Any code that utilizes this function or the `TlsWyRand` struct within the affected version range is susceptible. This is a local, in-process vulnerability, but the impact can extend to systems where vulnerable libraries are used.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to use a vulnerable version of the `nanorand` crate (versions 0.5.0 to 0.6.0 inclusive). The attacker would not need elevated privileges or remote access, but would need to control the software or code which is built with the vulnerable crate.

**Additional Notes:**
- The issue is resolved in `nanorand` versions >= 0.6.1.
- The vulnerability is specific to the `TlsWyRand` struct and how its `Deref` implementation dereferences raw pointers.
- The advisory highlights the memory safety and aliasing issues.
