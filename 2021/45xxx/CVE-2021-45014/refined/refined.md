The provided content describes a SQL injection vulnerability in the taocms project.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability lies in the `update()` method within the `Cms.php` file, specifically at line 59. The `id` parameter is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query. Specifically, the code does not use `intval` to process the `id`.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL injection vulnerability. The lack of sanitization on the `id` parameter allows an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.
- Blind SQL injection is specifically mentioned, indicating the attacker might need to infer the output.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can potentially manipulate database queries, leading to unauthorized data access, modification, or deletion.
- The attacker could potentially gain full access to the database.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the `id` parameter in the URL when updating an article.
- Specifically, the reported vulnerable URL parameter is `action=cms&ctrl=update&id=26`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be authenticated to the administrative panel of the application.
- The attacker needs to be able to access the "Management article" feature where an `id` parameter can be manipulated.
- The attacker needs the ability to craft a malicious `id` value to exploit the vulnerability.
- Knowledge of SQL injection techniques is necessary to exploit this vulnerability.
