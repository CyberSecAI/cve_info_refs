  "cve": "CVE-2021-45485",
  "description": "The Linux kernel has a vulnerability related to the generation of IPv6 ID which may lead to information leakage.",
  "affected_versions": {
    "linux": "All versions before 5.14-rc1, and backported to kernel versions 5.13.3, 5.12.18, 5.10.51, 5.4.133, 4.19.198, 4.14.240, 4.9.276 and 4.4.276."
  },
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The IPv6 ID generation algorithm in the Linux kernel used a predictable algorithm similar to the IPv4 ID algorithm, making it vulnerable to information leakage.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Predictable IPv6 ID generation algorithm"
    ],
    "impact": "Information leakage by observing the generated IPv6 ID values, which could lead to covert channel attacks.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Network-based attacks",
	  "Attacker sends network packets to observe the predictable IPv6 ID values"
    ],
    "required_capabilities": "An attacker capable of sending network packets and observing responses can potentially mount an attack."
  },

    "https://cdn.kernel.org/pub/linux/kernel/v5.x/ChangeLog-5.13.3"
  ],
    "remediation": "The Linux kernel has been patched to replace the existing IPv6 ID algorithm with a completely randomized IPv6 ID. Affected systems should be updated to kernel version 5.14-rc1 or later, or to a backported version.",
	"additional_information": "The provided content from arxiv.org describes an information leakage technique based on the statefulness of IPv6 flow label. Though not directly related to CVE-2021-45485 which is about IPv6 ID, it is related to network information leakage."
