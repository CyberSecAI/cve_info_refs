The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a post-authentication buffer overflow vulnerability, which is not associated with the specified CVE. The document refers to the vulnerability as "PSV-2018-0418" and provides details about affected product models and firmware versions along with remediation steps.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication buffer overflow

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** A buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the affected firmware versions. The overflow occurs after successful authentication, which suggests it may involve processing data after a user has logged into the device.

**Impact of exploitation:** The exploitation of this vulnerability can lead to a denial-of-service (DoS) condition, as indicated by the CVSS score with a high impact on availability. The document explicitly mentions "buffer overflow" but not any other impacts besides DoS.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent network (AV:A). This suggests that an attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be authenticated (PR:L - low privileges) to exploit the vulnerability, which means the attacker needs to have valid credentials for the device. No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**CVSS Score:**
* CVSS Rating: Medium
* CVSS Score: 5.7
* CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.0/AV:A/AC:L/PR:L/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H

**Affected product models and firmware:**
* R7000 running firmware versions prior to 1.0.9.42

**Mitigation:**
* Update firmware to version 1.0.9.42 or later
