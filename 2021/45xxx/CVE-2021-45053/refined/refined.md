Based on the provided document, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-45053:

**Root Cause:** Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)

**Vulnerability:**
- An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in Adobe InCopy. This means the software writes data beyond the allocated memory buffer.

**Impact:**
- Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution. An attacker can potentially execute malicious code on the user's system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is local (AV:L). This indicates the attacker needs to have local access to the affected system.
- Low attack complexity (AC:L) suggests the vulnerability is easy to exploit.
- No privileges are required (PR:N), meaning an attacker without any special user rights can trigger the vulnerability.
- User interaction is required (UI:R). The user needs to perform some action, like opening a specially crafted file, to trigger the vulnerability.
- The scope is unchanged (S:U), meaning the vulnerability will affect the application that has the vulnerability.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
- An attacker needs to have local access to the system and be able to entice the user to interact with a malicious file, or take other action to trigger the vulnerability.
- The attacker does not need any special privileges.
