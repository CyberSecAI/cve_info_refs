Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:** Post-authentication command injection vulnerability

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability allows for command injection after successful authentication to the affected NETGEAR devices.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to the attacker executing arbitrary commands on the affected devices. This can lead to full compromise of the devices and the connected network.
- The provided CVSS vector indicates a high impact on Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is Adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker requires high privileges (PR:H), meaning they need to have already authenticated to the device with administrative rights before exploiting the vulnerability.
- The user interaction is None (UI:N) - the attack can be performed without any interaction from a user on the device.

**Affected Products and Versions:**
The following NETGEAR product models with firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6 are affected:
- RBK752
- RBR750
- RBS750
- RBK852
- RBR850
- RBS850

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory does not explicitly detail the vulnerable component or how the command injection is performed.
- The vulnerability is identified as PSV-2020-0086 within NETGEAR's internal security tracking, but it does not have an associated CVE ID.
-  The provided CVSS score is 8.4, categorized as a Medium severity issue by NETGEAR. This seems contradictory to the provided vector, which indicates a high severity.
