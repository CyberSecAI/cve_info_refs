Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45467:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a flawed input validation in the `GETSecurity` function within the `/user/loader.php` file of the CWP (CentOS Web Panel). This function attempts to prevent directory traversal by checking for the presence of ".." in the input. However, it fails to properly handle null bytes (%00) within the input string.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **File Inclusion:** The primary vulnerability is a file inclusion flaw. By manipulating the `scripts` parameter in `/user/loader.php` with a crafted payload, specifically using null bytes (`%00`) in conjunction with dot characters (`.`), an attacker can bypass the intended directory traversal protection and include arbitrary files from the server's file system.
*   **Insufficient Input Sanitization:** The `GETSecurity` function's use of `stristr()` which is case-insensitive and fails to sanitize or filter null bytes before performing a check allows the bypass.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Pre-authentication Remote Code Execution (RCE):** When combined with another vulnerability (CVE-2021-45466), this file inclusion flaw allows an attacker to achieve pre-authentication remote code execution as root. This is because the file inclusion vulnerability can be used to execute the content of a file on the server.
*   **Arbitrary File Access/Manipulation**: The vulnerability provides the ability to read and potentially execute the content of any file on the server. This gives an attacker complete control of the server.
*   **API Key Manipulation:** This specific vulnerability could be used to bypass authentication and create a malicious API key, gaining access to the CWP's API.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is a crafted HTTP GET request to the `/user/loader.php` endpoint.
*   **Malicious Parameter:** The vulnerable parameter is `scripts` within the GET request.
*   **Exploitation Payload:** A payload like `/.%00./` or `.%00%00%00./.%00%00%00./`  bypasses the check using the null byte and allowing traversal to other server directories.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the CWP server to send the malicious HTTP request.
*   **No Authentication Required:** The vulnerability is pre-authentication, meaning an attacker does not need valid credentials to exploit it.
*   **Knowledge of Vulnerability:** The attacker needs knowledge of the vulnerability and how to craft the exploit payload to bypass the check using null bytes.

**Additional Details (from the content, not in CVE description):**

*   The blog post explains the research process of how the vulnerability was discovered by fuzzing and identifying a bypass to the `stristr()` function using null bytes.
*   The post also explains the full vulnerability chain, which uses the file inclusion vulnerability (CVE-2021-45467) and a file write vulnerability (CVE-2021-45466) to achieve preauth RCE.
*   The patch for this vulnerability included the addition of a check for `.00%` within the `GETSecurity` function.
*   A bypass using multiple null bytes was found.
