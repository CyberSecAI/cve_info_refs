The provided content is related to a post-authentication command injection vulnerability in NETGEAR Orbi products, identified by the internal ID PSV-2020-0175, though not directly linked to CVE-2021-45593.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The root cause is a post-authentication command injection vulnerability within the firmware of the affected NETGEAR Orbi products.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
The vulnerability allows for command injection after a user successfully authenticates to the device. This implies that user-provided data is not properly sanitized before being used in system commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This could lead to:
  - Full control over the device.
  - Data exfiltration.
  - Denial of service.
  - Further attacks on the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
The attack vector is through the web interface or other management interfaces of the affected NETGEAR Orbi devices after successful user authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
An attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the web interface or other management interfaces of the affected device to exploit this vulnerability. This suggests a threat model where a malicious insider or an attacker who has gained access to administrative credentials can leverage this vulnerability.
