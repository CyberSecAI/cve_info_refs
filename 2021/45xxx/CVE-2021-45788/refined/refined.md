The provided content describes a time-based SQL injection vulnerability in MeterSphere version 1.15.4.

- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization of user-controlled parameters in the `order by` clause of SQL queries within the `ExtTestPlanTestCaseMapper.xml` file. Specifically, the `name` and `type` parameters within the `orders` parameter in the API request are directly incorporated into the SQL query without proper validation.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct use of user-supplied input within the SQL query's `ORDER BY` clause.
    - Time-Based SQL Injection: The vulnerability is exploitable as a time-based SQL injection, where the attacker can inject SQL queries with `sleep()` functions to cause delays and confirm injection.

- **Impact of exploitation:**
    - Sensitive Data Exposure: An attacker could potentially extract sensitive information from the database by crafting malicious SQL queries.
    - Data Modification: Although not explicitly demonstrated here, an attacker might also be able to modify or delete data in the database.
    - Denial of Service (DoS): Exploitation could lead to DoS scenarios by injecting queries that consume excessive resources.

- **Attack vectors:**
    - The attack vector is through the API endpoint `/test/case/list/{goPage}/{pageSize}` or similar APIs like `/test/plan/case/list/all`, `/test/plan/case/list/ids`, and `/issues/list/{goPage}/{pageSize}`.
    - The attacker controls the `orders` parameter in the request body, specifically the `name` and `type` values of each order in the array.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:**
    - The attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
    - The attacker needs to be able to send API requests to the vulnerable endpoints.
