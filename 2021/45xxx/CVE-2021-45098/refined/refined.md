Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from the way Suricata handles TCP RST packets that contain either the TCP MD5 option (RFC 2385) or the TCP Authentication Option (TCP-AO, RFC 5925).
- Suricata cannot validate these options because the necessary key/password for the hash is communicated out-of-band and not available within the network traffic.
- An attacker can exploit this by injecting a crafted TCP RST packet with a forged MD5 or AO header.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**

- **Lack of proper RST validation:** Suricata does not have the necessary information to validate the MD5 or AO options in RST packets. This makes it vulnerable to spoofed RST packets.
- **TCP State Desynchronization:** A forged RST packet with MD5/AO options can potentially move the TCP session state to 'CLOSED' on the Suricata side while the actual TCP session remains active from other host perspectives (e.g. the server still sends data after the forged RST).
- **Bypass of Payload Detection:** By desynchronizing the TCP state in Suricata, attackers can send malicious payloads that would otherwise be detected by Suricata's rules.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Evasion of Security Rules:** Attackers can bypass Suricata's intrusion detection and prevention mechanisms, allowing them to potentially inject malicious traffic without detection.
- **Data Injection**: By exploiting the desynchronization of TCP sessions, an attacker can inject malicious data to a server that is not detected by Suricata.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Forged TCP RST Packets:** Attackers inject a TCP RST packet containing either TCP MD5 or TCP AO options.
- **Man-in-the-Middle:** An attacker in a position to intercept and inject packets can perform the attack.
- The injected TCP RST with MD5/AO options is sent from the client side.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to inject packets into the network traffic flow that is being monitored by Suricata.
- **Packet Crafting:** The attacker needs the ability to forge TCP packets including the MD5 or AO options.
- **Understanding of TCP:** A solid understanding of TCP behavior, including the three-way handshake and RST handling, is necessary.

**Additional Details from the provided content:**

- The vulnerability affects both Suricata versions 6.0.3 and 7.0.0-dev (as of September 2021).
- The fix involves flagging the receiver as having received an RST and moving the TCP state to the closed state.
- If the sender continues to send data, the TCP state is reverted, and a "stream-event: suspected_rst_inject" event is generated.
- The issue is tracked as Security #4710 in Suricata's Redmine.
- The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-45098.
- The provided files demonstrate the issue with a test rule and PCAP files, and a python script to reproduce the vulnerability.
- The vulnerability can be exploited using both TCP MD5 and TCP-AO header options.
- The fix was implemented in commit 50e2b973eeec7172991bf8f544ab06fb782b97df.
