# HTCONDOR-2021-0004 [CVE-2021-45102](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45102)

---

| Summary: |  |
| --- | --- |
| When authenticating to an HTCondor daemon using a SciToken, a user may be granted authorizations beyond what the token should allow. | |
| | Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available | | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | | All daemons | 9.0.0 and above | All | Not known to be publicly exploited | 9.0.3, 9.1.1 | | Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences | | Verified | Possession of a certain type of SciToken | Any | Low | Medium | | Fixed Date | Credit | | 2021-07-27 | Jeny Teheran | | |
| Access Required: | Possession of a certain type of SciToken |
| An attacker needs to have a SciToken with certain attributes that HTCondor will interpret as having more capabilities than it should. | |
| Effort Required: | Low |
| These types of tokens required to exploit this vulnerability can be obtained using standard methods and do not require custom tools or modifications to the token. | |
| Impact/Consequences: | High |
| Exploiting this vulnerability could allow a user to perform actions that they should not be allowed to do, such as submitting a job. | |
| Workaround: |
| You can work around this issue by not allowing SciTokens as an authentication method. This means overriding the list of authentication methods (which includes SciTokens by default) by setting SEC\_DEFAULT\_AUTHENTICATION\_METHODS to all the methods you would actually like to use. To simply remove SciTokens, set it to "FS,TOKEN,KERBEROS,GSI,SSL". | |
| Full Details: | Embargoed until future notice. |
