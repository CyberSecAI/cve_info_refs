Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45452:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability stems from insufficient sanitization of filenames passed to the `Storage.save()` function in Django. Specifically, the function did not properly handle directory traversal sequences in filenames, like `../`, allowing an attacker to potentially save a file outside of the intended directory.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- **Directory Traversal:** The core issue is the possibility of writing files to arbitrary locations by manipulating file paths. This can lead to overwriting system files or placing malicious files in unexpected locations.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Arbitrary file write:** An attacker could potentially overwrite existing files or create new ones outside the intended upload directory. 
- **Code Execution:** In specific cases, an attacker could place malicious code (e.g. a web shell) in a location where the server will execute it, leading to a complete compromise of the server.

**Attack vectors:**

- **File upload:** The primary attack vector is through file uploads or other file-saving mechanisms where the filename is passed to `Storage.save()`. 
- **Direct manipulation:** If an application directly uses the storage API and accepts filenames from untrusted sources, it could also be vulnerable.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to upload files or manipulate storage paths:** The attacker needs a way to control the filename argument provided to `Storage.save()`. This usually implies some write privileges in the application itself.
- **Knowledge of target file structure:** To effectively leverage the directory traversal, an attacker must know the target file structure to place the malicious file in the correct location.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided documents indicate that Django versions 2.2, 3.2, and 4.0 were affected and have been patched.
- This vulnerability is classified as "low" severity according to Django security policy but can result in a severe impact.
- NetApp products were not affected.
