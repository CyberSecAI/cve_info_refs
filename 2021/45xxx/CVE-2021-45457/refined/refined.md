Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-45457:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from an overly broad Cross-Origin Resource Sharing (CORS) configuration in Apache Kylin. Specifically, the server reflects the `Origin` header in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response header, allowing any origin to make cross-origin requests.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure CORS Configuration:** The server dynamically reflects the `Origin` header value in the `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` response, effectively allowing any website to make cross-origin requests to the Kylin API. This bypasses the intended security of the CORS policy.
*   **Credentials Allowed Cross-Origin:** The server also sends the `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials: true` header, which means that cookies, authorization headers, and TLS client certificates can be included in cross-origin requests. This combined with the overly permissive `Access-Control-Allow-Origin` opens up a significant security hole.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Data Exposure/Manipulation:** An attacker can potentially make cross-origin requests from a malicious website to a vulnerable Kylin instance. If the user has an active Kylin session, the attacker can potentially perform any actions the user is authorized to do. This could include accessing sensitive data, modifying configurations, or even performing administrative tasks on the Kylin platform.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Cross-Site Request:** The attacker would need to trick a user into visiting a malicious webpage or injecting a malicious script into a trusted webpage. This malicious webpage would then make requests to the vulnerable Kylin instance using the logged in users session.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **User Interaction:** The attacker needs a user with an active Kylin session to visit a malicious website or have the attacker inject malicious content into a website the victim visits.
*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable Kylin instance.
*   **Knowledge of API:** The attacker also needs knowledge of the Kylin API to construct the requests to achieve the desired outcome.

**Affected Versions:**

*   Apache Kylin 2.x versions up to and including 2.6.6
*   Apache Kylin 3.x versions up to and including 3.1.2
*   Apache Kylin 4.x versions up to and including 4.0.0

**Mitigation:**

*   Upgrade to Apache Kylin 3.1.3 (for 2.x and 3.x users) or apply patch <https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1782>
*   Upgrade to Apache Kylin 4.0.1 (for 4.x users) or apply patch <https://github.com/apache/kylin/pull/1781>
