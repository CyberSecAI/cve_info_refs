{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the lack of CSRF protection on GET requests that perform state-changing actions within the Gitea application. Some GET routes in Gitea were performing actions that modified the system state (e.g., user logout). The existing CSRF protection only covered POST requests, leaving these GET routes vulnerable.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "CSRF vulnerability on GET routes performing state-changing actions",
        "Insufficient CSRF protection on API routes",
        "Reliance on cookie-based authentication without proper token enforcement for API requests"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker could potentially exploit this vulnerability by crafting a malicious link or embedding a script on an external site. When a victim clicks this link or visits the malicious site, the browser will automatically send the victim's cookies along with the GET request to the vulnerable Gitea route. This allows the attacker to perform unauthorized state-changing actions on the victim's behalf, including deletion of private code and data theft.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "Crafted malicious links",
        "Embedded scripts on external websites",
        "Cross-site GET requests exploiting browser behavior of automatically sending cookies"
    ],
    "required_attacker_capabilities": [
      "Ability to create malicious links or embed scripts on external websites.",
         "Knowledge of vulnerable Gitea GET routes performing state-changing actions",
        "Ability to entice the victim to access the malicious resource while logged into Gitea."
      ]
  },
  "fixes": [
    "Enforced token validation on API routes using the reqToken handler",
    "Implemented a separate token for vulnerable GET routes",
    "Modified the go-macaron/csrf module to include token validation for GET requests",
      "Changed some vulnerable GET routes to POST routes"
  ],
  "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was initially reported through a security researcher (cezar97) and highlighted the risk of state-changing GET routes.  The fix involved a combination of changes to require authentication tokens for API access and implementation of CSRF protection on specific GET routes that perform actions.  The fix was implemented in PR #4840 and backported to release/v1.5. Issue #4357 refers to a related, but distinct, vulnerability relating to unprotected POST routes."
