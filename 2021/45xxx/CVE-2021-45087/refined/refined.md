Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-45087:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   **Missing Output Encoding:** The core issue is that the Epiphany browser fails to properly encode untrusted data, specifically page titles, before injecting them into the DOM (Document Object Model) of trusted pages, such as `about:overview`.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):**  The lack of output encoding allows malicious websites to inject arbitrary JavaScript code into the browser's interface through the page title. This is a classic XSS vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** An attacker can execute malicious JavaScript code within the context of the vulnerable page.
*  **Bypass of SOP (Same-Origin Policy):** The vulnerability is located within a privileged page (`ephy-about://`), which bypasses the Same-Origin Policy, allowing the attacker to potentially access data and perform actions that would normally be restricted.
*   **Full SOP Bypass:** Since the XSS is in `ephy-about://` and is a privileged page, this can lead to a complete bypass of the Same-Origin Policy.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious Website:** An attacker crafts a website with a malicious payload in its page title.
*   **User Interaction:** The user visits the malicious website with the vulnerable browser. The browser then saves information about this page, including the title, to display it in the `about:overview` page.
*   **`about:overview` display:** When the user navigates to the `about:overview` page, the malicious JavaScript in the title is executed.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Ability to Host Malicious Website:** The attacker needs to be able to host a web page with a specially crafted title containing the XSS payload.
*  **Target User Browsing:** The attacker needs to lure the victim user into browsing the crafted malicious webpage using a vulnerable version of the Epiphany browser.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The vulnerability is specifically triggered when the browser displays the title of a previously visited site within the `about:overview` page.
*   The provided content explicitly mentions that the root cause is **missing output encoding**, not insufficient input validation.
*   The vulnerability is part of a group of related XSS vulnerabilities, CVE-2021-45085, CVE-2021-45086 and CVE-2021-45088 which were fixed at the same time.
