| Summary A crafted AMF XML document can cause a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference during parsing. Vulnerable versions  * Slic3r (commit [b1a5500](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/commit/b1a5500f427700ac3dffc0e7d9535ea65f993537))  Step to reproduce  1. Create the proof-of-concept OBJ file (`nullptr_amf_metadata.amf.xml`):  ``` <amf unit="millimeter"> 	<object id="0"> 		<metadata>dummy</metadata> 	</object> </amf>  ```  2. Execute `slic3r --info nullptr_amf_metadata.amf.xml` 3. Observe segmentation fault.  Example file [nullptr\_amf\_metadata.amf.xml.zip](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/files/7777329/nullptr_amf_metadata.amf.xml.zip) Cause An attempt is made to read the `type` attribute of the `<metadata>` tag, at [AMF.cpp:189](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/blob/b1a5500f427700ac3dffc0e7d9535ea65f993537/xs/src/libslic3r/IO/AMF.cpp#L189). The PoC contains a `metadata` tag without a `type` attribute.  `get_attribute()` returns NULL, and thus the creation of the `std::string m_value[0]` crashes. Impact Denial of Service. Proposed mitigation Check for NULL before trying to construct the `std::string`, set a default value or reject the tag. Similar checks are already in place at [line 163](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/blob/b1a5500f427700ac3dffc0e7d9535ea65f993537/xs/src/libslic3r/IO/AMF.cpp#L163) and others. |
