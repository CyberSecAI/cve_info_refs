The provided content discusses CVE-2021-45846.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a NULL pointer dereference within the AMF XML parser in Slic3r. Specifically, the parser attempts to access the `type` attribute of a `<metadata>` tag without checking if the attribute exists.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of input validation/sanitization: The AMF XML parser does not check for the existence of the `type` attribute before attempting to access it.
- NULL pointer dereference: When the `type` attribute is missing, `get_attribute()` returns NULL, leading to a NULL pointer dereference when the code tries to create a `std::string` from the NULL value.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Denial of Service (DoS): Exploiting this vulnerability causes a segmentation fault, leading to a crash of the Slic3r application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Maliciously crafted AMF XML file: An attacker can create a specially crafted AMF XML file that includes a `<metadata>` tag without the required `type` attribute.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the crafted AMF XML file as input to the Slic3r application (e.g., through the command line).

**Additional notes:**
- The issue was found in commit `b1a5500` of the Slic3r repository.
- A fix was proposed by checking for NULL before creating the `std::string` or by setting a default value or rejecting the tag. Similar checks were already present in other parts of the code (line 163).
- The vulnerability was fixed in SuperSlicer with the commit `211aaa3d32648d5b0a6f038213bd797457308d5b`.
- The patch was also applied to DzzD's SuperSlicer fork with commit `d4bedc5c5b5451471800d908e42ccf2e9194d98d`.
