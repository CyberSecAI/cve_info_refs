The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, which is related to CVE-2021-45669.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored XSS vulnerability found in certain NETGEAR router and WiFi system models.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation of the stored XSS vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface of the affected devices. This could lead to actions being performed in the context of a logged-in administrator or user's session, potentially leading to information theft, account compromise, or other malicious activity.
  
**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered when a user interacts with the affected device's web interface, where malicious script has previously been stored/injected. This indicates that an attacker would need a way to inject the malicious script into a persistent location in the router's web interface. 

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to inject malicious code into a part of the web interface that gets stored. This likely requires some level of authenticated access to device settings, or a vulnerability that allows unauthenticated access to these stored settings.
- The attacker needs a way to trick the victim into viewing the manipulated data to trigger the injected code.

**Affected products:**
The following product models are affected (with vulnerable firmware versions):
- RAX200 (prior to 1.0.3.106)
