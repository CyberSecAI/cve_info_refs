Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45290:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is caused by a missing check for the validity of the input type when parsing the `ref.as` instruction in WebAssembly binary format. Specifically, if the type is invalid, the code attempts to create and finalize the node. This leads to an assertion failure within the `finalize()` method before the validator is reached.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Missing Input Validation:** The primary weakness is the lack of validation of the input type during the parsing of a `ref.as` instruction.
- **Assertion Failure:** The absence of validation allows the program to proceed with processing an invalid input type, leading to a failed assertion.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The immediate impact is an assertion abort, causing the program to terminate unexpectedly. This can lead to a denial of service if an attacker provides malicious input that triggers this assertion repeatedly.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Malicious WebAssembly Binary:** An attacker can craft a malicious WebAssembly binary that contains a `ref.as` instruction with an invalid input type.
- **Processing of Malicious Input:** The attack is triggered when the vulnerable `binaryen` tool processes this crafted binary.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Craft WebAssembly Binaries:** An attacker needs the ability to create or modify WebAssembly binaries.
- **Ability to Feed Malicious Input to Binaryen:** The attacker must be able to provide the crafted WebAssembly binary as input to the vulnerable `binaryen` tool.

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability occurs in the `wasm::handle_unreachable` function, triggered by an invalid type being used with the `ref.as` instruction.
- The fix was implemented by adding a check for the validity of the input type in `ref.as` during the binary format parsing. This prevents the code from proceeding if the type is invalid.
- The fix was included in Binaryen version 105, as well as versions 104 that incorporated the fix.
- Fedora has issued updates for Fedora 34 and 35 to include this fix.

In summary, CVE-2021-45290 is a vulnerability in the Binaryen WebAssembly toolchain caused by a lack of input validation when parsing the `ref.as` instruction. This can lead to a denial of service if malicious WebAssembly binaries are processed. The fix involves adding a check for the validity of the type during parsing to prevent assertion failures.
