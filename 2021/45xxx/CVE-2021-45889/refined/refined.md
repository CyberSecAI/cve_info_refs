Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45889:

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a lack of proper input sanitization in multiple functions of the PONTON X/P Messenger web interface. This allows for the injection of malicious code through URL parameters.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities are present. Specifically, the application fails to properly sanitize user-controlled input before rendering it in the web page.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web application. When a user accesses a crafted URL, this code will be executed in their browser within the context of the vulnerable web application. This could lead to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious actions.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The attack vector is through crafted URLs with malicious JavaScript payloads embedded in the URL parameters.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft malicious URLs and trick a user with valid credentials into clicking on those URLs. The user must also have access to the PONTON X/P web interface, which is normally only accessible on the internal network.

**Technical Details:**

*   The advisory identifies three distinct categories of reflected XSS vulnerabilities:
    1.  **JavaScript Injection:**  Payload injected directly into a JavaScript context. An example URL is provided: `https://localhost:8443/pontonxp/private/index.jsp?partners/ShowNonLocalPartners.do?localID=%27-prompt(%22SySS%20RXSS%20PoC%22)//.`
    2.  **Iframe Injection:** Payload is injected into the `src` attribute of an iframe tag.  An example URL is provided: `https://localhost:8443/pontonxp/private/index.jsp?javascript:alert(%27SySS\_RXSS\_PoC%27)`.
    3.  **Iframe Breakout:** Payload is used to break out of the iframe context and execute arbitrary JavaScript. Several example URLs are provided, such as `https://localhost:8443/pontonxp/private/index.jsp?database/databaseTab.jsp?syss%22%3E%3C/iframe%3E%3Cscript%3Ealert(%22SySS%20RXSS%20PoC%22);%3C/script%3E`.
*   The vulnerability was found in PONTON X/P Messenger versions 3.8.0 (Build 201909201204) and 3.10.0 (Build 202009171429).
*   The issue is fixed in version 3.11.2.
