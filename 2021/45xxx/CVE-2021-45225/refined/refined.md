Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45225:

**1. Verification:**

The provided content directly references CVE-2021-45225, confirming its relevance.

**2. Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Improper neutralization of input during web page generation. Specifically, user-controlled URL parameters are incorporated into HTML tag attributes without proper sanitization.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
    *   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (RXSS):** The application is vulnerable to reflected XSS attacks. Malicious JavaScript code can be injected via URL parameters.
    *   **Unsafe JavaScript Incorporation:** In the activity view window, injected parameters are also incorporated into JavaScript code unsafely, allowing another type of payload execution. This method bypasses filters attempting to remove HTML tags.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code within the user's browser. This could lead to:
    *   Session hijacking
    *   Defacement of the website
    *   Redirection to malicious sites
    *   Stealing of sensitive user information
    *   Other malicious actions within the context of the user's session
*  **Attack Vectors:**
    *   **Malicious URL Links:** Attackers can craft malicious links containing the XSS payload within specific URL parameters. These links can then be distributed via various methods (e.g., email, social media, other websites).
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
    *   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the payload injected into the vulnerable parameters.
    *   The attacker needs to convince a user of the application to click/visit the crafted URL.

**3. Affected Parameters:**

*   **Search Window:**
    *   `querySortOrder`
    *  `queryFilterType`
*   **Activity View Window:**
    *   `pvCILevel`
    *   `pvCISibling`
    *   `TopMenu`

**4. Proof of Concept (PoC):**

*   **Search:** Append `%22%3e%3cscript%3ealert(1)%3c%2fscript%3` to the value of a vulnerable parameter (e.g. `querySortOrder`) in the URL. Visiting the modified URL will trigger the payload.
*   **Activity view:** Append `%22-alert(1)-%22` to the value of a vulnerable parameter (e.g. `TopMenu`) in the URL. Visiting the modified URL will trigger the payload.

**5. Additional Information:**

*   The advisory notes that the second injection type in the activity view window bypasses basic HTML tag filters
*   The advisory also mentions that no solution has been provided by the vendor at the time of disclosure.
*   The vulnerability was discovered on 2021-04-20 and reported to the manufacturer on 2021-11-02.
*   Public disclosure occurred on 2022-01-13.
*   The affected product is COINS Construction Cloud version 11.12

**Summary:**

The provided content details a reflected XSS vulnerability in COINS Construction Cloud. The vulnerability stems from the improper handling of user-supplied URL parameters, which are directly inserted into the HTML attributes without sanitization and also into JavaScript code in the activity view window. This allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary JavaScript in the user's browser by enticing them to visit a crafted link, posing risks including session hijacking and data theft.
