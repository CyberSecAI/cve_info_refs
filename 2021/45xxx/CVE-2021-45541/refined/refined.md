Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
Post-authentication command injection vulnerability

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability allows for command injection after successful authentication to the affected devices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of the vulnerability could lead to a complete compromise of the affected device. The CVSS score reflects high impact with high confidentiality, integrity and availability impact.

**Attack vectors:**
