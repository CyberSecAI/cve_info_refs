{
  "vulnerability": {
    "root_cause": "The CSS parser of the Html2Pdf library uses the `file_get_contents` function with an attacker-controlled argument from the link tag's href attribute. This function supports several protocols, including HTTP(S) and PHAR.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) due to the usage of `file_get_contents` with attacker controlled input.",
      "Insecure PHAR deserialization due to usage of `phar://` wrapper in `file_get_contents`"
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can perform a blind SSRF attack. Furthermore, by exploiting the PHAR deserialization vulnerability, the attacker can achieve Remote Code Execution (RCE) on the server running the Html2Pdf library.",
    "attack_vectors": [
      "By injecting a crafted `<link>` tag with `type='text/css'` and a `href` attribute using the `http(s)://` wrapper, an attacker can trigger an SSRF.",
       "By injecting a crafted `<link>` tag with `type='text/css'` and a `href` attribute using the `phar://` wrapper, pointing to a malicious PHAR archive, an attacker can trigger PHP deserialization and achieve RCE."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to control the HTML content provided to the Html2Pdf library. For RCE, the attacker also needs to be able to store a malicious PHAR file on the server's file system."
