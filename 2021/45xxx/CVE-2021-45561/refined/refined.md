Based on the provided document, here's the vulnerability information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows for command injection after a user has successfully authenticated to the device.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to a complete compromise of the affected devices, allowing attackers to execute arbitrary commands on the system. This may include changing configurations, extracting sensitive data, or using the compromised device in further attacks.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a vulnerability that occurs post-authentication, suggesting that a weakness in processing or handling user-supplied data or commands exists after the authentication phase of device operation. This could involve manipulating input fields, parameters, or commands once logged in.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
   - The attacker needs to have valid user credentials to authenticate to the device before exploiting the command injection vulnerability.
   - The attacker would likely need to interact with a web interface or similar interface on the affected devices to trigger the vulnerable code.
   - Access to the device's network to reach the login page would also be required.

**Affected Devices:**
   - RBK752
   - RBR750
   - RBS750
   - RBK852
   - RBR850
   - RBS850

**Firmware:**
   - Vulnerable versions are prior to 3.2.16.6
