The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified as PSV-2020-0128. Although the advisory does not explicitly mention CVE-2021-45675, it details the vulnerability, affected products, and necessary mitigations, which may be related if CVE-2021-45675 is assigned to this issue.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in the web interface of several NETGEAR router models.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS). This allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the router's web interface, which will be executed when other users access the interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of the userâ€™s browser when they interact with the vulnerable web interface of the router. This could lead to various malicious activities including session hijacking, credential theft, and other unauthorized actions.

**Attack vectors:**
The vulnerability is exploited by injecting malicious JavaScript into the router's web interface. The exact input vectors are not detailed, but it can be inferred that the vulnerability is in a form or field where user data is stored, and improperly sanitized upon retrieval and display in the web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious scripts into the vulnerable web interface. This likely involves being able to access the router's configuration interface, which would typically require having administrative privileges or finding an accessible but vulnerable input field.

**Additional details:**
- The advisory provides a list of affected NETGEAR router models and firmware versions that are vulnerable.
- It recommends updating the router firmware to the latest available version to mitigate the vulnerability.
- It includes a CVSS score of 5.8, categorizing the vulnerability as Medium severity with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:H/I:L/A:N.
- The advisory also states that the vulnerability remains if the recommended steps are not followed.
