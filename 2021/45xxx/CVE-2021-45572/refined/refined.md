The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, identified as PSV-2020-0080, affecting specific models of their WiFi systems. Although the advisory does not list a CVE ID, it provides detailed information regarding the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Command Injection: The vulnerability allows an authenticated attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the affected device, allowing an attacker to take control of the system. This includes potential access to sensitive information, disruption of network services, or using the device as a launching point for further attacks.
*   High Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability Impact: The CVSS vector highlights that exploitation can lead to high impacts on confidentiality, integrity and availability.

**Attack vectors:**
*   Network Access: The vulnerability is exploited through network access, likely through the web management interface or other network services.
*   Authentication Required: The attacker must be authenticated to the device before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   Authenticated User: The attacker needs to have valid credentials to log in to the device.
*   Network Access: The attacker must be able to communicate with the vulnerable device.

The advisory also provides a list of affected products, the impacted firmware versions, and remediation instructions.
*   **Affected Models:** RBK752, RBR750, RBS750, RBK852, RBR850, RBS850
*   **Affected Firmware:** Firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6 on all listed models.
*   **Remediation:** Update to the latest firmware version available for your device.

It also includes a CVSS vector and score:
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.4 (Medium)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
    *   **AV:A** (Attack Vector: Adjacent Network)
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *  **PR:H** (Privileges Required: High)
    *   **UI:N** (User Interaction: None)
    *   **S:C** (Scope: Changed)
    *   **C:H** (Confidentiality Impact: High)
    *   **I:H** (Integrity Impact: High)
    *   **A:H** (Availability Impact: High)

This vulnerability, though not associated with a CVE ID within this document, is critical due to its potential for complete device compromise, and users are advised to update their firmware immediately.
