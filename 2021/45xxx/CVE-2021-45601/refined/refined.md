The provided document details a post-authentication command injection vulnerability in several NETGEAR WiFi systems.

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability stems from a post-authentication command injection flaw, although the specific injection point and mechanism are not detailed.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- Post-authentication command injection.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary command execution on the affected device.
- This could potentially allow an attacker to gain complete control of the device.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), implying an attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the affected device.
- The attack requires high privileges (PR:H) meaning an attacker needs to be an authenticated user.
- The attack does not require user interaction (UI:N).

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must be on the same network as the vulnerable device.
- The attacker must have valid credentials to authenticate to the device.

**Affected Products:**
*   CBR40, running firmware versions prior to 2.5.0.24
*   CBR750, running firmware versions prior to 4.6.3.6
*   RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
