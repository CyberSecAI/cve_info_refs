**CVE-2021-45925: Username Enumeration**

*   **Root Cause:** The web application of the Lanner IAC-AST2500A BMC firmware, based on AMI MegaRAC SP-X, has a vulnerability that allows an attacker to determine valid usernames.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability lies in the way the application handles login attempts, revealing whether a username exists in the system or not.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:**  An attacker can enumerate valid usernames, which can then be used in further attacks (like password guessing/brute force). While the vulnerability itself does not allow for direct compromise, it provides an attacker with valuable information to prepare other attacks.
*   **Attack Vector:** The vulnerability can be exploited remotely over the network via the web interface.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker does not need any authentication to exploit this vulnerability and can be located anywhere with network access to the web interface.
