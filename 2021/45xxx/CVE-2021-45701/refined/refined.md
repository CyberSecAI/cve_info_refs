Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45701:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an optimization in the `tremor-script` language related to `merge` and `patch` operations on the `state` variable.  This optimization involved in-place manipulation of the target value instead of cloning it. The `Value` struct uses borrowed strings (`beef::Cow<'lifetime, str>`) that reference the underlying byte array of an `event`. When `state` was introduced, it became possible to persist `Value` data beyond the lifetime of an event.  If `event` data was merged or patched into `state` without cloning `state` first, the references in `state` could point to the memory of previous, now invalid, events.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Use-after-free:** The core weakness is a use-after-free vulnerability. By not cloning the state before merging or patching event data into it, the code can access memory regions that have already been freed when the original event's data is no longer valid.
- **Memory Corruption/Exposure:** Accessing freed memory leads to memory corruption or information exposure, as attackers could potentially read sensitive data.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Memory Corruption:**  Accessing freed memory regions could cause application crashes or undefined behavior.
- **Information Disclosure:** The attacker can potentially read sensitive information from freed memory, which could be transmitted over the network.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker needs to craft a `tremor-script` that uses `merge` or `patch` operations on the `state` variable and reassigns the result back to `state`, where the merge or patch operation uses data from the current `event`.
- The vulnerable code pattern is:
  ```
  let state = merge state of event end;
  ```
  or
   ```
  let state = patch state of insert event.key => event.value end;
  ```

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to provide the malicious `tremor-script` logic that uses the vulnerable constructs (merge or patch on `state` that reference `event` and reassign the result back to `state`).

**Additional Details:**

- The vulnerability is present in versions of `tremor-script` prior to 0.11.6 and is not present in versions 0.7.2 and earlier.
- The fix involves removing the optimization and always cloning the target expression during a `merge` or `patch` operation, ensuring that the `state` does not contain references to freed memory.
- A workaround exists by using a temporary variable to store the result before reassigning to `state`, which avoids the in-place optimization:
```
let tmp = merge state of event end;
let state = tmp
```
