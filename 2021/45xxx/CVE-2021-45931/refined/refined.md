  "vulnerability_details": [
    {
      "cve_id": "CVE-2021-45931",
      "root_cause": "An out-of-bounds write vulnerability exists in the `hb_bit_set_invertible_t::set` function due to incorrect handling of the `inverted` flag when setting a bit set from another bit set.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Out-of-bounds write",
        "Incorrect flag handling"
       ],
      "impact": "Arbitrary code execution could potentially occur due to the out-of-bounds write.",
      "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is triggered when processing specially crafted input that uses the affected `hb_bit_set_invertible_t::set` operation within the HarfBuzz library.",
       "required_attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs to be able to provide crafted data to an application using the HarfBuzz library that triggers the vulnerable `hb_bit_set_invertible_t::set` code path.",
      "additional_details": "The vulnerability is located within the `src/hb-bit-set-invertible.hh` file in HarfBuzz. The fix ensures that the `inverted` flag is only updated if the set operation is successful (i.e. `s.successful` flag is true). The commit `d3e09bf` introduces this fix."
