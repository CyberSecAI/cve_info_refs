- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A mismatch exists in Apache Kylin between how the project name is validated and how it's used in shell command arguments within `DiagnosisService`. This allows an attacker to bypass project name validation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability due to improper sanitization/validation of user-supplied project names before using them in shell commands.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to inject and execute arbitrary commands on the server running Apache Kylin.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability can be triggered by providing a malicious project name during DiagnosisService command execution.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to interact with the DiagnosisService API or functionality that uses the project name.
