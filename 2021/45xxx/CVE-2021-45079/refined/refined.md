Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-45079:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability lies in the incorrect handling of early EAP-Success messages by the strongSwan EAP client implementation. The client improperly assumed the existence of an EAP method instance upon receiving an EAP-Success message. This assumption led to a NULL pointer dereference when trying to retrieve the Master Session Key (MSK) in cases where no EAP method was initiated or completed. It also allowed for authentication bypass in certain configurations.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
1.  **NULL Pointer Dereference:**  The client attempts to access the MSK from an EAP method instance without verifying its existence, leading to a crash.
2.  **Authentication Bypass:** By sending an early EAP-Success message, an attacker can bypass client and potentially server authentication, particularly in EAP-only authentication setups. The client could accept the connection without a proper authentication process.
3.  **Premature EAP Conclusion:** The client prematurely concludes the EAP method upon receiving the malicious EAP-Success message.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Denial of Service:** Sending a very early EAP-Success message can cause the IKE daemon to crash due to a NULL pointer dereference.
*   **Authentication Bypass:**  In EAP-only configurations, a rogue server could bypass both client and server authentication. This allows the attacker to establish a VPN tunnel without proper credentials.
*   **Man-in-the-Middle Attack:** A successful authentication bypass could allow a rogue server to intercept and potentially decrypt traffic sent by the client via the VPN tunnel.
*   **Access to Protected Networks:**  In certain configurations (like TNC with mutual attestation), an attacker could also potentially access hosts behind the client, if its traffic selector included local subnets.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Malicious VPN/AAA Server:** A compromised or rogue VPN server or AAA server sending a malicious EAP-Success message.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   The attacker must control or compromise the VPN or AAA server to be able to send crafted EAP-Success messages.
*   For full bypass of both client and server authentication, an EAP-only authentication scenario is required.

**Additional details:**

*   Affected Versions: All strongSwan versions since 4.1.2 are affected.
*   The vulnerability is triggered by early EAP-Success messages, which can occur before or after a specific EAP method is initiated.
*   The impact varies depending on the configuration and EAP method used. For example, certain EAP methods like EAP-MSCHAPv2, will still require the attacker to know the client's password to complete the handshake, so only authentication of the server would be bypassed.
*   Patches are provided for versions >= 5.0.1.
*   The vulnerability can be mitigated by ensuring that the server authenticates using a certificate first, unless the use case makes the mutual authentication of client and server crucial.
