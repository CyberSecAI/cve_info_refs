The provided content is related to CVE-2021-45810.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability arises because joining a VPN does not require administrator access, allowing a malicious party hosting an OpenConnect server to redirect the host's network traffic through their server. This can be achieved by simply logging into the malicious server. The vulnerability is triggered by sending commands directly to the DBUS service, meaning that hosting a GlobalProtect server is not necessary; any OpenConnect supported VPN server will suffice.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of proper authorization checks for VPN connections.
- Vulnerable use of the DBUS service.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Network traffic redirection to a malicious server, allowing the attacker to intercept and potentially manipulate the victim's traffic.
- Potential for man-in-the-middle attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- A malicious party hosts an OpenConnect server.
- A user connects to this malicious server without requiring administrative privileges.
- The malicious server redirects the user's network traffic.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Ability to host an OpenConnect compatible VPN server.
- Ability to send commands to the DBUS service (or get the user to connect to the malicious server).

**Additional Information:**

- The issue is addressed in the 2.x release of the software.
- The fix includes:
  - CLI version now requires `sudo` for connecting to the portal.
  - The background service no longer depends on DBus.
  - A security key is generated each time the background service starts and passed to the GUI client through stdin.
  - Communication between the GUI client and the background service is now done over WebSocket with encrypted payloads using the generated security key via ChaCha20-Poly1305.
