| Joining a VPN does not require administrator access; a malicious party hosting any openconnect server can redirect the host's network traffic over via their own server.  This vulnerability is executed by…simply logging into their own server.  The same preconditions apply as to [#113](https://github.com/yuezk/GlobalProtect-openconnect/issues/113). Note that hosting a global protect server is not necessary, if commands are sent directly to the DBUS service. In this case, hosting any openconnect supported VPN server will suffice. Proposed Fix See [#113](https://github.com/yuezk/GlobalProtect-openconnect/issues/113) as both vulnerabilities have the same fix. |

| This vulnerability has been addressed in the 2.x release. Reasons are:   1. The CLI version requires `sudo` to connect to the portal. 2. The background service has been rewritten in 2.x, and it no longer depends on DBus. 3. The background service will generate a security key each time it starts, then launch the GUI client and pass the security key to the GUI client via stdin (so that no one can sniff the security key). 4. The GUI client and the background service communicate via WebSocket and all the payloads between them are encrypted using the security key. The encryption algorithm is [ChaCha20-Poly1305](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChaCha20-Poly1305). 5. No one knows the security key other than the background service and the GUI client. |
