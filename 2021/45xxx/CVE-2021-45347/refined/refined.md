The provided content is related to CVE-2021-45347.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authentication mechanism of the zzcms application. It appears the application relies on a username stored in a cookie for authentication, and does not properly validate the associated password.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Insecure cookie handling: The application uses a cookie to store the username, and this cookie can be manipulated by a malicious user.
- Insufficient password verification: The application does not verify the password against the stored user if the username from the cookie matches an existing username.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Authentication bypass: An attacker can bypass the authentication process by changing the username in the cookie to a valid username and using any password to log in.
- Unauthorized access: Successful exploitation allows attackers to gain unauthorized access to the application.

**Attack vectors:**
- Cookie manipulation: The attacker needs to intercept or modify the cookie that contains the username. This can be done client-side with browser developer tools, or through a man-in-the-middle attack.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have the ability to manipulate or modify the browser cookies or intercept network traffic containing cookie data.
- The attacker needs to know or discover a valid username for an account within the vulnerable zzcms application.
