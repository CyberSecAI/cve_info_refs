Product Information

## Ponton X/P – Secure Data Communication and B2B Integration

##### Learn about PONTON’s secure data communication workhorse: The PONTON X/P Messenger (or PONTON X/P for short) is PONTON’s high-quality B2B integration solution with a proven track-record in several industries since 2001.

**PONTON X/P** is a highly configurable ebXML, AS1, AS2, AS3 and AS4 compliant messaging software. It provides additional features to deal with typical B2B integration issues (such as a listener component for the DMZ, certificate management and non-repudiation of messages). **PONTON X/P** is typically used as communication layer in a business consortium or as an (OEM) communication extension of an existing software application.

##### PRE-CONFIGURED PONTON X/P VERSIONS FOR YOUR BUSINESS COMMUNITY

PONTON provides custom-built versions of the **PONTON X/P Messenger** that are pre-configured for quick and easy setup with our supported business consortia. Please contact PONTON Support to obtain the latest version suitable for your organisation. Participants of the EDA network can obtain the current version [here](https://confluence.ponton.de/display/OESD).

##### LEVERAGE PONTON X/P TO SET UP COMMUNICATION AMONG 3 TO 300 PARTICIPANTS

The **PONTON X/P** focus is on **1:1 communication** between business partners. It is used as a bridgehead to connect a participant’s local IT infrastructure to the networks of its partners, typically in decentralized settings or as a standardized communication end point of a central service. *P**ONTON* *X/P* leverages existing communication standards to ensure a secure, guaranteed, and non-reputable (ebMS 2.0, AS4) transfer of messages.

PONTON has been **supporting consortia** from different industries in standardisation and implementation of data exchange infrastrctures for over two decades. **PONTON X/P** is used in sectors like energy (Equias, EDA, SMSS), paper / publishing / logistics (papiNet), and health care (German electronic health card). Check the [references](https://www.ponton.de/ponton-x-p-reference) for details.

PONTON helps consortia to find common ground for their co-operation and to **speak the same language** within business processes. It is a common business model to procure a consortium-wide license from PONTON and share the cost within the consortium. This approach provides maximum interoperability through standardisation, while maintaining low cost of operation.
