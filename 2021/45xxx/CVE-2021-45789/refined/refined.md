- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from the `loadFileAsBytes` function in `ApiAutomationService.java`. This function constructs a file path using user-provided input (`fileOperationRequest.getId()` and `fileOperationRequest.getName()`) without proper sanitization or validation. Specifically, the constructed file path is:  `FileUtils.BODY_FILE_DIR + "/" + fileOperationRequest.getId() + "_" + fileOperationRequest.getName()`
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is an arbitrary file read due to the lack of input sanitization. By manipulating the `fileOperationRequest.getName()` parameter, an attacker can craft a path that points to any file on the server, escaping the intended directory, and potentially accessing sensitive system files.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an authenticated attacker to read the contents of arbitrary files on the server. This could expose sensitive information, including configuration files, application code, and potentially credentials.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is the `/api/automation/file/download` API endpoint. An authenticated user can send a crafted request to this endpoint, manipulating the `fileOperationRequest.getName()` parameter to access arbitrary files.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be an authenticated user of the application. They also need the ability to make API requests.
