Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45010:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is due to insufficient path traversal sanitization in the file upload functionality of Tiny File Manager. Specifically, the `fullpath` parameter within the file upload request is not properly validated, allowing an attacker to manipulate this parameter by injecting directory traversal sequences such as "../".

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Path Traversal:** The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue. By prepending sequences like `../../` to the filename provided in the `fullpath` parameter during a file upload, an authenticated attacker can write files to arbitrary locations outside the intended upload directory.
- **Full Path Disclosure:** An additional vulnerability is the exposure of the webroot directory path when an invalid URL is supplied to the upload functionality. This information leak is used to identify where to place the malicious file to gain remote code execution.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** The combination of path traversal and path disclosure vulnerabilities allows for the upload of a malicious PHP file (webshell) into the webroot directory, which can then be accessed to execute arbitrary commands on the server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability results in:
- **Arbitrary File Upload:** An attacker can upload files to any location on the server where the web server has write permissions.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By uploading and accessing a malicious PHP file (webshell), the attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the server, potentially gaining full control of the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attack vector is through the web interface of Tiny File Manager.
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with access to the file upload functionality.
- The attacker crafts a malicious file upload request with a manipulated `fullpath` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker must have valid login credentials for the Tiny File Manager application.
- The attacker must have network access to the Tiny File Manager instance to be able to send the malicious requests.

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerability was identified and patched by the user "febinrev".
- The patch involves replacing instances of "./" with "_" in the `fullpath` parameter to prevent directory traversal.
- The provided exploit scripts automate the process of exploiting this vulnerability, including login, webroot disclosure, shell upload, and command execution.
- This exploit works for Tiny File Manager versions <= 2.4.3 (as mentioned in the exploit script, and in the blog post) .
- The exploit scripts also highlight how the path disclosure vulnerability is abused in order to find the webroot directory where the web shell is uploaded.
