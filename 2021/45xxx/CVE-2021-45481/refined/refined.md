Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerabilities related to CVE-2021-45481, CVE-2021-45482 and CVE-2021-45483:

**CVE-2021-45481**

*   **Root Cause:** Incorrect memory allocation in `WebCore::ImageBufferCairoImageSurfaceBackend::create`.
*   **Weakness:** The code attempts to allocate an extremely large amount of memory due to a lack of proper input validation, leading to an allocation size that exceeds the maximum supported size.
*  **Impact:** This can lead to an application crash (SEGV) due to the failed allocation.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted web content. Specifically, the provided information links to an HTML file (`incorrect_malloc.html`).
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to serve or cause a user to open the malicious HTML file.

**CVE-2021-45482**

*   **Root Cause:** Use-after-free in `WebCore::ContainerNode::firstChild`.
*   **Weakness:**  The vulnerability occurs due to a dangling pointer caused by improper management of memory, specifically when accessing a freed `SVGElement`.
*   **Impact:**  This can lead to a heap-use-after-free, causing a crash, and potentially allowing arbitrary code execution in a real exploit.
*  **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted web content. The provided information references `uaf-firstchild.html`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to serve or cause a user to open the malicious HTML file.

**CVE-2021-45483**

*   **Root Cause:** Heap-use-after-free in `WebCore::Frame::page`.
*   **Weakness:** The vulnerability occurs when the code attempts to access a `WebCore::Page` object through a dangling weak pointer after the object has been deallocated, leading to memory corruption.
*  **Impact:** This can lead to a heap-use-after-free, causing a crash and possibly leading to arbitrary code execution in a real-world exploit.
*   **Attack Vector:** Maliciously crafted web content, specifically, the provided information links to the `uaf-page.html`.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:**  The attacker needs to be able to serve or cause a user to open the malicious HTML file.

**Summary of Vulnerabilities:**

All three vulnerabilities are related to memory management issues within the WebKit rendering engine. They can be triggered by processing malicious web content, potentially leading to application crashes and possibly arbitrary code execution, impacting the security of applications using WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit. The vulnerabilities were addressed in the versions indicated in the security advisory and the advisories recommend updating to the latest stable versions.
