The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, it does not relate to CVE-2021-45666.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** The vulnerability is due to a stored XSS flaw in the firmware of several NETGEAR extenders and WiFi systems.
*   **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:** The advisory specifically mentions a "stored cross site scripting security vulnerability". This means that malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the vulnerable devices, and then executed when other users interact with the affected part of the application/device.
*   **Impact of Exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of other users accessing the device's interface. This may lead to session hijacking, account compromise, or other malicious activities.  The CVSS score indicates that confidentiality, integrity, and availability could be impacted to varying degrees.
*   **Attack Vectors:** The advisory does not explicitly describe the attack vector beyond being stored XSS. However, stored XSS typically involves injecting malicious code through a vulnerable input point, such as a form field or configuration setting, that is then stored in the device and presented to other users.
*   **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:** The attacker would need to have the ability to inject malicious scripts through a user interface available on the affected devices. The advisory mentions that a High level of Privileges (PR:H) is needed, indicating the attacker must be a logged in user of the device. The exploit also has to be initiated by the victim (UI:R). The vulnerability would be on the system affected (S:C).
