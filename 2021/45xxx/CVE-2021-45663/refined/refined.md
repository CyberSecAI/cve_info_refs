- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The device is susceptible to stored XSS, where malicious scripts can be injected and stored on the device, then executed when other users interact with the vulnerable part of the application.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the device, which will be executed when a user interacts with the vulnerable area. This could lead to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions performed in the context of the victim user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the device's web interface where an attacker can inject malicious scripts.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have the capability to interact with the web interface to inject the malicious script. The advisory states the CVSS score has a requirement of high privileges. This suggests that the attacker likely needs to be authenticated to inject the malicious script.
