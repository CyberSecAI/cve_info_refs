The provided content is related to a Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability in specific NETGEAR Smart Managed Pro Switches.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored XSS issue, indicating that malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the device's configuration or data, which is then executed when other users access the affected areas.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers when they interact with the vulnerable parts of the switch's management interface.
- This could lead to session hijacking, credential theft, or defacement of the management interface.

**Attack vectors:**
-  An attacker injects malicious javascript into a stored area of the device (configuration, data, etc), which is then executed when other users access that area.
- The attack vector is via the web management interface, since the issue is a stored XSS.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to inject malicious script into the vulnerable areas of the switch's interface. This would likely require some level of authentication to the web interface, or some other vector into a stored data location on the switch.

**Affected Devices:**
- GS108Tv2, running firmware versions prior to 5.4.2.36
- GS110TPv2, running firmware versions prior to 5.4.2.36
