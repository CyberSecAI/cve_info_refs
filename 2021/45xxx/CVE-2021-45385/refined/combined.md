fix issue [#47](https://github.com/rockcarry/ffjpeg/issues/47)

When bmp's size is out of range, it returns without assign memory buffer to `pb->pdata` and did not exit the program.

So the program crashes when it tries to access the `pb->data` in jfif.c:763, which is a invalid memory address.

[ffjpeg/src/jfif.c](https://github.com/rockcarry/ffjpeg/blob/d5cfd49f304e2b8eafc0d473d1c217b1c761243b/src/jfif.c#L757-L763)

in
[d5cfd49](/rockcarry/ffjpeg/commit/d5cfd49f304e2b8eafc0d473d1c217b1c761243b)

|  | bsrc = pb->pdata; |
| --- | --- |
|  | ydst = yuv\_datbuf[0]; |
|  | udst = yuv\_datbuf[1]; |
|  | vdst = yuv\_datbuf[2]; |
|  | for (i=0; i<pb->height; i++) { |
|  | for (j=0; j<pb->width; j++) { |
|  | rgb\_to\_yuv(bsrc[2], bsrc[1], bsrc[0], ydst, udst, vdst); |

Sorry, something went wrong.
