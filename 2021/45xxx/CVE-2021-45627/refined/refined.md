The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability. It includes details about the affected products, the vulnerability itself, and remediation steps. Here's a breakdown:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a pre-authentication command injection flaw. This means an attacker can inject malicious commands without needing to authenticate to the device.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the ability to inject arbitrary commands into the system through a pre-authentication interface.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Full System Compromise:** The CVSS score indicates a critical impact, with high scores for Confidentiality, Integrity, and Availability. This implies a successful exploit could allow the attacker to gain complete control of the device.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Network adjacent:** The CVSS vector (AV:A) indicates the attacker needs to be on the same network as the vulnerable device or in a network adjacent to it.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- **Unauthenticated, Adjacent Access:** The attacker does not need any prior access to the device (PR:N) but must be able to reach the device via the network (AV:A).

**Affected Products and Firmware:**

The following NETGEAR products are affected if they are running firmware versions prior to the listed fix:

*   CBR750: Firmware versions prior to 4.6.3.6
*   RBK852: Firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBR850: Firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
*   RBS850: Firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12

**Mitigation:**
- NETGEAR recommends updating the firmware of the affected products to the versions specified or later. The advisory provides steps on how to download and update the firmware.

**CVSS Details:**
*   **CVSS Rating:** Critical
*   **CVSS Score:** 9.6
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
    *   **AV:A (Attack Vector: Adjacent):** The attack can occur from the same network.
    *   **AC:L (Attack Complexity: Low):** The attack is relatively easy to execute.
    *  **PR:N (Privileges Required: None):** No authentication is required.
    *  **UI:N (User Interaction: None):** No user interaction is required to perform the attack
    *   **S:C (Scope: Changed):** A successful exploit can impact resources beyond the vulnerable component.
    *   **C:H (Confidentiality: High):** There is a high impact on data confidentiality.
    *   **I:H (Integrity: High):** There is a high impact on data integrity.
    *   **A:H (Availability: High):** There is a high impact on the availability of the system.

**Additional Information:**
* The advisory includes links to NETGEAR's support and community pages.
*  It also has a disclaimer and information about updating firmware and best practices.
*  The vulnerability is identified as "PSV-2020-0471" and has associated CVE ID.
