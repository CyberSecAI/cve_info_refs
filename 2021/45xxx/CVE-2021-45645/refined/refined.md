The provided document is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a security misconfiguration vulnerability, identified as PSV-2021-0127, affecting multiple WiFi system models. Although the advisory does not directly mention a CVE ID, the provided information can be analyzed to understand the vulnerability details.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The advisory describes a "security misconfiguration" without providing further details on what exactly the misconfiguration is, but it is present in the firmware of the affected devices.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Security misconfiguration in the affected firmware.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The CVSS vector suggests the following:
    - **Confidentiality:** High (H), meaning sensitive data could be exposed.
    - **Integrity:** Low (L), meaning some data modification might be possible.
    - **Availability:** None (N), meaning the system's operation might not be disrupted.
    - Overall, the exploitation could lead to a partial compromise of the affected systems.
- The document implies that the misconfiguration can be exploited to compromise the confidentiality and integrity of the affected systems, without impacting the system's availability.

**Attack vectors:**
- The CVSS vector specifies that the attack vector is "Adjacent" (AV:A), implying that the attacker needs to be within the same network as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The CVSS vector indicates the following:
    - The attacker does not require any privileges (PR:N)
    - No user interaction is required (UI:N)
    - The scope is changed (S:C), meaning that the vulnerability may impact resources beyond the vulnerable component itself.
- Based on these, the attacker must be within the same network as the vulnerable device and no specific user interaction is required for the exploit.

**Affected Products/Versions:**
-   RBS50Y, SRK60, SRR60, SRS60, SRC60 running firmware versions prior to 2.7.0.122
-   SXK30, SXR30, SXS30 running firmware versions prior to 3.2.33.108
