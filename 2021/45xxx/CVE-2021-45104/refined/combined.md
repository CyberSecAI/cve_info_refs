## HTCONDOR-2022-0002

## [CVE-2021-45104](http://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45104)

---

**Summary:**

A piece of secret information is sent over the network in the clear if
the administrator has configured weaker encryption protocols or if
some of the HTCondor daemons are version 8.8 or earlier.
An attacker could use this secret information to control the slot of
another user, including running their own code as that user.
An attacker could also impersonate a condor\_negotiator and
condor\_startd, tricking the condor\_schedd into sending them the jobs
of any user.

| Component | Vulnerable Versions | Platform | Availability | Fix Available |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Schedd daemon | 8.9.3 and above | All platforms | Not known to be publicly exploited | 9.0.10, 9.6.0 |
| Status | Access Required | Host Type Required | Effort Required | Impact/Consequences |
| Verified | Ability to capture network traffic between Schedd and Startd or Collector | N/A | High | High |
| Fixed Date | Credit |
| 2022-03-15 | Brian Bockelman, Jaime Frey |

**Access Required:** Ability to capture network traffic between Schedd and Startd or Collector

An attacker must be able to capture network traffic between a
condor\_schedd and a condor\_startd or condor\_collector.
The HTCondor daemons must be configured to use BLOWFISH or 3DES
encryption (the default is AES in 9.0 and above) and match password
authentication enabled (the default) to be vulnerable.
A condor\_schedd communicating to a version 8.8 peer is most likely to
be vulnerable.

**Effort Required:** High

A good understanding of the HTCondor network protocol and access to
network traffic.

**Impact/Consequences Required:** High

Using the secret information, an attacker could manipulate a user's
running job, including evicting that job or replacing that job with
one that executes the attacker's own code.
The attacker could impersonate a condor\_startd and cause the
condor\_schedd to send them a user's jobs for execution, allowing the
attacker to read private data and return bogus results.

**Workaround:**

Upgrading all HTCondor daemons to version 9.0.10 or 9.6.0 fully
addresses this vulnerability.

If upgrading isn't possible, the easiest workaround is to ensure all machines are running HTCondor
9.0.0 or above, and that the `SEC_XXX_ENCRYPTION_METHODS`
configuration parameters are either unset or list "AES" as the first
entry.

If some machines cannot be upgraded to 9.0.0 or above, then you can
configure all machines to use encryption for all communications.
To do this, set `SEC_DEFAULT_ENCRYPTION=REQUIRED` and ensure no other
`SEC_XXX_ENCRYPTION` parameters set a different value.
In 9.0 and above, the configuration templates `use SECURITY: strong`
and `use SECURITY: recommended_v9_0` also enable encryption.

If some of your execute or central manager machines cannot be upgraded
to 9.0.0 or above and their configuration cannot be altered to require
encryption, you can disable match password authentication on your
submit machines.
To do this, set `SEC_ENABLE_MATCH_PASSWORD_AUTHENTICATION=False` in
the configuration files.
Be advised that this may require additional configuration for
authentication and authorization between your submit and execute
machines.
It can also put significant extra load on your submit machines in a
large pool (thousands of nodes).

**Full Details:**

Embargoed until future notice.
