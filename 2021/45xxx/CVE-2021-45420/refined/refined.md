Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerabilities associated with CVE-2021-45420:

**1. Arbitrary File Write**

*   **Root Cause:**  The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or validation of file paths and names when writing files through specific CGI scripts on the Emerson Dixell XWEB-500 device.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **CWE-73:** External Control of File Name or Path - The application allows external control over the file name or path used in file system operations.
    *   Lack of authentication: The file write operations through the vulnerable CGI scripts do not require any authentication.
*   **Impact:** An attacker can write arbitrary files to the target system. This can lead to:
    *   Denial of Service (DoS) by filling up the filesystem with data.
    *   Potentially other impacts depending on the content of the written file (e.g., malicious code execution if the file is placed in a location where it can be executed by the system).
*   **Attack Vector:**  Network-based. An attacker sends a crafted request to the vulnerable CGI scripts.
*   **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoints on the target device. No authentication is required.
*   **Vulnerable Assets:**
    *   `http://<target>/cgi-bin/logo_extra_upload.cgi`
    *   `http://<target>/cgi-bin/cal_save.cgi`
    *   `http://<target>/cgi-bin/lo_utils.cgi`

**2. Directory Listing**

*   **Root Cause:** The webserver is misconfigured to allow directory listing for specific directories.
*   **Weaknesses:**
    *   **CWE-548:** Exposure of Information Through Directory Listing - The server exposes a listing of files and directories to unauthorized users.
*   **Impact:**
    *   Information Disclosure: Attackers can view the file structure and contents of accessible directories.
    *   Further Exploitation:  Exposure of `.jar` files allowed for reverse engineering, which could reveal hidden CGI scripts or other vulnerabilities.
*   **Attack Vector:** Network-based. An attacker sends a request to a directory on the target device.
*    **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the target device. No authentication is required.
*   **Vulnerable Assets:**
    *    `http://<target>/<folder>/` (Specifically the java directory is noted).

**Additional Information from the content:**
*   Emerson has stated that the XWEB-500 product is no longer supported since 2018. They recommend replacing it with the XWEB PRO.
*   The vendor suggests that customers contact their support for further information on supported products.
