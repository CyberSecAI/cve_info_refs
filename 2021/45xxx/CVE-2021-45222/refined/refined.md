Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-45222

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from a logical flaw in the "Personnel Workbench" interface within the COINS Construction Cloud ERP system. Specifically, it allows HR personnel to modify user information in an unsafe manner.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unsafe Privilege Management:** HR personnel can modify the "System User ID" and the associated email address of existing users through the "Personnel Workbench".

- **Data Breach/Manipulation:** Once an attacker gains access to a different account, they can potentially access, modify or steal sensitive information.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Web Interface:** The attack is performed through the web interface of the COINS Construction Cloud ERP system, specifically the "Personnel Workbench".
- **HR Personnel Account:**  The attacker needs to have a legitimate HR personnel account to perform the attack.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **HR Role:** The attacker must have an HR staff account with access to the "Personnel Workbench".
- **Knowledge of the System:** The attacker needs knowledge of how to use the “Personnel Workbench” to modify the user data and how to trigger a password reset.
