Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from an out-of-bounds write in the `nix::unistd::getgrouplist` function within the `nix` crate for Rust.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities:**

- **Out-of-bounds write:** The `nix::unistd::getgrouplist` function calls the libc's `getgrouplist` function with a buffer that is too small, leading to an out-of-bounds write.
- **Incorrect buffer resizing:** While the `nix::unistd::getgrouplist` function attempts to resize the buffer when it's too small, it fails to correctly update the `ngroups` parameter. This parameter is an in/out value that some libc implementations (like glibc and Solaris libc) modify to reflect the number of groups. This inconsistency leads to subsequent calls to `getgrouplist` writing beyond the allocated buffer.

**Impact of exploitation:**

- **Memory corruption:** The out-of-bounds write can cause memory corruption.

**Attack vectors:**

- **User with many groups:** The vulnerability is triggered when a user has more than 16 group memberships.
- **Dependency:** The vulnerable code exists in the `nix` crate, and applications using this crate are susceptible.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- **Ability to manipulate group memberships:**  Exploitation requires a user to have more than 16 group memberships, which typically involves editing `/etc/groups`. Since `/etc/groups` is usually only editable by the root user, this significantly limits exploitability.
- **Use of vulnerable nix crate versions:** An application must be using one of the vulnerable versions of the `nix` crate (>= 0.16.0, < 0.20.2 or >= 0.21.0, < 0.21.2 or >= 0.22.0, < 0.22.2) to be affected.

**Summary**

The vulnerability lies in how `nix::unistd::getgrouplist` handles the libc's `getgrouplist` function, specifically regarding buffer resizing and the `ngroups` parameter. This can be exploited by having a user with a large number of group memberships, leading to memory corruption due to an out-of-bounds write.

**Additional Note:**
The advisory also mentions that this vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-45707, however the CVE description mentions "PLACEHOLDER - Implement CVE description retrieval".
