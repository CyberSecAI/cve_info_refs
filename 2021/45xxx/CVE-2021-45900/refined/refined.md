Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The root cause is **improper API authentication**. Certain APIs in the Vivoh application could be executed without proper authentication, relying only on the `VIVOH_USERNAME` cookie instead of the required `VIVOH_AUTH` cookie.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Insecure Direct Object References (IDOR):** Although not explicitly stated in the content, the ability to manipulate resources via API calls without proper authentication indicates a potential IDOR vulnerability.
*   **Missing Authentication:** The core issue is the failure to validate the presence of the `VIVOH_AUTH` cookie for sensitive API endpoints. The system incorrectly allows requests to proceed based only on the `VIVOH_USERNAME` cookie.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   **Impersonation:** An attacker could impersonate a victim user.
*   **State Changes:** Attackers could make state-changing requests on behalf of a victim, leading to unauthorized modification of data or system resources.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   **Direct API Manipulation:** An attacker can craft API requests (POST, PUT, DELETE) to the vulnerable endpoints (/api/source/, /api/rule/, /api/config/) and omit the required `VIVOH_AUTH` cookie.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Vivoh application's server.
*   **Knowledge of the API Endpoints:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable API endpoints.
*   **Valid `VIVOH_USERNAME` Cookie (for a user):** The attacker needs a valid `VIVOH_USERNAME` cookie, which they could obtain from their own account or potentially another method.

**Summary of Vulnerable APIs:**

*   `POST, PUT, DELETE` requests to `/api/source/`
*   `POST, PUT, DELETE` requests to `/api/rule/`
*   `PUT` requests to `/api/config/`

**Remediation:**

*   **Server-Side Authentication Check:** The server-side code must be modified to verify the presence of the valid `VIVOH_AUTH` cookie before processing requests to sensitive API endpoints.
*   **Invalidate Auth Cookie on Logout:** The `VIVOH_AUTH` cookie should be invalidated when a user logs out to prevent its misuse.

**Additional Notes:**
* The document includes detailed steps to reproduce the vulnerability using a cURL command and provides screenshots of the Burp Suite request/response and the application's UI. It also provides proof of the fix.
* The information provided is more detailed than a standard CVE description and includes a practical demonstration of the vulnerability and its remediation.
