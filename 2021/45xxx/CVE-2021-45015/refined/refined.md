{
  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability lies in the `taocms\\include\\Model\\file.php` file, specifically in the logic from line 60 to 72. The code attempts to delete a folder if it's empty, and if it is not empty it will not delete. The issue is it does not properly filter or validate the file path and allows directory traversal using `../`.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Improper path traversal validation.",
      "Lack of proper file path sanitization"
    ],
    "impact": "Arbitrary file deletion. An attacker can delete any file on the server where the webserver has write access.",
    "attack_vectors": "By manipulating the file path input in the file management function to include directory traversal sequences like `../`.",
        "required_capabilities": "The attacker needs access to the file management functionality in the taocms backend. They also require knowledge of the file system structure."
