The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability and is relevant to CVE-2021-45614.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a pre-authentication command injection flaw. This means an attacker can inject and execute commands on the affected device without needing to log in or authenticate first.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Pre-authentication command injection

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Attackers can execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices, potentially leading to:
    - Full compromise of the device
    - Data theft
    - Installation of malware
    - Denial of service (DoS)
    - Other malicious actions

**Attack Vectors:**
- The vulnerability is network-based (AV:A), meaning the attacker must have network access to the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to have adjacent network access (AV:A) to the vulnerable device.
- No user interaction (UI:N) is required.
- No authentication (PR:N) is needed, as the vulnerability is pre-authentication.
- The attack impacts the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of the device (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**CVSS Vector and Score:**
- CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
- CVSS Score: 9.6 (Critical)
