The provided content is related to a security advisory for a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router, extender, and WiFi system models. While the advisory does not explicitly mention CVE-2021-45621, it describes a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability which is likely the same vulnerability assigned CVE-2021-45621.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
* Pre-authentication command injection vulnerability

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
* Command injection: An attacker can inject arbitrary commands that will be executed on the device's operating system.
* Pre-authentication: The vulnerability can be exploited without requiring prior authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:**
* The attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices, which could lead to:
    * Full compromise of the device
    * Data exfiltration
    * Denial of service
    * Installation of malware
    * Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
* The attack can be performed remotely over the network as it is a pre-authentication vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
* The attacker needs to be on the same network or have the ability to send crafted network packets to the vulnerable device.
* No user interaction or prior authentication is required.
