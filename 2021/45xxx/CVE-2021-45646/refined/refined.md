The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a sensitive information disclosure vulnerability, though it does not explicitly mention a CVE ID. It references vulnerability **PSV-2020-0174** affecting the R7000 router. Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The advisory states that there is a "sensitive information disclosure security vulnerability" on the R7000 router. However, it does not describe the technical details of the vulnerability or the specific mechanism that enables information disclosure.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Sensitive Information Disclosure: The core weakness is the exposure of sensitive information. The type of information is not specified.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The advisory states the impact as medium, with a CVSS score of 4.3 and a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N.
- The vulnerability allows for a low impact on confidentiality, with no impact on integrity or availability. This indicates the attacker could potentially view sensitive data.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is network-based, as indicated by the CVSS vector's AV:N. This suggests a remote attack is possible through the network.
- The CVSS vector shows low attack complexity (AC:L), no privileges required (PR:N) and no user interaction required (UI:N)

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to be on the network (likely remotely) and does not need any special user privileges. No user interaction is required for a successful exploit.
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the vulnerable device

**Additional Details:**
