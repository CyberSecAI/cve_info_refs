Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45293:

**Root Cause:**
The vulnerability stems from an invalid memory address dereference within the `wasm::WasmBinaryBuilder::visitLet` function. Specifically, the code attempts to access memory at an address calculated using `rdx + 0x38`, where `rdx` could potentially be an invalid pointer, leading to a segmentation fault.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **Invalid Memory Access:** The core weakness is the possibility of dereferencing an invalid memory address. The code does not properly validate the pointer `rdx` before accessing the memory location.
- **Lack of Pointer Validation:** The code doesn't implement necessary checks to ensure the validity of pointers before using them.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** Successful exploitation results in a segmentation fault, causing the program (`wasm-dis`) to crash. This leads to a denial of service by preventing users from using the affected functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Crafted WebAssembly Binary:** The vulnerability can be triggered by processing a specially crafted WebAssembly binary. The attacker must supply a malicious WASM file that results in the vulnerable code path to be taken.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Ability to Provide Input:** The attacker needs to be able to provide a malicious WebAssembly binary as input to the `wasm-dis` tool.
- **Understanding of WASM Structure:**  The attacker would need some level of understanding of WebAssembly binary structure to craft a file that triggers the vulnerability.

**Additional details from the provided content:**

- The issue was discovered in `binaryen` version 103.
- The crash occurs in `wasm::WasmBinaryBuilder::visitLet`, which is part of processing a WASM file.
- The vulnerability was fixed in version 105 of `binaryen`
- The `WasmBinaryBuilder::visitLet` method is called during the parsing of a `let` instruction.
- The fix was included in Fedora updates for versions 34 and 35.
