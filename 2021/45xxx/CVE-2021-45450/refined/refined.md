Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability information related to CVE-2021-45450:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `psa_cipher_generate_iv()` and `psa_cipher_encrypt()` functions within the Mbed TLS library.
- Specifically, these functions were reading back from the output buffer.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Policy bypass or decryption oracle:** The vulnerability allows for a potential policy bypass or the creation of a decryption oracle. This is due to the function reading back from the output buffer.
- **Shared memory vulnerability:** The risk is amplified if the output buffer resides in memory shared with an untrusted application, making it easier to exploit the vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Decryption oracle:** An attacker might be able to decrypt ciphertext by observing the behavior of the vulnerable functions, especially if they have a way to manipulate the input or observe the output.
- **Policy bypass:** The incorrect handling of the output buffer could lead to bypassing intended security policies in how the cryptographic operations were designed to be used.
- **Man-in-the-middle attacks:** Specifically in a DTLS connection, an attacker could inject fake cipher text.

**Attack vectors:**
- An attacker needs to control or observe the output buffer used in the vulnerable cryptographic operations
- Memory disclosure vulnerabilities that could leak the intermediate values used to calculate the MAC/AEAD tag, which could then be used to inject fake ciphertext.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs the capability to interact with or influence the memory locations used by the vulnerable functions and potentially needs to be in a man-in-the-middle position.

**Additional notes:**

- The fix implemented in Mbed TLS 2.28.1 (and 3.1.0) addresses this by ensuring that these functions do not read back from the output buffer.
- This vulnerability is related to CVE-2021-45451, which is fixed by the same action, where the issue is with the function `psa_aead_generate_nonce()`.
