{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability lies in the lack of proper input sanitization when handling the 'skin' parameter, which allows for directory traversal.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present": "Directory traversal vulnerability.",
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can achieve arbitrary file inclusion by manipulating the 'skin' parameter, potentially leading to arbitrary code execution, disclosure of sensitive information or other malicious actions.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through HTTP requests, by modifying the 'skin' parameter in the request line.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to intercept and modify HTTP requests and have the ability to upload files to the server hosting the application. The files do not need to be uploaded to the application directory as they can be included using directory traversal."
