- **Root cause of vulnerability:** A buggy AVX2-accelerated backend was introduced in version 0.9.7 of the `sha2` crate.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The AVX2 backend miscomputed SHA2 results for long messages that span multiple SHA blocks.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Incorrect hash values are generated, which can lead to various security issues, depending on the application using the SHA2 library (e.g., data integrity issues, authentication bypass).
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered automatically on x86/x86_64 CPUs with AVX2 support when using the affected `sha2` crate version (0.9.7).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker does not need any special capabilities or positions, other than to have the affected software (using the vulnerable library) execute on a vulnerable CPU.

The provided information gives more detail than the official CVE description, specifying the affected software and the specific cause of the vulnerability, including which CPU types are impacted.
