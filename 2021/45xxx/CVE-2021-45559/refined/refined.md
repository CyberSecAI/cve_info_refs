The provided content is related to a security advisory for a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, which is relevant to understanding CVE-2021-45559. While the advisory itself does not explicitly mention CVE-2021-45559, it does detail a command injection vulnerability affecting specific Netgear products, which is likely the vulnerability being tracked.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- Post-authentication command injection vulnerability exists in the firmware of the affected Netgear products.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: An attacker, after successfully authenticating, can inject commands to be executed by the system.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Full compromise of the device (Confidentiality, Integrity, Availability) is possible given the CVSS score provided.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is network-based ("AV:A"), requiring the attacker to be on the same network as the target device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must have valid administrator credentials to the device ("PR:H").
- The attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected device.

**Affected product models and firmware versions:**
- RBK752, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
- RBR750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
- RBS750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
- RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
- RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
- RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6

**Additional Notes:**
- The provided CVSS vector is CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H, indicating the vulnerability has a high impact when exploited successfully.
- The advisory mentions that NETGEAR has released firmware fixes to address the vulnerability.

This information provides a good understanding of the vulnerability, its impact, and the necessary steps to mitigate it.
