Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45341:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability lies in the `CDataMoji` entity deserialization within the `jwwlib` library of LibreCAD, specifically in the `CDataMoji::Serialize()` function. A fixed-size buffer `buf` of 512 bytes is allocated on the stack. The size of data being copied into the buffer is determined by data from the input file, without any bounds check being performed prior to the copy. This allows for a buffer overflow if an attacker provides a size larger than 512 bytes through the crafted JWW file.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The core issue is a stack buffer overflow due to the lack of bounds checking. The `CDataMoji::Serialize()` function copies data into a fixed-size stack buffer without validating if the size of data exceeds the capacity of the buffer.
*   **Missing bounds check:** Specifically on `MojiData2` (line 523 of jwwdoc.h). The code reads size from the input file and uses it without validation.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** By overflowing the buffer, an attacker can overwrite stack variables, including the return address. This allows the attacker to control the execution flow and execute arbitrary code on the system running LibreCAD, with the privileges of the current user.
*   **Crash/Denial of Service (DoS):**  The overflow can cause a crash due to an access violation, making the application unusable.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **Malicious JWW file:** The attack vector is a crafted JW-CAD input file containing an oversized `CDataMoji` field. An attacker would need to get a user to open the malicious file with LibreCAD.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Ability to create/modify JWW files:** The attacker needs to create or modify a JWW file such that it contains an overly long `CDataMoji` field.
*   **Ability to deliver the JWW file to a victim:** The attacker must be able to deliver the crafted JWW file to a user who will then open the file with LibreCAD.
*   **No special permissions needed on the target system:** The attacker will execute arbitrary code with the same privileges as the victim user.

**Additional Details:**

*   The vulnerability was found in LibreCAD versions 2.2.0-rc3 and older, as well as Jw_cad 8.24a and older.
*   The provided proof of concept (PoC) file specifically targeted the Windows release but also affects other versions and platforms.
*   Mitigation was proposed as bounds checking in `CDataMoji::Serialize()`, refusing to load files that would cause a buffer overflow.
*   A fix was implemented by truncating oversized CDataMoji fields to 511 bytes and silently ignoring any extra data.
*   The vulnerability was assigned CVE-2021-45341.
*   This vulnerability was addressed in later releases of LibreCAD in Fedora, Debian and Gentoo, specifically in librecad-2.2.0-0.15.rc4.fc35, version 2.1.3-1.2+deb10u1 and version 2.1.3-r7 respectively.
