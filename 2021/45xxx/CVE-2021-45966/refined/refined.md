Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45966:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

The vulnerability is a command injection flaw within a scheduled task script in the pascom Cloud Phone System (CPS). Specifically, the `tsk050380` task script takes user-provided input for the `$targetdir` parameter and uses it unsanitized in an `rm -rf` command, allowing for arbitrary command execution.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **Command Injection:** The primary weakness is the direct use of the user-supplied `$targetdir` parameter in a system command without proper sanitization or escaping, leading to command injection.
*   **Insecure Task Handling:** The system does not properly validate or sanitize task parameters before execution, making it vulnerable to command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** An attacker can achieve remote code execution as root within the LXC container running the pascom application. Due to the nature of the application and the way it handles tasks, this can lead to gaining full control of the system and further exploitation.
*   **System Takeover:** This RCE can lead to a complete compromise of the affected pascom CPS instance, including the potential to access and manipulate sensitive data or use the system as a foothold for further attacks.

**Attack vectors:**

*   **REST API:** The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted JSON request to the `/services/apply` REST API endpoint, scheduling the vulnerable task with malicious arguments.
*   **Chained Exploitation:** To reach the vulnerable endpoint, the attacker needs to combine multiple vulnerabilities
     1. Path Traversal (CVE-2021-45968): to access the `/services/apply` API endpoint.
     2. SSRF (CVE-2021-45967): to retrieve the password required to access the API.
   
**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   **Network Access:** The attacker must be able to send HTTP requests to the pascom CPS instance.
*   **Exploitation Chain:** The attacker needs to exploit the path traversal vulnerability to access internal endpoints, the SSRF vulnerability to obtain valid credentials, and finally the command injection to achieve RCE.
* **Authentication:** Although the vulnerability exists post-authentication, an unauthenticated attacker can leverage the SSRF vulnerability (CVE-2021-45967) to obtain the necessary credentials to exploit this issue.

**Additional details:**

* The `exd.pl` daemon, running as root, executes the scheduled tasks.
* The vulnerable task script is `tsk050380`.
* The vulnerability is in the `perform()` method of the task where the `$targetdir` parameter is used directly in the `rm -rf` command.
* The issue is present in pascom CPS versions <= 7.19, and has been fixed in versions 7.20.x and later.

In summary, CVE-2021-45966 is a critical command injection vulnerability within the pascom CPS scheduled task functionality which, when combined with other vulnerabilities, allows a remote unauthenticated attacker to gain root level RCE, leading to full system compromise.
