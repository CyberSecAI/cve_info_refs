- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `rdiff` library uses the return value of a `Read` instance to set the length of its internal character vector. If the `Read` implementation claims to have read more bytes than the length of the provided buffer, the vector's length is set beyond its capacity.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability is a memory exposure issue. Specifically, the library's internal character vector's length can be set beyond its actual allocated capacity. This leads to accessing uninitialized memory when the vector is read.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Exploitation results in the `rdiff` APIs returning uninitialized memory. This could expose sensitive information or lead to unpredictable behavior due to the use of uninitialized memory.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can provide a malicious `Read` implementation that returns a number of bytes larger than the buffer provided. This input would trigger the vulnerability and cause the library to return uninitialized memory.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to control or influence the `Read` instance used by `rdiff`. This could occur if `rdiff` is reading from a source controlled by the attacker, or if the attacker can influence what implementation is used in the library's configuration.
