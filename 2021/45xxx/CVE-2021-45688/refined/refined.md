- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `util::read_spv()` function in the `ash` crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided `Read` implementation.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - **Memory Exposure:** A user-provided `Read` implementation can read from the uninitialized buffer, potentially exposing sensitive data.
    - **Undefined Behavior:** Reading from uninitialized memory can result in undefined values and invoke undefined behavior.
    - **Incorrect byte count:** User-provided Read implementations can return an incorrect number of bytes written to the buffer
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Memory exposure: Arbitrary read implementations can read from the uninitialized buffer and expose its content.
    - Undefined behavior: Can lead to unpredictable application behavior and crashes.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - An attacker can provide a malicious `Read` implementation that exploits the uninitialized buffer.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be able to provide a custom implementation of the `Read` trait to the vulnerable function.
