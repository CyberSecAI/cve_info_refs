Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of the vulnerability:

**CVE ID:** CVE-2021-45392

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a stack buffer overflow in the `sub_422CE4` function.
- The function uses `strcpy` to copy data from the `prefixDelegate` parameter into a stack buffer without proper bounds checking.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Stack Buffer Overflow:** The `strcpy` function is used to copy the `prefixDelegate` parameter into a fixed-size buffer on the stack without checking the size of the input, leading to a buffer overflow.
- **Lack of Input Validation:** The `prefixDelegate` parameter from the HTTP request is used directly without any size validation.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service (DoS):** A successful exploitation of the vulnerability can lead to a denial of service. By sending a crafted `prefixDelegate` parameter that exceeds the buffer size, the attacker can overwrite critical data on the stack and cause a crash.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP POST Request:** The attack is performed by sending a crafted POST request to `/goform/setIPv6Status` with a long value in the `prefixDelegate` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs network access to the Tenda router's web interface.
- **Knowledge of the Vulnerable Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the vulnerable URL endpoint (`/goform/setIPv6Status`) and the vulnerable parameter (`prefixDelegate`).

**Additional Details:**
- The vulnerable function `sub_422CE4` copies the input parameter to the stack using `strcpy`.
- The vulnerable parameter is `prefixDelegate`.
- The vulnerability affects the Tenda AX12 router, specifically firmware version V22.03.01.21_CN.
