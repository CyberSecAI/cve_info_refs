Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45100:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

The root cause is an incorrect implementation of the SMB2 protocol in the ksmbd (kernel SMB server) module of the Linux kernel. Specifically, the `SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION` flag, which should only be used for SMB 3.0 and 3.0.2 dialects, is mistakenly set for SMB 3.1.1 connections. This violates the official Microsoft MS-SMB2 specification.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Protocol Violation:** The ksmbd module incorrectly sets the `SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION` flag for SMB 3.1.1, which is a violation of the MS-SMB2 specification.
-   **Incorrect Capability Negotiation:** This incorrect flag setting leads Windows clients to detect an anomaly in the negotiation and disable encryption despite being explicitly enabled on the server side.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   **Plaintext Data Transmission:** The most significant impact is that data transfers between a client (e.g., Windows 10) and the vulnerable ksmbd server occur in plain text, exposing sensitive information.
-  **Disabled Encryption:** The Windows client disables encryption entirely due to the protocol violation, overriding the desired encryption settings.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The vulnerability is triggered during the SMB2 negotiation process when a client attempts to establish an encrypted connection with an SMB server using the 3.1.1 dialect.
-  The attacker isn't directly involved in the exploitation of this vulnerability, but an attacker on the network could eavesdrop on communications because the encryption is disabled.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   **Eavesdropping:** An attacker must be positioned on the network where the vulnerable SMB connection is established.
-   **Passive role:** The attacker does not actively participate in the exploitation of this vulnerability; it is enough to simply observe the unencrypted network traffic.
-   The attacker does not need any credentials or special capabilities.

**Additional Notes:**

-   The provided content, especially the discussion on github.com, gives more details on the vulnerability than the official CVE description.
-   The content explains that the `SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION` flag is meant for use only with SMB 3.0 and 3.0.2 dialects, and that SMB 3.1.1 uses the `cipher_type` field for encryption negotiation.
-   The content also details a code fix for the vulnerability that involves removing the incorrect setting of the flag and adding a new function `should_encrypt()` to check if a connection should be encrypted. The function checks both `SMB2_GLOBAL_CAP_ENCRYPTION` and `cipher_type` for proper determination.
-   The NetApp advisory confirms the vulnerability's presence in their products' Linux Kernel and that it could lead to the disclosure of sensitive information, specifically affecting their HCI Baseboard Management Controllers (BMC).
-   The NetApp advisory also notes that there are no workarounds and also indicates that they do not have plans to address the vulnerability for some of their affected products.
