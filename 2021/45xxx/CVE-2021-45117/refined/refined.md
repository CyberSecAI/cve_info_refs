Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45117:

**Root Cause:**

The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the autogenerated ANSI C stack stubs of the OPC UA ANSIC Stack (also referred to as the Legacy C-Stack). Specifically, it occurs when an unexpected OPC UA Response message status code is received by a client through the synchronous Client API. This results in a null pointer dereference.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **CWE-476: NULL Pointer Dereference:** The core vulnerability is that the code attempts to dereference a null pointer when an unexpected status code is encountered in a response message. This leads to a crash.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Denial of Service (DoS):** The primary impact is a crash of the OPC UA application or component utilizing the vulnerable stack. This can lead to a denial of service, interrupting critical operations of industrial equipment.
- The vulnerability affects clients, and may affect a server if it is using  `OpcUa_ClientApi_RegisterServer` (e.g., when registering at LDS).

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Malicious Server:** A specially crafted OPC UA server can send response messages with unexpected status codes, triggering the vulnerability in connected clients.
- **Man-in-the-Middle (MitM) Attack:** An attacker intercepting and manipulating network traffic can inject malicious response messages to induce a crash.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- The attacker needs to be able to either act as a malicious OPC UA server or have the ability to manipulate network traffic between a client and server.
- The vulnerability is triggered when a client is connected to the malicious server. The client must process the manipulated messages from the malicious server.
- No special privileges on the target system are required by the attacker, but network access to the target is necessary.

**Additional Notes:**

- The vulnerability exists in the generated code of the OPC Foundation C-Stack.
- Siemens products using the affected stack are vulnerable.
- The vulnerability is exploitable in both client and server roles, depending on the client/server API usage.
- The vulnerability can be triggered by sending "uncertain status code in response message".
- The vendor considers the severity to be medium, and gave the vulnerability a CVSS score of 6.5.
