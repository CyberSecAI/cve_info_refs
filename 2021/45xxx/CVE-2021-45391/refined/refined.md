Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45391:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- A stack buffer overflow vulnerability exists in the `sub_422CE4` function within the Tenda AX12 router's firmware.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The `strcpy` function is used to copy data from the `conType` parameter into a stack buffer without proper bounds checking.
- The `conType` parameter is taken directly from user input without validation or sanitization.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- A successful exploit of this vulnerability leads to a denial-of-service (DoS) attack. This is achieved by overflowing the stack buffer, causing the device to crash or become unresponsive.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability can be triggered via an HTTP POST request to the `/goform/setIPv6Status` endpoint.
- The attacker needs to include a specially crafted, long string in the `conType` parameter of the request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the Tenda router's web interface. This could be from the local network or, potentially, from the internet if the web interface is exposed.
- No special authentication seems to be required to trigger the vulnerability.

**Additional Details**
- The affected Tenda AX12 router firmware version is V22.03.01.21\_CN (latest version at time of reporting).
- The vulnerability was reported to CVE and CNVD on 2021-12-19.
