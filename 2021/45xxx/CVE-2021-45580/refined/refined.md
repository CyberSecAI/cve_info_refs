The provided content is a security advisory for a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, identified as PSV-2020-0088, affecting several NETGEAR Orbi WiFi systems. Although the advisory does not have an associated CVE ID, it provides details about the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection flaw. This means that after a user successfully logs in to the device, they can inject and execute arbitrary operating system commands.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Command Injection: The primary weakness is the lack of proper sanitization or validation of user-supplied input within a post-authentication context.

**Impact of exploitation:**
-  Full System Compromise: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device, potentially leading to complete control of the device, including data exfiltration, configuration changes, denial of service, and further network attacks.
-  Data Breach: Attackers can potentially gain access to sensitive data handled by the compromised system.

**Attack vectors:**
- Network Access: The attacker requires network access to the device's management interface.
- Authentication: The attacker needs valid credentials to log in to the device before exploiting the vulnerability.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local Network Access: The attacker must be on the same network or have a way to reach the management interface of the vulnerable device.
- Valid Credentials: The attacker must have valid user credentials to log in to the device's administration panel.

**Affected product models:**
- RBK752
- RBR750
- RBS750
- RBK852
- RBR850
- RBS850

**Vulnerable firmware versions:**
Firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6 are vulnerable.

The advisory recommends updating to the latest firmware to address this vulnerability.
