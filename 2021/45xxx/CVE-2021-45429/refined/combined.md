The dereferece operation after this will read 64bits from src.     [yara/libyara/libyara.c](https://github.com/VirusTotal/yara/blob/605b2edf07ed8eb9a2c61ba22eb2e7c362f47ba7/libyara/libyara.c#L381-L403)  Lines 381 to 403 in [605b2ed](/VirusTotal/yara/commit/605b2edf07ed8eb9a2c61ba22eb2e7c362f47ba7)   |  | YR\_API int yr\_set\_configuration(YR\_CONFIG\_NAME name, void \*src) | | --- | --- | |  | { | |  | if (src == NULL) | |  | return ERROR\_INTERNAL\_FATAL\_ERROR; | |  |  | |  | switch (name) | |  | { // lump all the cases using same types together in one cascade | |  | case YR\_CONFIG\_STACK\_SIZE: | |  | case YR\_CONFIG\_MAX\_STRINGS\_PER\_RULE: | |  | case YR\_CONFIG\_MAX\_MATCH\_DATA: | |  | yr\_cfgs[name].ui32 = \*(uint32\_t \*) src; | |  | break; | |  |  | |  | case YR\_CONFIG\_MAX\_PROCESS\_MEMORY\_CHUNK: | |  | yr\_cfgs[name].ui64 = \*(uint64\_t \*) src; | |  | break; | |  |  | |  | default: | |  | return ERROR\_INTERNAL\_FATAL\_ERROR; | |  | } | |  |  | |  | return ERROR\_SUCCESS; | |  | } |      Note that, in cli/yara.c, a pointer to the 32bit integer `max_process_memory_chunk` is passed to `yr_set_configuration`. As a result, `yr_cfgs[name].ui64 = *(uint64_t *) src;` will read 64bits from a 32bit variable. This caused the ERROR reported by ASAN.
