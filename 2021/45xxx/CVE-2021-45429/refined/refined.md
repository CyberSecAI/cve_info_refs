- **Root cause of vulnerability:**  The vulnerability is caused by an insecure pointer conversion in the `yr_set_configuration()` function. Specifically, when setting the `YR_CONFIG_MAX_PROCESS_MEMORY_CHUNK` configuration, the code treats a `void* src` pointer as a `uint64_t*`, while in the calling function `cli/yara.c`, a pointer to a 32bit integer `max_process_memory_chunk` is passed. This results in reading 64 bits from a 32 bit variable.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Type confusion/insecure pointer conversion leading to a global-buffer-overflow.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Reading beyond the bounds of the allocated memory for the 32-bit variable, potentially leading to arbitrary memory access. An attacker who gains control of the memory adjacent to `max_process_memory_chunk` could set the higher 32 bits of `yr_cfgs[name].ui64` to arbitrary values.

- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector involves setting the `YR_CONFIG_MAX_PROCESS_MEMORY_CHUNK` configuration with a pointer to an insufficiently sized memory location causing `yr_set_configuration` to read out-of-bounds data.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the configuration settings, specifically the `YR_CONFIG_MAX_PROCESS_MEMORY_CHUNK` value, by providing a pointer to a 32-bit variable, while the code attempts to dereference it as a 64-bit value.
