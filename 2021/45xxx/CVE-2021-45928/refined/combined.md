### @jonsneyers **[jonsneyers](/jonsneyers)** commented [Jul 26, 2021](#issue-953040008)

Some fixes to the case where the full modular image is skipped:

* don't assume that everything happens at the modular AC group level (`minShift==0`), there can also be upsampling causing channels to have nonzero shift even when there's no Squeeze
* for partial decodes (when `zerofill` is true), don't try to fill the full image when it's not used. Instead initialize the decoded image with zeroes and skip the decoding.

Sorry, something went wrong.

### This comparison is taking too long to generate.

Unfortunately it looks like we can’t render this comparison for you right now. It might be too big, or there might be something weird with your repository.

You can try running this command locally to see the comparison on your machine:

`git diff v0.5...v0.6`

| Jon it looks like you are using CRASH\_ON\_ERROR, which we don't have enabled in release mode and don't expect users to have.  The linked file is from a different fuzzer than our djxl\_fuzzer, so it is probably easier to reproduce with djxl or decode\_oneshot. I managed to do that with an asan build following the instructions in our doc but building decode\_oneshot instead of djxl\_fuzzer. |

| [@jonsneyers](https://github.com/jonsneyers) I checked and it's the right reproducer.  I did a little digging and it's a 86 x 72 pixel image, with 1 colour channel and 2 extra channels. This is a case (I think?) that djxl does not handle, so it rejects the image before attempting decode.  libvips supports any number of alphas, so it tries to decode it as GAA, and this triggers the failure.  You can reproduce with the libvips decoder like this:  ``` $ valgrind vips copy clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-5454144264601600.jxl x.v ==683866== Memcheck, a memory error detector ==683866== Copyright (C) 2002-2017, and GNU GPL'd, by Julian Seward et al. ==683866== Using Valgrind-3.17.0 and LibVEX; rerun with -h for copyright info ==683866== Command: vips copy clusterfuzz-testcase-minimized-5454144264601600.jxl x.v ==683866==  ==683866== Thread 17: ==683866== Invalid write of size 4 ==683866==    at 0x5B84473: jxl::ModularFrameDecoder::DecodeGroup(jxl::Rect const&, jxl::BitReader*, int, int, jxl::ModularStreamId const&, bool, jxl::PassesDecoderState*, jxl::ImageBundle*) (in /home/john/vips/lib/libjxl.so.0.5.0) ==683866==    by 0x5B4DAA1: jxl::FrameDecoder::ProcessACGroup(unsigned long, jxl::BitReader* restrict*, unsigned long, unsigned long, bool, bool) (in /home/john/vips/lib/libjxl.so.0.5.0) ==683866==    by 0x5B4DC6D: jxl::ThreadPool::RunCallState<jxl::FrameDecoder::ProcessSections(jxl::FrameDecoder::SectionInfo const*, unsigned long, jxl::FrameDecoder::SectionStatus*)::{lambda(unsigned long)#2}, jxl::FrameDecoder::ProcessSections(jxl::FrameDecoder::SectionInfo const*, unsigned long, jxl::FrameDecoder::SectionStatus*)::{lambda(unsigned long, unsigned long)#3}>::CallDataFunc(void*, unsigned int, unsigned long) (in /home/john/vips/lib/libjxl.so.0.5.0) ==683866==    by 0x5AA8337: jpegxl::ThreadParallelRunner::RunRange(jpegxl::ThreadParallelRunner*, unsigned long, int) (in /home/john/vips/lib/libjxl_threads.so.0.5.0) ==683866==    by 0x5AA842F: jpegxl::ThreadParallelRunner::ThreadFunc(jpegxl::ThreadParallelRunner*, int) (in /home/john/vips/lib/libjxl_threads.so.0.5.0) ...  ```  Of course perhaps this is such a strange case that it's not worth fixing. Should libvips reject JXL with `num_extra_channels` > 1? It might be useful to support it for scientific imaging, where many alphas are quite common. |

| [@jcupitt](https://github.com/jcupitt) [#365](https://github.com/libjxl/libjxl/pull/365) should address this one. We want to support multiple extra channels so this should be fixed in libjxl anyway. |
