The provided content is related to an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting certain NETGEAR WiFi systems, but it **does not** match CVE-2021-45505 which is a placeholder.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* The document describes an authentication bypass vulnerability but does not explicitly state the root cause.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Authentication bypass vulnerability.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* The advisory indicates that this vulnerability has a "Critical" CVSS rating.
* Exploitation could lead to complete compromise of the affected devices, including:
    * Loss of Confidentiality (C:H)
    * Loss of Integrity (I:H)
    * Loss of Availability (A:H)

**Attack Vectors:**
* The CVSS vector indicates an Adjacent Network (AV:A) attack vector. This means that an attacker needs to be on the same local network segment as the target device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker must be within the adjacent network of the affected NETGEAR device (i.e., same LAN/WLAN).
* No special privileges are required (PR:N).
* No user interaction is required (UI:N).

**Affected Products:**

* RBK752, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
* RBR750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
* RBS750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
* RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
* RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12
* RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.17.12

**Additional Information:**
* The advisory provides a CVSS v3.1 vector string: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
* It also lists steps to update firmware for the affected devices.
* The advisory references PSV-2020-0477, which might be Netgear's internal tracking number for this vulnerability.
