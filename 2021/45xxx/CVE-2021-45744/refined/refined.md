Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The Bludit application does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the "TAGS" field within the admin panel.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The application stores unsanitized JavaScript code in the database. This malicious script is then executed when a user views the page where the tag is displayed, leading to XSS.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the TAGS field of a blog post. When a user views the affected blog post, the attacker's script will execute in the user's browser. This could allow the attacker to:
    - Steal user session cookies.
    - Redirect users to malicious websites.
    - Deface the website.
    - Perform other malicious actions on behalf of the user.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered via the application's admin panel. An authenticated attacker with privileges to create or edit blog posts can inject the malicious payload via the TAGS field.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have an account with the privileges to access the admin panel and create or modify content.
- The attacker needs to navigate to the "Advanced" tab of the new content form to access the "TAGS" field.
- Once the malicious code is inserted in the TAGS field, every user that opens the page will execute the script in their browser
