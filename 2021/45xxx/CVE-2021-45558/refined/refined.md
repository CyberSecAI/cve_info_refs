The provided content is related to a post-authentication command injection vulnerability in NETGEAR Orbi WiFi systems, which is not directly associated with CVE-2021-45558. It corresponds to NETGEAR Security Advisory PSV-2020-0053.

Here's a breakdown of the relevant information:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
* A post-authentication command injection vulnerability exists in specific NETGEAR Orbi WiFi system models.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
* Command injection vulnerability. This means that an attacker, after authenticating to the device, can inject malicious commands that will be executed by the system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
* Successful exploitation could lead to arbitrary command execution on the affected devices. This could result in a complete compromise of the device. The impact is rated as having high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact according to the CVSS vector.

**Attack Vectors:**
* The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
* The attacker needs to have already authenticated to the device (PR:H - high privileges).

**Affected Products and Firmware Versions:**
*   RBK752, RBR750, RBS750, RBK852, RBR850, and RBS850.
*   Firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6 are vulnerable.

**CVSS metrics:**
*   CVSS Score: 8.4
*   CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Mitigation:**
*   Update to firmware version 3.2.16.6 or later.
