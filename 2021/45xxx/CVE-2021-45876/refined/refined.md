Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of CVE-2021-45876:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

*   The `url` parameter within the `downloadAndUpdate` function module of the GARO Wallbox is vulnerable to command injection.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

*   **Unauthenticated Command Injection:** User-supplied input for the `url` parameter is not properly sanitized or validated before being used to generate code for firmware downloads. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

*   An attacker can execute arbitrary commands on the device. This could lead to a variety of malicious activities, including:
    *   Full control of the device.
    *   Modification of device settings.
    *   Installation of malicious firmware.
    *   Disruption of device functionality.

**Attack Vectors:**

*   The vulnerability can be exploited by sending a crafted request to the vulnerable `downloadAndUpdate` function, specifically manipulating the `url` parameter. This appears to be achievable over the network, potentially without authentication.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

*   An attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the GARO Wallbox. They do not need to authenticate to exploit this specific vulnerability. The attacker would need some understanding of the device's API to craft the malicious request.

**Additional Notes:**

*   The advisory mentions that the vulnerability was found on devices with firmware version <=185.
*   The provided documentation includes information on two other related vulnerabilities (CVE-2021-45877, CVE-2021-45878) affecting the same product.
*   The vendor was contacted but did not respond before the advisory was publicly disclosed.
