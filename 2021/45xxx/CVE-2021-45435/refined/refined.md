Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45435:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability stems from the lack of proper sanitization or escaping of user-controlled input within the SQL query in the `Login.php` file of the Simple Cold Storage Management System. Specifically the `$username` variable is directly embedded into the query.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is an SQL injection vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Authentication Bypass:** Attackers can bypass the login authentication to the admin panel, gaining unauthorized administrative access.
- **Database Compromise:** Attackers can extract sensitive information from the database (including user credentials and other sensitive data).
- **Remote Database access:** Remote attackers can extract data from the database using tools such as SQLMap.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the `username` field within the admin login form.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker requires network access to the vulnerable application.
- The attacker does not need prior authentication or specific privileges.

**Additional details:**
- The vulnerable code is located in the `/csms/admin/login.php` file.
- The vulnerable SQL query is: `SELECT * from users where username = '$username' and password = md5('$password')`
- The blog post demonstrates a successful authentication bypass using the following SQL injection payload: `admin'-- -`
- The blog post also demonstrates successful database extraction using SQLMap tool, confirming the SQL injection vulnerability.
