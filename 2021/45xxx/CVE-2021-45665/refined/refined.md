The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

- **Root Cause of Vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a stored XSS issue, meaning malicious scripts can be injected and stored within the device's settings or data, and then executed when other users access that data through a web interface.
- **Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present**: Stored XSS vulnerability.
- **Impact of Exploitation**: Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of other users' browsers, potentially leading to session hijacking, defacement, or other malicious actions.
- **Attack Vectors**: The attack vector is through the web interface of the affected devices.
- **Required Attacker Capabilities/Position**: An attacker needs to be able to inject malicious code through the web interface, likely through a form input or other user-supplied data field, and a user will need to view the infected content, or log into the management interface, for the malicious code to execute. This might require the attacker to have administrative access to the device, depending on the specific vulnerability.

The advisory lists the following affected models and their vulnerable firmware versions:
* EAX20, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.36
* EAX80, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.1.62
* EX3700, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.90
* EX3800, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.90
* EX6120, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.64
* EX6130, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.44
* EX7500, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.72
* RBW30, running firmware versions prior to 2.6.1.4
* RBK752, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBR750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBS750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
* RBS40V, running firmware versions prior to 2.6.1.4

The advisory also provides steps for users to update their firmware to mitigate the vulnerability and includes a CVSS score of 6.5 with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:H/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:H/A:L. This score reflects the attack requires adjacent access, a high level of privileges, and user interaction to be successful, but the scope is changed, and there is a high impact on data integrity.
