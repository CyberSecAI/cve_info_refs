- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The SICAM PQ Analyzer uses an unquoted registry entry to start a service. The path specified in the registry entry contains spaces, which allows for the injection of malicious executables.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Unquoted Search Path vulnerability (CWE-428).
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Attackers might achieve persistence on the system ("backdoors").
    - Attackers might cause a denial of service.
- **Attack vectors**:
    - Attackers with write privileges to directories in the unquoted search path (e.g. "C:\Program Files (x86)\Siemens.*") can plant malicious executables.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: Attackers require write privileges to directories included in the unquoted search path.
