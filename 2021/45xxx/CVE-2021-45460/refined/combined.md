SUMMARY

SICAM PQ Analyzer uses an unquoted registry entry and is thus vulnerable to an unquoted search path
vulnerability.

Siemens has released an update for the SICAM PQ Analyzer and recommends to update to the latest
version.

recommendations from section

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers can apply to
reduce the risk:

• Make sure these executables do not exist, cannot be created or cannot be executed (e.g. by Group

Policy Software Restriction):

– C:\Program.*
– C:\Program Files.*
– C:\Program Files (x86)\Siemens.*
– C:\Program Files (x86)\Siemens Energy\SICAM\PQ.*

Please note that blocking of e.g. “C:\Program.exe” is not sufﬁcient, as the attacker might be able to
plant “C:\Program.com”, “C:\Program.msi” or an executable with any other extension there.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SICAM PQ Analyzer is a power quality system software that provides options to evaluate archived PQ
measuring data and fault records.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45460

A service is started by an unquoted registry entry. As there are spaces in this path, attackers with write
privilege to those directories might be able to plant executables that will run in place of the legitimate
process.

Attackers might achieve persistence on the system (“backdoors”) or cause a denial of service.
