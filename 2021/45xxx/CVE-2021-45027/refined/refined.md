```
{
  "Root cause of vulnerability": "The vulnerability is due to the lack of sanitization of user-supplied input in the `FileServlet` function.",
  "Weaknesses/vulnerabilities": [
    "Arbitrary file download",
    "Unsanitized user input"
  ],
  "Impact of exploitation": "An attacker can download arbitrary files from the server, potentially including sensitive system files, configuration files, or user data.",
  "Attack vectors": "The attack vector is through a crafted URL that includes the `FileServlet` function and a `fileName` parameter containing the path to the desired file.",
  "Required attacker capabilities/position": "The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable server and have knowledge of the file paths on the server to exploit the vulnerability. The attacker does not need prior authentication."
