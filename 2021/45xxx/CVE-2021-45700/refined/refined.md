- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability arises from the ability to create a malicious transaction that uses a dead cell as a `DepGroup` in `DepCells`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability lies in the handling of `DepGroup` references within transactions, specifically when the referenced cell is no longer alive (a dead cell).
- **Impact of exploitation:** A malicious transaction exploiting this vulnerability can crash all receiving nodes that process it.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through crafting and submitting a specially designed transaction.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs the ability to create and submit transactions to the network.
