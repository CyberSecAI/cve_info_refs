- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Unquoted service path in the HIDCCEMonitorSVC software.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**  The service path for HIDCCEMonitorSVC was not enclosed in quotes. This allows an attacker to potentially place a malicious executable in a directory that is part of the service path, leading to the execution of that malicious file by the service.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Local privilege escalation to the system level.
- **Attack vectors:**  A local attacker can exploit this vulnerability.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have local access to the system where the vulnerable software is installed.
