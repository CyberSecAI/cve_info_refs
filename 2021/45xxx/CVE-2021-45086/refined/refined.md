Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45086:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**

- The root cause is the lack of proper output encoding of page titles when displayed in the `about:overview` page of the Epiphany browser. This allows untrusted data (page titles from visited websites) to be directly inserted into the DOM without proper sanitization.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

- **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is XSS. By crafting a website with a malicious payload in its title, an attacker can inject arbitrary JavaScript into the `about:overview` page when the user visits this malicious site.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

- **Bypass Same-Origin Policy (SOP):** The `about:overview` page is considered a privileged page. XSS on this page bypasses the SOP, potentially allowing the attacker to perform actions as if they were the user within the browser's context and gain access to sensitive information.
- **Arbitrary JavaScript Execution:** Successfully exploited XSS can lead to the execution of arbitrary javascript within the context of the vulnerable page, giving an attacker a wide range of potential malicious activities, such as data theft, session hijacking, redirection to other sites and even manipulating the browser itself.

**Attack Vectors:**

- **Visiting a Malicious Website:** The user needs to visit a website that has a malicious payload in its page title.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

- **Website Control:** An attacker needs control of a website and be able to set the site's title to a malicious payload containing javascript code.
- **User Interaction:** The victim must visit the attacker's website at least once in order for it to appear in the vulnerable `about:overview` page.

**Additional Notes:**

- The provided information states that the fix is not about input validation, but rather about missing output encoding which is the proper approach for this type of vulnerability.
- The issue was reported via WebKit Bugzilla.
- The fix was implemented in a merge request.
- Multiple CVEs were addressed in the same merge request (CVE-2021-45085, CVE-2021-45086, CVE-2021-45087, CVE-2021-45088)
- Debian issued a security advisory (DSA-5042-1) to address these vulnerabilities in their `epiphany-browser` package.
