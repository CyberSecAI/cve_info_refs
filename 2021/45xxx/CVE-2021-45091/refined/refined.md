An unspecified vulnerability in SES Evolution allows an authenticated user to forge system logs.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- The vulnerability lies in the way SES Evolution handles system logs, allowing an attacker to inject false log entries.
- The access check can be bypassed by an attacker

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can inject incorrect system logs.
- The vulnerability has low impact on integrity only. No impact on confidentiality and availability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The attacker must have adjacent network access to the target machine
- The attack requires user interaction

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be an authenticated user with low privileges on the machine where the SES Evolution console is installed.
- The attacker needs to trick a user on the machine with the SES console to execute a malicious program.
- The attacker requires adjacent network access to the machine.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability affects SES (Stormshield Endpoint Security) versions 2.1.0 to 2.1.1.
- The issue is fixed in version 2.1.2.
- The CVSS score is low.
