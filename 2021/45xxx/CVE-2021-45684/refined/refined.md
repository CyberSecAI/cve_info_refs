- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `flumedb` crate passes an uninitialized buffer to a user-provided `Read` implementation in two cases: `go_offset_log::read_entry()` and `offset_log::read_entry()`.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Passing an uninitialized buffer to a `Read` implementation allows the implementation to read uninitialized memory. It can also return an incorrect number of bytes written.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Reading from uninitialized memory produces undefined values which can lead to undefined behavior (UB). This can include memory exposure.
- **Attack vectors**: A malicious user-provided `Read` implementation can read from the uninitialized buffer and cause a memory exposure or undefined behavior.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker must be able to provide a custom `Read` implementation which is then used by `flumedb`.
