Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45968:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from URI parsing inconsistencies between Nginx and Tomcat. Nginx and Tomcat interpret the path `/..;/` differently. Nginx treats `/..;/` as a directory, while Tomcat treats it as `/../`, allowing access to unintended endpoints.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Path Traversal: The primary vulnerability is a path traversal issue exploiting the difference in how Nginx and Tomcat handle the `/..;/` sequence in URLs.
- Inconsistent URI Parsing: The core problem is the lack of consistent URI parsing between the Nginx reverse proxy and the Tomcat application server.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Bypassing Access Controls: Attackers can bypass intended access controls and reach servlets or endpoints that were meant to be protected and not directly exposed via the webserver.
- SSRF: This vulnerability in combination with an outdated version of Openfire, can be used to achieve Server Side Request Forgery.
- Information Disclosure: The vulnerability enabled the attacker to access internal information, such as a system user's password by using SSRF.
- Remote Code Execution (RCE): By combining path traversal, SSRF, and a command injection vulnerability, an attacker can achieve full remote code execution as root.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Malicious URL Crafting: The attacker crafts a URL containing the `/..;/` sequence to exploit the path traversal vulnerability.
- HTTP Requests: The attack is carried out by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Network Access: The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable Pascom Cloud Phone System server. No authentication is required for initial exploitation.
- Knowledge of the Vulnerability: The attacker needs to know about the path traversal vulnerability and the target's specific configuration.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided text describes how this path traversal vulnerability can be chained with other vulnerabilities (SSRF and command injection) to achieve pre-authentication remote code execution as root on Pascom systems.
- The vulnerability was present in pascom CPS versions <= 7.19.
- The specific Nginx configuration snippet and how it relates to the exploit was also provided.
- The blog post also covers the remediation timeline of this vulnerability.
