Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45471:

**1. Verification of CVE Relevance:**
   - The bug report from Red Hat Bugzilla ([Bug 2036080](https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2036080)) directly references `CVE-2021-45471`.
   - The bug report summary states: "mediawiki: blocked IP addresses are allowed to edit EntitySchema items".
   - This aligns with the description of CVE-2021-45471 in the provided data.

**2. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
   - The vulnerability stems from MediaWiki's EntitySchema extension failing to properly check for global IP blocks when allowing edits to EntitySchema items.
   - Specifically, the code was only checking local blocks, allowing globally blocked IP addresses to bypass the restriction and edit the item label, description, and aliases.

**3. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
   - **Insufficient Access Control:** The primary vulnerability is the failure to enforce global IP block restrictions on EntitySchema edits.
   - **Bypass of Security Mechanisms:** Globally blocked users are intended to be restricted, but this mechanism is bypassed by the vulnerability.

**4. Impact of Exploitation:**
   - **Unauthorized Modification:** Attackers using globally blocked IP addresses could modify EntitySchema item data.
   - **Data Integrity Concerns:** Unauthorized modifications could potentially lead to data corruption or misinformation within the wikibase.

**5. Attack Vectors:**
   - **Network-based:** The attack vector is through network access to a MediaWiki instance running the vulnerable EntitySchema extension.
   - **IP Address Spoofing:** Attackers would need to use a globally blocked IP address to exploit this vulnerability.

**6. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
   - **Blocked IP Address:** The attacker needs to have their IP address globally blocked on the MediaWiki instance.
   - **Basic HTTP/Web Knowledge:** The attacker needs basic knowledge of web protocols to interact with the MediaWiki interface.
   - **No Authentication Required:** The attacker does not need to be logged in to exploit this vulnerability.

**Additional Details:**
   - The vulnerability was fixed in `mediawiki-1.36.3-1.fc35` as described in the Fedora Update Notification.
   - The fix involved:
        - Replacing `getBlock()` checks with `userCan()` to consider global blocks.
        - Utilizing `PermissionsError` exceptions when appropriate.
        - Applying the fix to `REL1_35`, `REL1_36`, `REL1_37` and `master` branches of the EntitySchema extension.
        - Core patches were also created.
   - Patches are available in the Gerrit code review system for different branches:

   - The vulnerability also affected other parts of the Wikibase extension such as `Special:NewEntitySchema` and other actions (as discovered during the bug fix) and were also patched.

In summary, CVE-2021-45471 is a security vulnerability caused by improper access control in the MediaWiki EntitySchema extension, allowing globally blocked IPs to bypass restrictions and modify data. This was resolved with a patch that properly enforces global IP block restrictions using the `userCan()` function.
