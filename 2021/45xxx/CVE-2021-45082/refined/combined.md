### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

Organizations can choose between GitHub Copilot Business and GitHub Copilot Enterprise. GitHub Copilot Business primarily features GitHub Copilot in the coding environment - that is the IDE, CLI and GitHub Mobile. GitHub Copilot Enterprise includes everything in GitHub Copilot Business. It also  adds an additional layer of customization for organizations and integrates into GitHub.com as a chat interface to allow developers to converse with Copilot  throughout the platform. GitHub Copilot Enterprise can index an organization’s codebase for a deeper understanding of the customer’s knowledge for more tailored suggestions and will offer customers access to fine-tuned custom, private models for code completion.

GitHub Copilot Individual is designed for individual developers, freelancers, students, educators, and open source maintainers. The plan includes all the features of GitHub Copilot Business except organizational license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

GitHub Copilot has multiple offerings for organizations and an offering for individual developers. All the offerings include both code completion and chat assistance. The primary differences between the organization offerings and the individual offering are license management, policy management, and IP indemnity.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

| [Description](show_bug.cgi?id=1193678#c0)  Paolo Perego   2021-12-13 14:27:50 UTC  ``` In templar.py file, function check_for_invalid_imports, ensures that Cheetah code is not importing Python modules. However, the control is very basic and it fires up when line begins with #import:          lines = data.split("\n")         for line in lines:             if line.find("#import") != -1:                 rest = line.replace("#import", "").replace(" ", "").strip()                 if self.settings and rest not in self.settings.cheetah_import_whitelist:                     raise CX("potentially insecure import in template: %s" % rest)                      However, accordingly to Cheetah documentation[1], is it possible to include python code with statement with this syntax:  #from MODULE import MODULE_OR_OBJECT [as NAME] [, ...]  Having a rogue module using #from can bypass import sanitization declared so far.

We have 129 files changed, 6254 insertions(+), 1877 deletions(-)

Milestone: <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/milestone/19>

Diff to last release: [v3.3.2...v3.3.3](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/compare/v3.3.2...v3.3.3)

**Announcements**:

* None

**New**:

* Uyuni Proxies can now be set with the schema validation. [#3061](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3061)
* Cobbler should now build on AlmaLinux. [#3064](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3064)
* The initrd is not required anymore as it is an optional file. [#3127](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3127)
* XML-RPC: Added `dump_vars` endpoint. This is intended to replace `get_blended_data` as of 3.4.0. [#3131](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3131)
* XML-RPC: Added `get_item_resolved_value` ([#3056](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3056)) & `set_item_resolved_value` ([#3134](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3134)) endpoints.

**Breaking Changes**:

* The field `virt_file_size` is now a float and the related settings as well. [#3072](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3072)

**Changes**:

* The error messages for duplicated objects now contains the name of the duplicated object. [#3129](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3129)

**Bugfixes**:

* Dictionaries had the wrong value set for `<<inherit>>` [#3128](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3128)
* There were some cases in which the autoinstallation manager was handed the wrong object and then crashed. [#3130](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3130)
* The inheritance of the `owners` field was fixed. [#3131](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3131)
* Serial Console options should not contain bogous `-1` value anymore. [#3105](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3105)
* HTTP API should not throw permission errors anymore. [#3046](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3046) [#3080](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3080)
* During build the log was not visible due to a custom logger without output. [#3059](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3059)
* `cobbler mkloaders` now also copies dependencies of `menu.c32`. [#3058](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3058)
* We now generate the grub configuration for the architectures correct again. [#3097](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3097)
* `virt_file_size` now is a float at all times. [#3072](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3072)
* Cobbler should restart successfully now if you have attached an image to a system. [#3044](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3044)
* If you have a system named `default` the bootloader was not removed properly before. [#3045](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3045)
* `cobbler buildiso`: The `isolinux.cfg` was not properly formatted. [#3047](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3047)
* There were unharmful templating errors in the log related to `redhat_management_type`. The parts depending on this were removed. [#3048](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3048)
* The DNS managers were non-functional before because of a not existing function call. [#3049](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3049)
* `cobbler buildiso` failed with `--tmpdir`s that don't end in `buildiso`. [#3050](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3050)
* `cobbler buildiso` had outdated docs and help messages for some parameters. [#3051](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3051)
* `cobbler import`: It was impossible to import Rocky Linux 8.5 successfully. [#3052](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3052)
* Cobbler created duplicated settings files before. [#3053](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3053)
* `cobbler sync` was broken by refactoring to `shell=False` before. [#3054](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/3054)

This release got everything! Security, Features, Bugfixes, ...

We have 422 files changed, 25375 insertions(+), 34826 deletions(-)

Milestone: <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/milestone/10>

Diff to last release: [v3.2.1...v3.3.0](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/compare/v3.2.1...v3.3.0)

**Known Issues**:

* `cobbler <item> rename` is not working currently
* `cobbler <item> edit` may have bugs due to the internal refactorings

**Breaking Changes**:

* The webinterface got removed [#2434](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2434) [#2434](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2286) [#2700](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2700)
  + Please use the CLI in the meantime
  + A new webinterface is under development at <https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler-web>
  + The core code has priority at any time. There are third party tools available which provide a webinterface and use

    Cobbler as a backend. A list of those tools can be found at the bottom of the following page: <https://cobbler.github.io/users.html>
* The Cobbler internal TFTP Demon got removed [#2512](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2512)
* `yaboot` support got removed as a bootloader for PowerPC [#2723](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2723)

**Announcements**:

* Important Security Bugfixes [#2794](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/pull/2794) [#2795](https://github.com/cobbler/cobbler/issues/2795)
  + Arbitrary Read was possible through `generate_script()`
  + Arbitrary Write was possible through `upload_log_data()`
  + Log poisoning with Remote-Code-Execution was possible through any XMLRPC method which logs to the logfile.
* There was an internal refactoring from runtime created Python attributes to Python Properties. This allows much

  better data validation and thus better error handling but also introduced new bugs.

## Package

pip

cobbler
([pip](/advisories?query=ecosystem%3Apip))

## Affected versions

< 3.3.1

## Patched versions

3.3.1

## Description

An issue was discovered in Cobbler before 3.3.1. Files in /etc/cobbler are world readable. Two of those files contain some sensitive information that can be exposed to a local user who has non-privileged access to the server. The users.digest file contains the sha2-512 digest of users in a Cobbler local installation. In the case of an easy-to-guess password, it's trivial to obtain the plaintext string. The settings.yaml file contains secrets such as the hashed default password.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.

### @agraul **[agraul](/agraul)** commented [Feb 18, 2022](#issue-1142842731)

Two patches for [CVE-2021-45082](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-6cm4-gm85-972c "CVE-2021-45082") and [CVE-2021-45083](https://github.com/advisories/GHSA-5946-mpw5-pqxx "CVE-2021-45083"). One of them only touches the file permission that are being set up in the spec file, the other tightens the cheetah template sanitization.

Sorry, something went wrong.

# Import, Inheritance, Declaration and Assignment[¶](#import-inheritance-declaration-and-assignment "Permalink to this headline")

## #import and #from directives[¶](#import-and-from-directives "Permalink to this headline")

Syntax:

```
#import MODULE_OR_OBJECT [as NAME] [, ...]
#from MODULE import MODULE_OR_OBJECT [as NAME] [, ...]

```

The {#import} and {#from} directives are used to make external
Python modules or objects available to placeholders. The syntax is
identical to the import syntax in Python. Imported modules are
visible globally to all methods in the generated Python class.

```
#import math
#import math as mathModule
#from math import sin, cos
#from math import sin as _sin
#import random, re
#from mx import DateTime         # ## Part of Egenix's mx package.

```

After the above imports, {$math}, {$mathModule}, {$sin}, {$cos} and
{$\_sin}, {$random}, {$re} and {$DateTime} may be used in
{$placeholders} and expressions.

## #extends[¶](#extends "Permalink to this headline")

Syntax:

```
#extends CLASS

```

All templates are subclasses of {Cheetah.Template.Template}.
However, it’s possible for a template to subclass another template
or a pure Python class. This is where {#extends} steps in: it
specifies the parent class. It’s equivalent to PSP’s
{“@page extends=”} directive.

Cheetah imports the class mentioned in an {#extends} directive
automatically if you haven’t imported it yet. The implicit
importing works like this:

```
#extends Superclass
## Implicitly does '#from Superclass import Superclass'.

#extends Cheetah.Templates.SkeletonPage
## Implicitly does '#from Cheetah.Templates.SkeletonPage import SkeletonPage'.

```

If your superclass is in an unusual location or in a module named
differently than the class, you must import it explicitly. There is
no support for extending from a class that is not imported; e.g.,
from a template dynamically created from a string. Since the most
practical way to get a parent template into a module is to
precompile it, all parent templates essentially have to be
precompiled.

There can be only one {#extends} directive in a template and it may
list only one class. In other words, templates don’t do multiple
inheritance. This is intentional: it’s too hard to initialize
multiple base classes correctly from inside a template. However,
you can do multiple inheritance in your pure Python classes.

If your pure Python class overrides any of the standard {Template}
methods such as {.\_\_init\_\_} or {.awake}, be sure to call the
superclass method in your method or things will break. Examples of
calling the superclass method are in section
tips.callingSuperclassMethods. A list of all superclass methods is
in section tips.allMethods.

In all cases, the root superclass must be {Template}. If your
bottommost class is a template, simply omit the {#extends} in it
and it will automatically inherit from {Template}. { If your
bottommost class is a pure Python class, it must inherit from
{Template} explicitly: }

```
from Cheetah.Template import Template
class MyPurePythonClass(Template):

If you’re not keen about having your Python classes inherit from
{Template}, create a tiny glue class that inherits both from your
class and from {Template}.

Before giving any examples we’ll stress that Cheetah does { not}
dictate how you should structure your inheritance tree. As long as
you follow the rules above, many structures are possible.

Here’s an example for a large web site that has not only a general
site template, but also a template for this section of the site,
and then a specific template-servlet for each URL. (This is the
“inheritance approach” discussed in the Webware chapter.) Each
template inherits from a pure Python class that contains
methods/attributes used by the template. We’ll begin with the
bottommost superclass and end with the specific template-servlet:

```
1.  SiteLogic.py (pure Python class containing methods for the site)
        from Cheetah.Template import Template
        class SiteLogic(Template):

2.  Site.tmpl/py  (template containing the general site framework;
                   this is the template that controls the output,
                   the one that contains "<HTML><HEAD>...", the one
                   that contains text outside any #def/#block.)
        #from SiteLogic import SiteLogic
        #extends SiteLogic
        #implements respond

3.  SectionLogic.py  (pure Python class with helper code for the section)
        from Site import Site
        class SectionLogic(Site)

4.  Section.tmpl/py  (template with '#def' overrides etc. for the section)
        #from SectionLogic import SectionLogic
        #extends SectionLogic

5.  page1Logic.py  (pure Python class with helper code for the template-servlet)
        from Section import Section
        class indexLogic(Section):

6.  page1.tmpl/py  (template-servlet for a certain page on the site)
        #from page1Logic import page1Logic
        #extends page1Logic

```

A pure Python classes might also contain methods/attributes that
aren’t used by their immediate child template, but are available
for any descendant template to use if it wishes. For instance, the
site template might have attributes for the name and e-mail address
of the site administrator, ready to use as $placeholders in any
template that wants it.

{ Whenever you use {#extends}, you often need {#implements} too,}
as in step 2 above. Read the next section to understand what
{#implements} is and when to use it.

## #implements[¶](#implements "Permalink to this headline")

Syntax:

```
#implements METHOD

```

You can call any {#def} or {#block} method directly and get its
outpt. The top-level content - all the text/placeholders/directives
outside any {#def}/{#block} - gets concatenated and wrapped in a
“main method”, by default {.respond()}. So if you call
{.respond()}, you get the “whole template output”. When Webware
calls {.respond()}, that’s what it’s doing. And when you do ‘print
t’ or ‘str(t)’ on a template instance, you’re taking advantage of
the fact that Cheetah makes {.\_\_str\_\_()} an alias for the main
method.

That’s all fine and dandy, but what if your application prefers to
call another method name rather than {.respond()}? What if it wants
to call, say, {.send\_output()} instead? That’s where {#implements}
steps in. It lets you choose the name for the main method. Just put
this in your template definition:

```
#implements send_output

```

When one template extends another, every template in the
inheritance chain has its own main method. To fill the template,
you invoke exactly one of these methods and the others are ignored.
The method you call may be in any of the templates in the
inheritance chain: the base template, the leaf template, or any in
between, depending on how you structure your application. So you
have two problems: (1) calling the right method name, and (2)
preventing an undesired same-name subclass method from overriding
the one you want to call.

Cheetah assumes the method you will call is {.respond()} because
that’s what Webware calls. It further assumes the desired main
method is the one in the lowest-level base template, because that
works well with {#block} as described in the Inheritance Approach
for building Webware servlets (section webware.inheritance), which
was originally the principal use for Cheetah. So when you use
{#extends}, Cheetah changes that template’s main method to
{.writeBody()} to get it out of the way and prevent it from
overriding the base template’s {.respond()}.

Unfortunately this assumption breaks down if the template is used
in other ways. For instance, you may want to use the main method in
the highest-level leaf template, and treat the base template(s) as
merely a library of methods/attributes. In that case, the leaf
template needs {#implements respond} to change its main method name
back to {.respond()} (or whatever your application desires to
call). Likewise, if your main method is in one of the intermediate
templates in an inheritance chain, that template needs {#implements
respond}.

The other way the assumption breaks down is if the main method {
is} in the base template but that template extends a pure Python
class. Cheetah sees the {#extends} and dutifully but incorrectly
renames the method to {.writeBody()}, so you have to use
{#implements respond} to change it back. Otherwise the dummy
{.respond()} in {Cheetah.Template} is found, which outputs…
nothing. { So if you’re using {#extends} and get no output, the {
first} thing you should think is,
“Do I need to add {#implements respond} somewhere?” }

## #set[¶](#set "Permalink to this headline")

Syntax:

```
#set [global] $var = EXPR

```

{#set} is used to create and update local variables at run time.
The expression may be any Python expression. Remember to preface
variable names with $ unless they’re part of an intermediate result
in a list comprehension.

Here are some examples:

```
#set $size = $length * 1096
#set $buffer = $size + 1096
#set $area = $length * $width
#set $namesList = ['Moe','Larry','Curly']
#set $prettyCountry = $country.replace(' ', '&nbsp;')

```

{#set} variables are useful to assign a short name to a
{$deeply.nested.value}, to a calculation, or to a printable version
of a value. The last example above converts any spaces in the
‘country’ value into HTML non-breakable-space entities, to ensure
the entire value appears on one line in the browser.

{#set} variables are also useful in {#if} expressions, but remember
that complex logical routines should be coded in Python, not in
Cheetah!

```
#if $size > 1500
  #set $adj = 'large'
#else
  #set $adj = 'small'
#end if

```

Or Python’s one-line equivalent, “A and B or C”. Remember that in
this case, B must be a true value (not None, ‘’, 0, [] or {}).

```
#set $adj = $size > 1500 and 'large' or 'small'

```

(Note: Cheetah’s one-line {#if} will not work for this, since it
produces output rather than setting a variable.

You can also use the augmented assignment operators:

```
## Increment $a by 5.
#set $a += 5

```

By default, {#set} variables are not visible in method calls or
include files unless you use the {global} attribute: {#set global
$var = EXPRESSION}. Global variables are visible in all methods,
nested templates and included files. Use this feature with care to
prevent surprises.

## #del[¶](#del "Permalink to this headline")

Syntax:

```
#del $var

```

{#del} is the opposite of {#set}. It deletes a { local} variable.
Its usage is just like Python’s {del} statement:

```
#del $myVar
#del $myVar, $myArray[5]

```

Only local variables can be deleted. There is no directive to
delete a {#set global} variable, a searchList variable, or any
other type of variable.

## #attr[¶](#attr "Permalink to this headline")

Syntax:

```
#attr $var = EXPR

```

The {#attr} directive creates class attributes in the generated
Python class. It should be used to assign simple Python literals
such as numbers or strings. In particular, the expression must {
not} depend on searchList values or {#set} variables since those
are not known at compile time.

```
#attr $title = "Rob Roy"
#attr $author = "Sir Walter Scott"
#attr $version = 123.4

```

This template or any child template can output the value thus:

```
$title, by $author, version $version

```

If you have a library of templates derived from etexts
(<http://www.gutenberg.org/>), you can extract the titles and authors
and put them in a database (assuming the templates have been
compiled into .py template modules):

## #def[¶](#def "Permalink to this headline")

Syntax:

```
#def METHOD[(ARGUMENTS)]
#end def

```

Or the one-line variation:

```
#def METHOD[(ARGUMENTS)] : TEXT_AND_PLACEHOLDERS

```

The {#def} directive is used to define new methods in the generated
Python class, or to override superclass methods. It is analogous to
Python’s {def} statement. The directive is silent, meaning it does
not itself produce any output. However, the content of the method
will be inserted into the output (and the directives executed)
whenever the method is later called by a $placeholder.

```
#def myMeth()
This is the text in my method
$a $b $c(123)  ## these placeholder names have been defined elsewhere
#end def

## and now use it...
$myMeth()

```

The arglist and parentheses can be omitted:

```
#def myMeth
This is the text in my method
$a $b $c(123)
#end def

## and now use it...
$myMeth

```

Methods can have arguments and have defaults for those arguments,
just like in Python. Remember the {$} before variable names:

```
#def myMeth($a, $b=1234)
This is the text in my method
$a - $b
#end def

## and now use it...
$myMeth(1)

```

The output from this last example will be:

```
This is the text in my method
1 - 1234

```

There is also a single line version of the {#def} directive. {
Unlike the multi-line directives, it uses a colon (:) to delimit
the method signature and body}:

```
#attr $adj = 'trivial'
#def myMeth: This is the $adj method
$myMeth

```

Leading and trailing whitespace is stripped from the method. This
is in contrast to:

```
#def myMeth2
This is the $adj method
#end def

```

where the method includes a newline after “method”. If you don’t
want the newline, add {#slurp}:

```
#def myMeth3
This is the $adj method#slurp
#end def

```

Because {#def} is handled at compile time, it can appear above or
below the placeholders that call it. And if a superclass
placeholder calls a method that’s overridden in a subclass, it’s
the subclass method that will be called.

## #block … #end block[¶](#block-end-block "Permalink to this headline")

The {#block} directive allows you to mark a section of your
template that can be selectively reimplemented in a subclass. It is
very useful for changing part of a template without having to
copy-paste-and-edit the entire thing. The output from a template
definition that uses blocks will be identical to the output from
the same template with the {#block … #end block} tags removed.

({ Note:} don’t be confused by the generic word ‘block’’ in this
Guide, which means a section of code inside { any} {#TAG … #end
TAG} pair. Thus, an if-block, for-block, def-block, block-block
etc. In this section we are talking only of block-blocks.)

To reimplement the block, use the {#def} directive. The magical
effect is that it appears to go back and change the output text {
at the point the original block was defined} rather than at the
location of the reimplementation.

```
#block testBlock
Text in the contents
area of the block directive
#if $testIt
$getFoo()
#end if
#end block testBlock

```

You can repeat the block name in the {#end block} directive or not,
as you wish.

{#block} directives can be nested to any depth.

```
#block outerBlock
Outer block contents

#block innerBlock1
inner block1 contents
#end block innerBlock1

#block innerBlock2
inner block2 contents
#end block innerBlock2

#end block outerBlock

```

Note that the name of the block is optional for the {#end block}
tag.

Technically, {#block} directive is equivalent to a {#def} directive
followed immediately by a {#placeholder} for the same name. In
fact, that’s what Cheetah does. Which means you can use
{$theBlockName} elsewhere in the template to output the block
content again.

There is a one-line {#block} syntax analagous to the one-line
{#def}.

The block must not require arguments because the implicit
placeholder that’s generated will call the block without
arguments.

Cobbler is a Linux installation server that allows for rapid setup of network installation environments. It glues
together and automates many associated Linux tasks so you do not have to hop between lots of various commands and
applications when rolling out new systems, and, in some cases, changing existing ones. It can help with installation,
DNS, DHCP, package updates, power management, configuration management orchestration, and much more.

# CVSS v4 base metrics

##### Exploitability Metrics

Attack Vector:
This metric reflects the context by which vulnerability exploitation is possible. This metric value (and consequently the resulting severity) will be larger the more remote (logically, and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerable system. The assumption is that the number of potential attackers for a vulnerability that could be exploited from across a network is larger than the number of potential attackers that could exploit a vulnerability requiring physical access to a device, and therefore warrants a greater severity.

Attack Complexity:
This metric captures measurable actions that must be taken by the attacker to actively evade or circumvent existing built-in security-enhancing conditions in order to obtain a working exploit. These are conditions whose primary purpose is to increase security and/or increase exploit engineering complexity. A vulnerability exploitable without a target-specific variable has a lower complexity than a vulnerability that would require non-trivial customization. This metric is meant to capture security mechanisms utilized by the vulnerable system.

Attack Requirements:
This metric captures the prerequisite deployment and execution conditions or variables of the vulnerable system that enable the attack. These differ from security-enhancing techniques/technologies (ref Attack Complexity) as the primary purpose of these conditions is not to explicitly mitigate attacks, but rather, emerge naturally as a consequence of the deployment and execution of the vulnerable system.

Privileges Required:
This metric describes the level of privileges an attacker must possess prior to successfully exploiting the vulnerability. The method by which the attacker obtains privileged credentials prior to the attack (e.g., free trial accounts), is outside the scope of this metric. Generally, self-service provisioned accounts do not constitute a privilege requirement if the attacker can grant themselves privileges as part of the attack.

User interaction:
This metric captures the requirement for a human user, other than the attacker, to participate in the successful compromise of the vulnerable system. This metric determines whether the vulnerability can be exploited solely at the will of the attacker, or whether a separate user (or user-initiated process) must participate in some manner.
##### Vulnerable System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the VULNERABLE SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the VULNERABLE SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
##### Subsequent System Impact Metrics

Confidentiality:
This metric measures the impact to the confidentiality of the information managed by the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM due to a successfully exploited vulnerability. Confidentiality refers to limiting information access and disclosure to only authorized users, as well as preventing access by, or disclosure to, unauthorized ones.

Integrity:
This metric measures the impact to integrity of a successfully exploited vulnerability. Integrity refers to the trustworthiness and veracity of information. Integrity of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM is impacted when an attacker makes unauthorized modification of system data. Integrity is also impacted when a system user can repudiate critical actions taken in the context of the system (e.g. due to insufficient logging).

Availability:
This metric measures the impact to the availability of the SUBSEQUENT SYSTEM resulting from a successfully exploited vulnerability. While the Confidentiality and Integrity impact metrics apply to the loss of confidentiality or integrity of data (e.g., information, files) used by the system, this metric refers to the loss of availability of the impacted system itself, such as a networked service (e.g., web, database, email). Since availability refers to the accessibility of information resources, attacks that consume network bandwidth, processor cycles, or disk space all impact the availability of a system.
