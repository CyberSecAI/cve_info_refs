  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "Stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "The vulnerability is a stored XSS, meaning the malicious script is saved on the server side (device). When a user views the page containing this script, it executes in their browser."
    ],
    "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious client-side scripts into the device's web interface. When another user views the affected page, the attacker's scripts will execute in their browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, data theft, or other malicious activities.",
      "attack_vectors": [
        "An attacker injects the malicious script through a vulnerable input field or parameter in the web interface. This injected script is then stored and rendered to other users of the web interface.",
        "The specific injection point is not provided by this document, but would likely be an unvalidated input field within the device's administrative interface."
    ],
    "attacker_capabilities": "The attacker needs to be able to interact with the device's web interface to inject the malicious script and must have the required authentication privileges. The attacker does not need direct access to the userâ€™s device, only the vulnerable web interface of the target device."
