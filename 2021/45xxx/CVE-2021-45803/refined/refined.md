Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45803:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

*   The vulnerability stems from a lack of sanitization of the `view` parameter in the `my_reservation_details.php` file of the iResturant application. The application directly uses the value of the `view` parameter in a SQL query without proper escaping or using prepared statements.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

*   **SQL Injection:** The application is vulnerable to SQL injection due to the direct inclusion of the `view` parameter's value into a SQL query. This allows an attacker to inject malicious SQL code.

**Impact of exploitation:**

*   An attacker can potentially manipulate the database by injecting arbitrary SQL queries. This can lead to data exfiltration, data modification, or denial of service. The provided proof of concept demonstrates how an attacker can inject a `SLEEP` command to cause a delay, but more complex malicious SQL queries can be used.

**Attack vectors:**

*   The attack vector is through the HTTP GET parameter `view` in the `my_reservation_details.php` file. An attacker can manipulate the URL to inject malicious SQL code.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

*   The attacker needs to be able to make HTTP requests to the vulnerable endpoint.
*   The attacker needs to have the capability to craft malicious SQL code that can be injected via the `view` parameter.
*   The attacker needs to have access to the application's `my_reservation_details.php` page after authentication. The user must first log in via `my_login.php`

**Additional Details:**
* The content provides the vulnerable code snippet from the iResturant application, which directly uses the `$view` GET parameter value in a SQL query.
* A proof of concept is provided showing how an attacker can inject a SQL statement to cause a delay, using the sleep function.
* The content also includes a link to a video demonstrating the exploit.
