Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45975:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is a DLL hijacking vulnerability in `ListCheck.exe`, a component of the Acer Care Center software suite.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **Phantom DLL Hijacking:** The `ListCheck.exe` executable attempts to load `profapi.dll` from the `C:\ProgramData\OEM\UpgradeTool\` directory.
- **Insecure directory permissions:** The `C:\ProgramData\OEM\UpgradeTool\` directory has weak ACL (Access Control List) configurations, allowing unprivileged users to write to the directory.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Privilege Escalation:** A low-privileged user can place a malicious `profapi.dll` in the vulnerable directory. When an administrator logs in, `ListCheck.exe` runs with elevated privileges and loads the malicious DLL, resulting in arbitrary code execution with high integrity.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Local Attack:** The attack is performed locally on the system.
- **File system manipulation:** An attacker needs write access to the vulnerable directory in order to place the malicious DLL

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to have a low privileged account on the target system.
- The attacker needs to be able to write to the `C:\ProgramData\OEM\UpgradeTool\` directory.
- The attacker does not need any other special privileges, and they do not need to interact with any other process or program.

**Additional Details**
- The vulnerable versions of Acer Care Center are V4.00.3000 through V4.00.3034.
- The fix is to update to Acer Care Center software to V4.00.3038 or newer.
- The vulnerability was reported to Acer on 2021/10/30 and patched on 2021/12/27.
-  A workaround is to disable the "Software Update Application" scheduled task.
