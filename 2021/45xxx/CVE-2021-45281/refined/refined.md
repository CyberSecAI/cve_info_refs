**Vulnerability:** Reflected XSS

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The content mentions "Reflected XSS" as a vulnerability found in QuickBox, and it's specifically tied to CVE-2021-45281. However, no specific technical details or vulnerable code snippets are provided.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
*   Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
*   Allows an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web application, potentially leading to:
    *   Stealing user session cookies

*   The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL.
*   The attacker must be able to trick the victim into accessing the URL.
