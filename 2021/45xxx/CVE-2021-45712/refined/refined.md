- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `get` method generated by `rust-embed` in debug mode, when the `debug-embed` feature is disabled, doesn't validate that the input path is within the designated folder.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Directory traversal vulnerability. The application allows access to files outside the intended directory due to insufficient input validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can read arbitrary files on the file system by providing a crafted file path with directory traversal sequences (e.g., `../`).
- **Attack vectors:** The attacker needs control over the filename given as input to the `get` method.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to influence the input given to the `get` method. This suggests they would need to be able to pass user defined input into the application.
