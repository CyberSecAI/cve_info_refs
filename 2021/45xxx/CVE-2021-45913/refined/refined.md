The provided content relates to CVE-2021-45913.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The authentication process between ControlUp Real-Time Console/Monitor and ControlUp Real-Time Agents relied on hardcoded keys.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Hardcoded cryptographic keys within the ControlUp Real-Time Console/Monitor binary.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker could extract the hardcoded key from the ControlUp Real-Time Console/Monitor binary. Then, using this key, they could craft a malicious ControlUp Real-Time Console/Monitor, successfully authenticating to ControlUp Real-Time Agents, and execute arbitrary OS commands with SYSTEM level privileges on the agent machine.

**Attack vectors:**
Extraction of the hardcoded key from the ControlUp Real-Time Console/Monitor binary file, followed by network-based attacks against machines running ControlUp Real-Time Agents.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs access to the ControlUp Real-Time Console/Monitor binary to extract the hardcoded key. They also need network access to systems running vulnerable ControlUp Real-Time Agents.
