Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45445:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**

- A malformed TCP packet with specific TCP options can trigger an infinite loop in the networking stack.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**

- Improper handling of malformed TCP options.
- Lack of proper input validation/error handling in the TCP processing logic.
- Infinite loop condition in the network processing stack when encountering a malformed TCP packet.

**Impact of exploitation:**

-  Denial of Service (DoS) condition.
-  100% CPU utilization of the CPM (Central Processing Module), specifically the networking input stack.
-  Stalling of network processing threads (TCPIP/ACADIA/NP/N or TCPIP/~/DYNSRV/N).
-  The affected system becomes unresponsive and unable to process network traffic.

**Attack vectors:**

- Network-based attack.
- Attackers can send crafted, malformed TCP packets to the target system.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**

- Network access to the affected system.
- Ability to send custom TCP packets with malformed options.
- No authentication or special privileges are required to trigger the vulnerability as stated by the CVSS vector **AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H**

**Additional Details:**

- The affected products are MCP TCP/IP versions 59.1, 60.0, and 62.0.
- The vulnerability is identified by Unisys as **UIS-2021-7**.
- The vulnerability is categorized under CWE-835 (Loop with Unreachable Exit Condition ('Infinite Loop')).
- Patches are available in TCP-IP-SW-059.1A.55, TCP-IP-SW-060.0a.26, and TCP-IP-SW-062.0a.3.
- No workarounds are available.
