This is a denial-of-service (DoS) attack.\n\nAttack vectors:\nAttackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup.\n\nRequired attacker capabilities/position:\nAn attacker needs to be able to control Thread Context Map (MDC) input data. The attack can be done remotely."

          "content": "The vulnerability is triggered when logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, `$${ctx:loginId}`). Attackers can cause an infinite recursion using self-referential lookups, which will lead to a denial-of-service via a stack overflow.  Specifically, the message parameters themselves are not evaluated for parameters; they are only included in the format string corresponding to their template position. The conversion of message parameters into a string is done on-demand depending on the layout being used."
