- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `zeroize_derive` crate, when used with the `#[zeroize(drop)]` attribute on an `enum`, failed to implement the `Drop` trait.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: The crate did not properly zero out the memory occupied by an `enum` when it was dropped, despite the intention of the `#[zeroize(drop)]` attribute, leading to potential exposure of sensitive data.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Sensitive data stored within the `enum` could persist in memory after it's no longer in use, potentially accessible to attackers who can read memory.
- **Attack vectors**: An attacker with the ability to read memory could potentially obtain sensitive information if an application is using `#[zeroize(drop)]` on enums and is running vulnerable versions of the crate.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker would need to have the capability to read process memory.
