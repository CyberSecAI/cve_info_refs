This document describes a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router, extender, and WiFi system models. The advisory does not specify a CVE ID, but it is associated with the NETGEAR PSV ID PSV-2020-0256.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting issue. This means that malicious scripts can be stored on the affected device and executed when a user interacts with the affected functionality.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to execute malicious scripts in the context of a user's browser when they access the management interface of the affected NETGEAR device. This could lead to:
*   Account compromise
*   Data theft
*   Malware distribution
*   Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:** An attacker would need to inject malicious script into a field or setting that is later displayed to other users of the device through a web interface.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to access and manipulate device settings to inject the malicious script. This likely requires administrative access.
*  The attacker needs a vector on the UI to inject the malicious code in a persistent manner.
* A victim would need to access the affected page, causing the malicious script to execute.

The advisory provides a list of affected models and firmware versions that are vulnerable.
The advisory suggests upgrading the firmware to the latest version to remediate the vulnerability.
