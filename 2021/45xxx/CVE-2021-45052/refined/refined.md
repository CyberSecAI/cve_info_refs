Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-45052:

*   **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Read (CWE-125)
*   **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software attempts to read data beyond the boundaries of the allocated buffer.
*   **Impact of exploitation:**
    *   Privilege escalation (Moderate Severity) - While it's not as severe as arbitrary code execution, the attacker may gain elevated privileges due to the memory leak, which would be the main symptom.
*   **Attack vectors:**
    *   Local Access (AV:L)
    *   Low Attack Complexity (AC:L)
    *   No privileges required (PR:N)
    *   User Interaction Required (UI:R) - The user needs to perform some action to trigger the vulnerability, like opening a malicious file.
    *   Scope Unchanged (S:U) - The vulnerability does not extend beyond the vulnerable component itself.
*   **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker would need to entice a user to open a crafted file or perform a specific action that triggers the out-of-bounds read. The attacker must be able to provide a specially crafted file or trigger through local user interaction.
