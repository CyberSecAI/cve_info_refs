The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a reflected cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability, and it lists affected products. Although the advisory does not explicitly mention CVE-2021-45639, it does detail a vulnerability that is classified as a Reflected Cross Site Scripting issue with a CVSS score of 5.2, making it relevant.

Here's a breakdown of the information:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is a reflected cross-site scripting vulnerability in the web interface of various Netgear router, extender, and WiFi systems.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
The vulnerability is a reflected XSS issue, meaning malicious script is injected into the response from the server that the client renders in their browser.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation can allow an attacker to execute arbitrary JavaScript code in the context of a user's browser when they access the compromised page on the router's interface. This can lead to:
* Account hijacking
* Stealing session cookies
* Performing actions on behalf of the victim
* Redirecting users to malicious websites
* Other malicious activities

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is through a specially crafted URL or HTTP request to the web interface of the affected Netgear device. The malicious script is injected into the request and then reflected back to the user in the response.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
An attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL and convince a user to click on it or visit the affected page, such as through social engineering. The attacker also must be able to deliver the crafted URL to a user of the device. This can be via phishing, or through a compromised website that the user might visit.

**Affected Products:**
The advisory lists a large number of Netgear products affected, including routers (R series, RAX series), extenders (EX series, EAX series), and WiFi systems (Orbi, MR series, MS series) along with their affected firmware versions.
