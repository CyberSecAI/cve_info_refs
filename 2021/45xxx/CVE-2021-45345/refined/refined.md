Based on the provided information, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45345:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The root cause is improper memory handling when processing HTTP requests in WebCam Server v0.5.2 and earlier. The server fails to properly clean up memory when receiving large HTTP requests.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The vulnerability is a buffer overflow. The application's lack of proper input validation and memory management leads to an exploitable condition.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Exploitation results in a denial-of-service (DoS) condition. The unhandled Structured Exception Handler triggered by excessive memory usage causes the application to crash.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is remote. It involves sending multiple large HTTP requests to the vulnerable server.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send network requests to the server. They do not need any special access or credentials on the target system.
- The attacker can trigger the vulnerability remotely through the network.

**Additional details:**
- The provided `poc.py` script demonstrates how to trigger the vulnerability by sending a continuous stream of POST requests with large payloads.
- The vulnerability was discovered by Nathan Rice.
- The vendor of the product is en3rgy, and the affected product is Webcam Server 0.5.2 and below.
