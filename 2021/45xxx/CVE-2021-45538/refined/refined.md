The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear regarding a post-authentication command injection vulnerability. Here's a breakdown:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection, meaning an attacker needs to be authenticated to exploit it. The exact vulnerable code is not specified, but it implies that user-supplied input is improperly sanitized and then used in a system command, which can be manipulated by the attacker.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: Improper sanitization of user input allows an authenticated attacker to inject arbitrary commands to be executed on the device's operating system.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- The CVSS vector indicates a high impact across all three security properties:
    - Confidentiality: High (C:H) - An attacker could gain access to sensitive information on the device.
    - Integrity: High (I:H) - An attacker could modify system settings or data.
    - Availability: High (A:H) - An attacker could disrupt the deviceâ€™s functionality, potentially leading to a denial of service.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-based attack (AV:A): The attack vector is adjacent, meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network as the target device. This implies it can be exploited from the LAN side, or via WiFi if the attacker is connected to the device's WiFi.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
-  The attacker must have high privileges (PR:H). This means the attacker needs to be authenticated with administrative access to the device's management interface.
- The attacker does not require any user interaction to perform the exploit (UI:N).
- The attack exploits a vulnerability in the firmware of the affected routers.

**Affected Products:**
- The advisory lists several Netgear router models affected:
    - RAX75
    - RAX80
    - RBK752
    - RBR750
    - RBS750
    - RBK852
    - RBR850
    - RBS850

**Mitigation:**
- Update to the specified firmware version or later is the recommended fix.

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory mentions a CVSS score of 8.4, which is categorized as high severity.
- The advisory was published on 2021-09-26.
- The advisory acknowledges "wtbw" for reporting the vulnerability.
- The advisory provides instructions for how to update firmware via the web interface or via the apps
