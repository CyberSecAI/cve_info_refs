- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Hardcoded password in the firmware.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Use of a hardcoded password.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation would lead to unauthorized access and control over the affected device, which could include manipulation of settings and data, eavesdropping, and potentially using the device as a jump point for further network attacks. The CVSS score indicates low confidentiality and integrity impact but a high scope change.
- **Attack vectors:** The specific attack vector isn't stated in this document, but it would likely involve attempting to use the hardcoded password to gain access through the device's administrative interface or related services. The CVSS vector indicates an adjacent network attack vector.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be on the same local network or adjacent network as the vulnerable device to exploit the weakness. No special privileges or user interaction is required (PR:N, UI:N).
