- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Out-of-bounds Write (CWE-787)
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The software is vulnerable to an out-of-bounds write, which occurs when a program attempts to write data beyond the allocated memory buffer.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation can lead to arbitrary code execution.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is local (AV:L).
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** No privileges are required (PR:N), but user interaction is required (UI:R). The attack does not require a specific scope change (S:U).
