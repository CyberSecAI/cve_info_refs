WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Siemens has not identiﬁed any additional speciﬁc workarounds or mitigations. Please follow the General
Security Recommendations.

Product speciﬁc mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

As a general security measure, Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access to devices
with appropriate mechanisms. In order to operate the devices in a protected IT environment, Siemens
recommends to conﬁgure the environment according to Siemens’ operational guidelines for Industrial
Security (Download: https://www.siemens.com/cert/operational-guidelines-industrial-security), and to
follow the recommendations in the product manuals.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

The SICAM A8000 RTUs (Remote Terminal Units) series is a modular device range for telecontrol and
automation applications in all areas of energy supply.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45033

An undocumented debug port uses hard-coded default credentials.
If this port is enabled by a
privileged user, an attacker aware of the credentials could access an administrative debug shell on the
affected device.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45034

The web server of the affected system allows access to logﬁles and diagnostic data generated by a
privileged user. An unauthenticated attacker could access the ﬁles by knowing the corresponding
download links.
