- **Root cause of vulnerability**: An undocumented debug port uses hard-coded default credentials.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798).
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker aware of the default credentials could access an administrative debug shell on the affected device.
- **Attack vectors**: Network access to the device. The vulnerable debug port needs to be enabled by a privileged user first.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be aware of the default credentials. The attacker also needs to have network access to the device. A privileged user must have enabled the debug port.
