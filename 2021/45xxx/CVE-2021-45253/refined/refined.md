The provided content is related to CVE-2021-45253.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is an SQL injection vulnerability in the `view_storage.php` page of the Simple Cold Storage Management System 1.0. The `id` parameter in the URL is not properly sanitized, allowing an attacker to inject arbitrary SQL code.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection: The application is vulnerable to SQL injection via the `id` parameter in the `view_storage.php` script.
- Insecure direct object reference: The application directly uses the id parameter to retrieve the storage information.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Arbitrary code execution on the database server via the `load_file` function.
- Extraction of sensitive data.
- Bypass authentication via SQL injection, leading to full system control.
- Complete compromise of the application and its data.

**Attack vectors:**
- HTTP GET request with a crafted `id` parameter in `view_storage.php`.
- The malicious payload is injected through the vulnerable `id` parameter.
- Remote exploitation.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable application.
- No authentication is required to exploit this vulnerability.
- Basic understanding of SQL syntax.

**Additional details:**
- The content includes specific payloads used for the SQL injection, which leverages `load_file()` function to interact with an external server.
- Also includes a UNION query based SQL injection payload to potentially extract information from the database.
- The content references an external blog post (nu11secur1ty.com) with details of the exploit and a PoC.
