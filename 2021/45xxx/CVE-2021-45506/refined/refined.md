This document is related to an authentication bypass vulnerability, not a placeholder.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Authentication bypass vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the authentication mechanism.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could lead to unauthorized access to the device, potentially allowing for complete control of the affected devices. The CVSS score is 9.6, with High impact on confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network as the affected device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must be on the same local network as the vulnerable device, no special privileges are required(PR:N), and there is no user interaction required (UI:N).
