The provided document is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability, referred to as PSV-2020-0298, which affects multiple router models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The advisory indicates a "pre-authentication command injection security vulnerability", meaning that an attacker can inject malicious commands before authentication is completed. Specific details about the vulnerable code are not provided.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- The primary weakness is a command injection vulnerability that exists in the pre-authentication phase of the affected devices.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- The advisory does not explicitly detail the impact, however, given the CVSS score and vector, successful exploitation can allow an attacker to gain full control of the affected devices. This includes potential compromise of confidentiality, integrity and availability (C:H/I:H/A:H).

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploitable via a network attack (AV:A).
- Exploitation does not require user interaction (UI:N) or special privileges (PR:N).
- The scope is changed because it's exploitable to the whole device/system (S:C).
- The advisory mentions it is a "pre-authentication" vulnerability, therefore, the attack can be performed before authentication is complete.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must have adjacent network access (AV:A) to the affected device.
- No special privileges are needed to exploit the vulnerability (PR:N).

**Affected Products:**
The advisory lists the following models:
   - D7000v2 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.66)
   - D8500 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.58)
   - R7000 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.11.110)
   - R7100LG (firmware versions prior to 1.0.0.72)
   - R7900 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.30)
   - R8000 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.4.62)
   - XR300 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.3.56)
   - R7000P (firmware versions prior to 1.3.2.132)
   - R8500 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.144)
   - R6900P (firmware versions prior to 1.3.2.132)
   - R8300 (firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.144)

**Mitigation:**
- NETGEAR strongly advises users to update their firmware to the latest versions to patch the vulnerability.

**CVSS:**
- CVSS Rating: Critical
- CVSS Score: 9.6
- CVSS Vector: CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:N/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H

**Additional Notes:**
- The advisory states that the vulnerability is not associated with any CVE IDs, which suggests this vulnerability was discovered and fixed prior to CVE assignment.
- The advisory does not provide details of the vulnerable component.
- The advisory acknowledges 'peanuts' for reporting the vulnerability.

This information provides a solid overview of the vulnerability detailed in the NETGEAR security advisory, even though it's not assigned a CVE.
