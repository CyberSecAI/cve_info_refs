The provided content is related to CVE-2021-45912.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** A named pipe interface within the ControlUp Real-Time Agent process allowed execution of OS commands without authentication.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Lack of authentication for a named pipe interface, which allows arbitrary OS command execution.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Local Privilege Escalation, meaning an attacker with local access to a machine running a vulnerable ControlUp Real-Time Agent can execute arbitrary commands with elevated privileges.

**Attack vectors:**
- Local access is required, so an attacker must have some level of access to the machine running the vulnerable agent.
- Exploitation occurs via the unauthenticated named pipe interface

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- Local access to a machine running a vulnerable version of ControlUp Real-Time Agent is required.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability exists in ControlUp Real-Time Agents prior to version 8.5.
- The advisory strongly recommends upgrading to version 8.5.1 for Hybrid Cloud and 8.5 for On-Premises.
- The advisory also emphasizes that all ControlUp Real-Time Agents need to be updated or uninstalled, even if they are no longer actively in use because they can still pose a risk.
- The vulnerability was discovered by James Burton and Michael N. Henry from the Facebook Red Team.
