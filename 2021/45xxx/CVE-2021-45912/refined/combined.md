# Security Advisory – Local Privilege Escalation

## CVE-2021-45912: Security Advisory

This document addresses Local Privilege Escalation vulnerability (CVE-2021-45912) in Controlup Real-Time.

       **Vulnerability ID:** CVE-2021-45912
 **Severity:** High
 **Update Release Date:** June 29, 2021
 **Fix version:** Version >= 8.5.0 for both Hybrid Cloud and COP (On-Premises)
#### What was the problem?

A Named Pipe interface within ControlUp Real-Time Agent’s process provided the ability to run actions (OS commands) without authentication. This vulnerability can be exploited locally only.

#### Solution

We strongly urge you to do the following as soon as possible:

* Upgrade to the latest version of ControlUp (8.5.1 for Hybrid Cloud/8.5 for On-Premises).
* Deploy the latest ControlUp Real-Time Agent to all endpoints.

It is important to update/uninstall all ControlUp Real-Time Agents even if they are no longer in use. ControlUp Real-Time Agents of versions lower than 8.5 can put your organization at risk even if there is no ControlUp Console/Monitor connected to them. You can watch this [2-minute video](https://youtu.be/3Z-iWOmt07k) to learn how to easily find machines with older ControlUp Real-Time Agent versions.
