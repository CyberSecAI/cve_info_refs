    "related": true,
    "summary": "The provided content discusses CVE-2021-45474, a cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in MediaWiki's Special:ImportFile page.",
    "details": {
      "root_cause": "The vulnerability stems from the `clientUrl` parameter of the Special:ImportFile page not being properly sanitized. This allows an attacker to inject arbitrary HTML code into the URL, which is then rendered by the page, leading to XSS.",
      "weaknesses": [
        "Improper input sanitization",
         "Cross-site scripting (XSS)"
      ],
      "impact": "An attacker can inject malicious HTML/JavaScript code. This code is then executed when a user visits the crafted URL, potentially leading to session hijacking, stealing sensitive information, or other malicious actions. An alert box is specifically demonstrated in the report, which could be replaced with any other malicious payload.",
       "attack_vectors": [
        "Crafted URL to the Special:ImportFile page with malicious code in the clientUrl parameter."
       ],
      "attacker_capabilities": "An attacker needs the ability to craft a URL and trick a user into visiting it. User does not have to be logged-in.",
       "attacker_positioning": "An attacker can be an external unauthenticated user. It was found by a member of Wikimedia communities.",
        "additional_notes": "The vulnerability was patched by escaping user input before displaying the content. The fix was backported to multiple versions of MediaWiki. The patch was deployed to wmf.9. All changes are publicly available on gerrit."
