**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue in Netgear R7000 routers.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation of this vulnerability could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the web interface of the router. This can lead to a variety of impacts such as:
- Session hijacking
- Defacement of web pages
- Stealing of user credentials
- Redirecting users to malicious websites
- Other client-side attacks.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is triggered by injecting a malicious script which is then stored on the router. When other users access the affected page, the malicious script will be executed in their browsers.
- The advisory mentions that the vulnerability is present in firmware versions prior to 1.0.11.126 of the Netgear R7000 router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker needs to find a way to inject the malicious script, which likely involves some authenticated access to the router web interface.
- A high privilege level is required to inject the script via the web interface.
- A user needs to interact with the affected page where the malicious script is stored to trigger the XSS.
