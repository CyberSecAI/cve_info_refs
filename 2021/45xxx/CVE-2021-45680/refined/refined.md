- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `vec-const` crate attempted to construct a `Vec` with a non-zero length and capacity within a `const` context. This is not possible because `Vec` requires memory allocation, which cannot be done in a `const` context.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The crate had an unsound implementation that could lead to memory corruption.
- **Impact of exploitation:** The vulnerability can cause memory corruption due to the construction of a `Vec` with a dangling pointer.
- **Attack vectors:** This vulnerability is triggered by attempting to use the unsound `vec-const` crate to construct a `Vec` in a constant context.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to use the affected versions of the crate.
