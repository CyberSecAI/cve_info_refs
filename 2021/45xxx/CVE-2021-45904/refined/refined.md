The content is related to CVE-2021-45904.

- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability is a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) issue. It stems from insufficient sanitization of user input in multiple fields of the OpenWrt LuCI web interface.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Stored XSS vulnerability. User-supplied input in the "Name" fields is not sanitized, allowing malicious JavaScript to be stored.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker could inject malicious JavaScript code into the system via the web interface. This code would be executed when other users view the affected pages, potentially leading to:
    - Session hijacking.
    - Privilege escalation within the web interface.
    - Defacement of the interface.
    - Other malicious actions depending on the JavaScript payload.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is through the OpenWrt LuCI web interface. Specifically, it is exploited by inserting malicious JavaScript code into the "Name" fields within the following sections:
    - Network -> Firewall -> Port Forwards -> Add
    - Network -> Firewall -> Traffic Rules
    - Network -> Firewall -> NAT Rules
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to have access to the OpenWrt LuCI web interface, with the ability to configure firewall rules.
