Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability described in CVE-2021-45379:

**1. Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
- Incorrect access control in Glewlwyd, a web service. The vulnerability stems from a flaw in the authentication process where one user can attempt to log in as another user without knowing the other user's password.

**2. Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Incorrect Access Control:** The system fails to properly verify user identity during authentication. This results in the ability for one user to potentially impersonate another.
- **Authentication Bypass:** The vulnerability allows bypassing the standard password-based authentication mechanism.

**3. Impact of Exploitation:**
- **User Impersonation:** An attacker can gain access to another user's account without knowing their password.
- **Unauthorized Access:** Successful exploitation leads to unauthorized access to the targeted user's data and resources within the Glewlwyd system.
- **Privilege Escalation (Implicit):** While not explicitly stated, the user is able to escalate privileges by being able to log in as another user.

**4. Attack Vectors:**
- **Network-Based:** The attack vector is through the network, as the authentication process involves network communications.
- **Login Process:** The vulnerability is exploited during the login process, specifically how user authentication is handled.

**5. Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Low Privilege:** The attacker requires low privileges within the system to attempt to log in. They do not need prior elevated access.
- **Network Access:** The attacker needs the ability to send authentication requests to the Glewlwyd service.
- **Valid Username:** The attacker must know a valid username on the Glewlwyd service to attempt to impersonate that user.

**Additional Notes:**
- The vulnerability was present in Glewlwyd version 2.0.0 and was fixed in version 2.6.1.
- The CVSS score for this vulnerability is 8.8, classifying it as high severity.
- The identified CWE is CWE-863 (Incorrect Authorization).
