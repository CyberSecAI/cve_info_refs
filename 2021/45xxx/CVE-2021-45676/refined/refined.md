The provided document describes a stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability, identified by NETGEAR as PSV-2020-0161, affecting several router models. While the advisory does not list a CVE ID, it details the vulnerability, its impact, and the affected products.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a stored XSS issue. This means that malicious scripts can be injected into the router's settings or configuration through a vulnerability and will be stored persistently, executing whenever other users interact with the affected part of the interface.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker could inject malicious scripts into the router's administrative interface
- When an administrator accesses the vulnerable part of the interface, the injected script would execute
- This could lead to actions performed by the malicious script, such as:
    - Account hijacking
    - Data exfiltration
    - Further malicious actions.

**Attack vectors:**
- The attack vector is the administrative interface of the router.
- An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious scripts into fields or areas that are not properly sanitized.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker would need administrative access to the router, or be able to manipulate the system in a way that would inject the malicious code in a persistent manner without authentication to the admin panel.
- The attacker would need knowledge of where the injection point is and how to properly craft malicious payloads

**Affected Models and Firmware Versions:**
*   RAX200, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.5.126
*   RAX20, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.82
*   RAX80, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.5.126
*   RAX15, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.2.82
*   RAX75, running firmware versions prior to 1.0.5.126

**Additional Information:**

*   The advisory indicates a CVSS score of 4.3, with a vector of CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:R/S:C/C:L/I:L/A:N, meaning this has a low impact, requires high privilege, and user interaction.
*   NETGEAR strongly recommends updating to the latest firmware to remediate the vulnerability.
*   The advisory was first published on 2021-12-20.
