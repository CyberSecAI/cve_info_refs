This document provides information about an authentication bypass vulnerability affecting NETGEAR R6700v2 routers.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The document describes an authentication bypass vulnerability but does not detail the technical root cause.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Authentication bypass vulnerability in NETGEAR R6700v2 routers.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- Successful exploitation would allow unauthorized access to the router's administrative interface and potentially other resources. The CVSS score implies a high impact to confidentiality, while integrity and availability are not directly affected.

**Attack vectors:**
- The CVSS vector suggests the attack vector is "Adjacent" (AV:A), meaning an attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the router.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- An attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable router.
- No specific user interaction is required (UI:N).
- No privileges are needed (PR:N).
