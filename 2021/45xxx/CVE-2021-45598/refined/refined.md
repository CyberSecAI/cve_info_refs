- **Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability that allows an attacker with high privileges to execute arbitrary commands on the affected devices.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Complete compromise of the affected device including confidentiality, integrity, and availability.
- **Attack vectors:** The vulnerability is triggered through a post-authentication command injection, which requires the attacker to be authenticated to the device.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to have high privileges to be able to exploit the vulnerability. The vulnerability is post-authentication.
