The provided content is a security advisory from NETGEAR regarding a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, which is **not related to CVE-2021-45592** as the advisory specifies "Associated CVE IDs: None". However, the advisory provides detailed information about the vulnerability.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** Post-authentication command injection vulnerability.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Command injection vulnerability that can be exploited after successful authentication to the device.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected system. This is indicated by the high confidentiality, integrity, and availability impact scores within the CVSS vector.

**Attack vectors:** The attack vector is adjacent (AV:A) meaning that the attacker needs to be on the same local network as the targeted device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker must have already authenticated to the device (PR:H), meaning high privileges are required for initial access. User interaction is not required (UI:N) and scope is changed (S:C) to indicate that this vulnerability has impact beyond the vulnerable component.

**Affected products:**
* RBK752
* RBR750
* RBS750
