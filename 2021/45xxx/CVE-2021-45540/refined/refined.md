The provided content is a security advisory from Netgear, which describes a post-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting several of their router and WiFi system models. This content is related to a CVE but since the CVE description is unavailable, it cannot be fully verified. However, the advisory references PSV-2020-0196, which may be helpful in future analysis.

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability is a post-authentication command injection flaw. Specific details on the injection point are not disclosed in the advisory.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- Command Injection: An attacker can inject arbitrary commands into the system via a vulnerable parameter/function after successful authentication.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- Full Control: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This could lead to complete compromise, potentially giving the attacker full control of the router and network. This includes unauthorized access, data theft, and the ability to use the router for further malicious activity.

**Attack Vectors:**
- Network-Based: This is likely a network-based attack, since it involves interacting with the web interface of the router.
- Post-Authentication: The attacker needs to successfully authenticate to the router’s web interface before being able to exploit the vulnerability.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- Authentication: The attacker needs valid user credentials to access the router’s web interface.
- Network Access: The attacker must have network connectivity to the vulnerable router, which could be through the local network or remote access, depending on router configuration.
