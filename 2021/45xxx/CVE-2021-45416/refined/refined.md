Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45416:

**Root Cause:**

- The vulnerability stems from a lack of proper sanitization of user-supplied input within the `search_term` parameter.
- Specifically, the `modules/Scheduling/Courses.php` script fails to neutralize or encode HTML special characters within this parameter before rendering the output back to the user.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**

-   **Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS):** The primary vulnerability is a reflected XSS, where the attacker injects malicious scripts via the `search_term` parameter, which are then reflected back to the user's browser and executed in the context of the web application.

**Impact of Exploitation:**

-   An attacker can inject arbitrary HTML and JavaScript code into the web page.
-   This can lead to various malicious activities:
    -   Session hijacking by stealing cookies
    -   Defacement of the web page
    -   Redirecting the user to malicious websites
    -   Phishing attacks, capturing user credentials or other sensitive information.
    -   Potentially gaining control of the user's account.

**Attack Vectors:**

-   The attack vector is through the `search_term` parameter of the following URL: `http://localhost/rosariosis/Modules.php?modname=misc/ChooseCourse.php&modfunc=choose_course&course_modfunc=search&last_year=&search_term=[malicious_script]`
-   The vulnerable script is accessible via  `ChooseCourse.php` and `ChooseRequest.php`

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**

-   The attacker needs to craft a URL containing the malicious script within the search\_term parameter.
-   The attacker needs to trick the victim into opening the crafted URL. This could be through social engineering or by embedding it on a website or email.
-   The victim must be using a vulnerable version of RosarioSIS (v8.2.1, or possibly earlier).
-   The github information notes that the vulnerable website needs to be opened in a popup.

**Additional Information:**

- The vulnerability was fixed in RosarioSIS version 8.3.
- A proof-of-concept (PoC) is available on the provided GitHub repository to demonstrate the attack and the vulnerability is demonstrated on the linked youtube video.

**Summary**
The provided content indicates a reflected XSS vulnerability in RosarioSIS v8.2.1, due to the lack of proper input sanitization of the `search_term` parameter in `modules/Scheduling/Courses.php`. This allows attackers to inject malicious scripts. The vulnerability was fixed in version 8.3.
