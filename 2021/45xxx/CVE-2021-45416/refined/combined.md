# CVE-2021-45416

Reflected Cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerability in RosarioSIS 8.2.1 allows attackers to inject arbitrary HTML via the search\_term parameter in the modules/Scheduling/Courses.php script.

* Vendor: francoisjacquet
* Vendor Website: <https://www.rosariosis.org/>
* Affected Product: RosarioSIS
* Affected Versions: v8.2.1, however it is *assumed* earlier versions might be affected as well

---

### Instructions to reproduce:

* Use RosarioSIS 8.2.1.
* Open the URL vulnerable to XSS: <http://localhost/rosariosis/Modules.php?modname=misc/ChooseCourse.php&modfunc=choose_course&course_modfunc=search&last_year=&search_term=%22%20onfocus%3D%22alert%28%60XSS%60%29> (make sure to replace localhost/rosariosis with your web server's path)
* **Note that this website needs to be opened in a popup, for example using the javascript window.open() method. A proof of concept code is available in this repo.**

### Cause

User-supplied input in the search\_term parameter is improperly neutralized in the modules/Scheduling/Courses.php script, which is accessible through ChooseCourse.php and ChooseRequest.php as shown in the proof of concept that you can find in this repo.

### Solution

Update to the latest version of RosarioSIS. This issue was fixed in version v8.3.

### References

* YouTube video showing the proof of concept: <https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PvFUxSGpWpY>
