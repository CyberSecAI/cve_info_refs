Based on the provided content, here's an analysis of CVE-2021-45099:

**Root Cause of Vulnerability:**
The vulnerability stems from the `addon.stdin` service in the hassio-addons/addon-ssh addon (versions <= 9.1.1). This service allowed users to execute arbitrary commands within the add-on's environment by sending input to the stdin of the addon's process.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Arbitrary Command Execution:** The `addon.stdin` service allows for the execution of arbitrary commands, which is a major security risk.
- **Social Engineering Attack Vector:**  While the vulnerability was not considered a traditional vulnerability by the addon maintainer, it was acknowledged that social engineering could potentially be used to trick users into using the service to execute malicious commands.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Information Disclosure**: As seen in the provided PoC, the vulnerability allows for the exfiltration of sensitive information such as the `secrets.yaml` file.
- **System Compromise**: Arbitrary command execution can lead to full system compromise.
- **Loss of Control:** Attackers could gain control of the addon, modify configurations or perform other actions that could be detrimental to the system.

**Attack Vectors:**
- The primary attack vector is through the `hassio.addon_stdin` service within the Home Assistant ecosystem.
-  Attackers could provide a malicious automation blueprint, as seen in the PoC, or otherwise trick users into using the service to execute harmful commands.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Access to a Home Assistant instance:** The attacker would need to have some access to the Home Assistant instance where the vulnerable add-on is installed.
- **Ability to influence user actions:** An attacker would need to leverage social engineering or other methods to convince users to execute the malicious commands via the service. This could be done, for example, by convincing them to import a malicious blueprint.

**Additional Notes**
- The vulnerability was patched in version 10.0.0 of the hassio-addons/addon-ssh addon, by removing the  `addon.stdin` service.
- The maintainer of the add-on did not consider this a typical vulnerability but removed the service to prevent potential harm via social engineering.
- The provided PoC demonstrates the exfiltration of the `secrets.yaml` file using the vulnerability, highlighting the potential for serious data breaches.
