* Php session\_gc is now force enabled by default.

  + This option can be disabled by setting enable within the session\_gc array to false in config.php
  + The values for session.gc\_probability and session.gc\_divisor can be changed in the following config.php entries within the session\_gc array

    - gc\_probability
    - gc\_divisor
  + Check php documentation for more information on these settings <https://www.php.net/manual/en/session.configuration.php>
  + If you are using a session\_dir other than the default, please make sure to have session\_gc enabled. Otherwise session files won’t be cleaned.
  + If you are using debian or ubuntu based systems, and you have the default session\_dir (which fallsback to the system default),
    You may want to set enable within session\_gc array to false, as that is the default value for these systems.
    They have replacements for the php session\_gc. Please review your system’s defaults before making any changes.

## 7.12.3

*Released 27/01/2022*

### Assets

* [**Source code** (zip)](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/archive/v7.12.3.zip)
* [**Source code** (tar.gz)](https://github.com/salesagility/SuiteCRM/archive/v7.12.3.tar.gz)

### Release Notes

Important - This release resolves an important issue with UTF-8 encoding. Data created from 7.10.30 and 7.11.19 onwards may be wrongly encoded on your database and could therefore result in search issues.
To resolve these issues please run the new 'Repair utf encoding' option on the Repair actions via the Admin Tools menu or through Robo CLI.

#### Repairing utf8 data

Important: We have verified an issue with the UTF-8 repair tool marking valid email addresses as deleted. As such, we would discourage users from using the 'Repair utf encoding' option on the Repair actions via the Admin Tools menu or related Robo CLI commands on this version. Please note this is resolved from 7.12.4, please upgrade to this version or above to make use of this feature.

##### Intro

Before running the utf8 data repair command, please have the following into account:

* Please make sure to backup your database before you run this action
* The data on your tables is going to be updated

###### Execution modes

The data repair can be executed in two modes: `asynchronous` and `synchronous`

**Asynchronous**

* Default execution mode
* It adds a job to the job queue.
* It will normalize records in batches.
* It requires cron to be configured.

**Synchronous**

* Optional. Can be used in `Robo CLI` and in the `Repair administration menu`
* It will repair data on all records in one pass.
* Both `Robo CLI` and `UI page` will only end after all records are repaired

##### Running using Robo CLI

To run using robo, use the following command:

`./vendor/bin/robo repair:normalize-record-encoding`

To run run using robo in `synchronous` run the command with the `--sync-run`

`./vendor/bin/robo repair:normalize-record-encoding --sync-run`

For information on more options run:

`./vendor/bin/robo repair:normalize-record-encoding --help`

##### Running using the UI

* Login as admin user
* Go to `Administration` page
* Go to `Repair`
* Go to `Repair utf encoding`
* Please read the warning messages
* Optional: Change the settings on the page
* Click Submit
* You’ll see different output depending on the execution mode you’ve selected
