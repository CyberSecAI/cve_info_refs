Based on the provided content, here's the breakdown of CVE-2021-45466:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies within the API section of the CentOS Web Panel (CWP) where a file write operation is possible. Specifically, the `add_server` API endpoint allows writing arbitrary content to a file.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities Present:**
- **Unrestricted File Write:** The `add_server` API endpoint allows writing to a file, specified by the `fileFinal` parameter, without proper sanitization or validation. This enables an attacker to write arbitrary content to a file.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- **Arbitrary File Write:** An attacker can write malicious code to a file on the server.
- **Remote Code Execution (RCE):** When combined with the file inclusion vulnerability (CVE-2021-45467), this can lead to pre-authenticated remote code execution as root. This is achieved by first writing a PHP file containing malicious code and then including the file using the file inclusion vulnerability.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **Network:** The vulnerability is exploited by sending HTTP requests to the vulnerable CWP instance.
- **API Endpoint:** The `add_server` API endpoint is the specific target.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- **Unauthenticated Access:** The attacker can exploit this vulnerability without authentication *after* they have registered an API key using the file inclusion vulnerability (CVE-2021-45467).
- **Knowledge of API Endpoint:** The attacker needs to know the API endpoint and parameters to use for writing to the file.
- **Ability to Craft HTTP Requests:** The attacker needs to be able to craft and send HTTP requests with malicious parameters.

**Details compared to the official CVE description**
The provided content offers significantly more detail than a typical CVE description. It outlines the exact vulnerability, its location in the `add_server` API endpoint, how to exploit it, the necessary preconditions, and how it can be chained with another vulnerability to achieve full RCE. It also explains the initial bypass used for the file inclusion vulnerability (CVE-2021-45467).
