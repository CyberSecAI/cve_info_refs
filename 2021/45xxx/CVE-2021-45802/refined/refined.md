The provided content relates to multiple CVEs. Here's a breakdown of the information related to **CVE-2021-45802**:

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
- The iResturant application does not sanitize the `email` and `phone` parameters when registering a new member.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- SQL Injection vulnerability due to unsanitized user input being directly used in a SQL query.
- The code directly concatenates user-provided input (`$email`, `$phone`) into the SQL query string without using prepared statements or parameterized queries.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- An attacker can execute arbitrary SQL queries on the database. This could lead to:
    - Data exfiltration (retrieving sensitive data)
    - Data manipulation (modifying or deleting data)
    - Potential for complete database compromise.
    - Possible unauthorized access to other parts of the system if other vulnerabilities are present.

**Attack vectors:**
- The vulnerability is exploited through the `my_signup.php` page of the iResturant application.
- An attacker can manipulate the `email` and `phone` parameters sent to the server via an HTTP POST request.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- The attacker does not necessarily need to be logged in or have existing credentials, since it is triggered during the registration process.
- The attacker needs to have basic knowledge of SQL injection techniques.

**Additional Details:**
- The provided proof of concept includes a time-based SQL injection payload `a' AND (SELECT 8666 FROM (SELECT(SLEEP(5)))hhmy) AND 'ROfB'='ROfB`.
- This payload attempts to make the database server sleep for 5 seconds, which is a common technique to confirm the existence of SQL injection.
