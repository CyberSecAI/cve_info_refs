The provided content is related to CVE-2021-45389.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The Update Manager in affected StarWind products allows authentication with a JWT (JSON Web Token) that can be signed with any key, including a self-signed key.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- Improper validation of JWT signatures.
- Authentication bypass due to the ability to use self-signed JWT tokens.

**Impact of exploitation:**
An attacker can bypass authentication and escalate privileges by using a self-signed JWT token. This can lead to unauthorized access and control over the affected systems.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack vector is network-based. The attacker needs to send a crafted self-signed JWT token to the Update Manager.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker does not need any prior authentication or special privileges. They only need to be able to communicate with the Update Manager.
