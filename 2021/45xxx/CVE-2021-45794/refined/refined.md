Based on the provided content, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability:

**Root Cause:**
- The vulnerability lies in the `backup.php` file within the `/admin/modules/system/` directory. The `id` parameter, obtained through a GET request, is not properly sanitized before being used in a SQL query.

**Weaknesses/Vulnerabilities:**
- **SQL Injection:** The primary vulnerability is SQL injection. The code directly incorporates the `id` parameter into a SQL query without adequate sanitization or parameterization.

**Impact of Exploitation:**
- An attacker can manipulate the `id` parameter to inject malicious SQL code. This can allow them to:
    - Extract sensitive data from the database.
    - Modify or delete data within the database.
    - Potentially gain further access to the system depending on database user permissions.

**Attack Vectors:**
- **HTTP GET Request:** The attack vector is through a GET request to the `backup.php` file. The vulnerable `id` parameter is appended to the URL.
- **Vulnerable Parameter:** The specific parameter targeted is the `id` parameter.

**Required Attacker Capabilities/Position:**
- The attacker needs to be able to send HTTP requests to the vulnerable web application.
- They need to know or discover the vulnerable URL structure `/admin/modules/system/backup.php?action=download&id=1`.
- No authentication is explicitly mentioned in the provided text, which might indicate the vulnerability could be exploited without prior login.

**Technical Details:**
- The vulnerable code snippet is:
  ```php
  if(isset($_GET['action']) && isset($_GET['id']) && $_GET['action'] == 'download'){
      $id = utility::filterData('id', 'get', true, true, true);
      $_q = $dbs->query("SELECT backup_file FROM backup_log WHERE backup_log_id=".$id);
      $path = $_q->fetch_row()[0];
  }
  ```
- The issue is that the `utility::filterData` function appears not to be sufficient to prevent SQL injection, despite its intended purpose to "filter" the data.
- The SQL query uses string concatenation to insert the `id` into the query instead of using parameterized queries, which opens the vulnerability.

**Additional Information**
- The provided text includes SQL injection payloads used to test the vulnerability, including boolean-based blind and time-based blind injection techniques.
- There's a comment that the issue might not be exploitable at a certain level of testing, however, the original issue report clearly indicates a SQL injection vulnerability in a specific version, so this should not discount the original report.
- The issue was closed by a collaborator, however, based on the information provided it is not clear if the underlying issue was fully resolved.
