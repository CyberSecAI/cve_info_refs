- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application fails to properly sanitize user-supplied input for the `title` parameter, which is then reflected in the HTML output within a tag attribute.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Reflected Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
- **Impact of exploitation:** An attacker can inject malicious JavaScript code into the web page, which will then be executed in the context of the victim's browser. This can allow the attacker to steal cookies, redirect users to malicious websites, or perform other malicious actions.
- **Attack vectors:** The attack vector is through a crafted URL, where the vulnerable title parameter is included. This could be disseminated via a link in an email, etc.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs to be able to craft a malicious URL with the payload in the `title` parameter and trick a victim into accessing the URL.
