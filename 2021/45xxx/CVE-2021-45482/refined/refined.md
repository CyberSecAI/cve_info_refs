Based on the provided information, here's a breakdown of the vulnerability associated with CVE-2021-45482:

**Vulnerability:** Use-after-free

**Root Cause:** The vulnerability lies in the `WebCore::ContainerNode::firstChild` function within WebKitGTK and WPE WebKit. A crafted HTML file can trigger a scenario where a `WebCore::SVGSymbolElement` is freed, but a pointer to it is still held and later accessed by `WebCore::ContainerNode::firstChild`.

**Weaknesses:**
*   **Use-After-Free:** The core weakness is a classic use-after-free. A memory location is freed but later accessed.
*   The vulnerability occurs within the SVG handling of the web browser, specifically during processing of `<symbol>` and `<use>` elements

**Impact:**
*   **Memory Corruption:** The primary impact is memory corruption, which can lead to unpredictable behavior, including crashes.
*  **Potential Code Execution:** As is typical with use-after-free vulnerabilities, this can potentially be leveraged for arbitrary code execution if an attacker can carefully control memory layout and the values at the freed memory location.

**Attack Vector:**
*   **Malicious Web Content:** The attack vector involves processing maliciously crafted web content. This content would exploit the vulnerability to cause the use-after-free condition.
*   Specifically, the provided information highlights the use of a malicious HTML file containing SVG elements.

**Attacker Capabilities:**
*   The attacker needs to be able to get the victim to load a maliciously crafted HTML file using WebKitGTK or WPE WebKit before version 2.32.4. This may involve getting the victim to browse to a malicious webpage, or opening a malicious HTML file directly.

**Technical Details:**

The provided ASan (AddressSanitizer) output clearly demonstrates the sequence of events:
1.  A `WebCore::SVGSymbolElement` is allocated.
2.  The `WebCore::SVGSymbolElement` is freed.
3.  Later, during layout and style resolution, `WebCore::ContainerNode::firstChild` tries to access the freed memory. This access happens when  `WebCore::SVGUseElement::cloneTarget()` tries to clone content from a `<symbol>` element, triggering a call to `WebCore::Traversal<WebCore::SVGElement>::firstWithin`. This ultimately tries to access the `firstChild` of a container node.

The vulnerability is triggered by a crafted HTML file using SVG `<symbol>` and `<use>` elements. When processing these, the `WebCore::ContainerNode::firstChild`  is called after the associated memory has already been freed.
