```
- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The application does not filter uploaded content, specifically in the documents.php file. This allows an attacker to upload a malicious PHP file.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** Unrestricted file upload, lack of input sanitization/validation.
- **Impact of exploitation:** Remote code execution on the server.
- **Attack vectors:** An attacker can upload a malicious PHP file through the file upload functionality in documents.php
- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker does not need to authenticate. The attacker only needs to send a POST request with the malicious PHP file.
