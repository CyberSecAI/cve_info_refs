This document describes a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting multiple NETGEAR router, extender, and WiFi system models.

**Root cause of vulnerability:** The vulnerability stems from a pre-authentication command injection flaw.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:** The primary vulnerability is a command injection which can be triggered before authentication.

**Impact of exploitation:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device. This could lead to a variety of impacts including complete device compromise, data theft, denial of service, or the device being used as part of a botnet.

**Attack vectors:** The attack can be launched remotely over a network.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:** The attacker needs network access to the vulnerable device but does not require prior authentication.
