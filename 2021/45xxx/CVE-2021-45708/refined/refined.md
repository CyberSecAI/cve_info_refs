- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The `abomonation` crate transmutes `&T` to and from `&[u8]` without sufficient constraints. This core transmute operation is easily used to violate alignment requirements.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**:
    - Violation of alignment requirements
    - Incorrect assumption that the layout of a `repr(Rust)` type is stable during serialization/deserialization.
    - Information disclosure through padding bytes.
    - Disclosure of pointer values.
- **Impact of exploitation**:
    - Memory corruption due to alignment violations.
    - Information leak of padding bytes.
    - Defeat of ASLR (Address Space Layout Randomization) due to the disclosure of pointer values.
- **Attack vectors**: Exploitation can occur by using the transmute operation to serialize/deserialize data which violates alignment or reveals sensitive data.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to be able to serialize/deserialize data using the `abomonation` crate with types and values that will trigger the vulnerabilities.
