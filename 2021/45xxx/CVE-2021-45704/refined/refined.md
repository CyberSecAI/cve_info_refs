- **Root cause of vulnerability:** The `AtomicBucket<T>` struct in the `metrics-util` crate unconditionally implemented the `Send` and `Sync` traits, even when the inner type `T` did not satisfy these traits (i.e., when `T: !Sync`). This allowed users to create data races by using the `AtomicBucket::data_with()` API to access the inner data concurrently from multiple threads when `T` was not `Sync`.

- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
    - Unconditional `Send`/`Sync` implementation for `AtomicBucket<T>`
    - Data races on the inner type `T` when it's not `Sync`.

- **Impact of exploitation:** Data races can lead to memory corruption and other undefined behavior.

- **Attack vectors:** Using the `AtomicBucket::data_with()` API to concurrently access the inner data from multiple threads when the inner type `T` is not `Sync`.

- **Required attacker capabilities/position:** An attacker needs to be able to use the affected `AtomicBucket` with a non-`Sync` type and call the `data_with()` API in a multi-threaded context.
