- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The application's `lib/comment.inc.php` file does not properly sanitize user-supplied input in the comment field before using it in an SQL query.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: SQL Injection vulnerability. Specifically, the code constructs an SQL query by concatenating user-provided data directly into the query string.
- **Impact of exploitation**: An attacker can inject arbitrary SQL code, potentially allowing them to read, modify, or delete data from the database. In the provided example, the attacker is able to retrieve the database user.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is the comment field in the application, which is accessible by authenticated users.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: The attacker needs to be an authenticated user and have the ability to post comments.
