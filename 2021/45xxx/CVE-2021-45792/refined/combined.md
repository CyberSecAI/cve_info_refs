| **Describe the bug** Storage type xss exists in Custom Field Editor in /admin/modules/system/custom\_field.php file. There is no effective defense against the NOTE field, leading to cross-site script attacks.  **To Reproduce** Steps to reproduce the behavior: Storage type xss exists in Custom Field Editor in /admin/modules/system/custom\_field.php file. There is no effective defense against the NOTE field, leading to cross-site scripting attacks. Administrator login "system" add new "field> fill in cross-site scripting in the NOTE field `(example:'"><svg/onload=alert(document.domain)>)` It will take effect after saving.  **Expected behavior** You can insert js scripts to attack.  **Screenshots** [3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18564938/147060823-4a8328b5-9ea5-400a-80d2-48c4a8828895.png) [4](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/18564938/147060883-f5af4b94-3587-4dee-9e94-45415050b3eb.png)  **Desktop :**   * OS: [MacBook M1] * Browser [Chrome] * Version [96.0.4664.110] |
