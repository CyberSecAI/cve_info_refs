  "vulnerability_details": {
    "root_cause": "The vulnerability is a stored cross-site scripting (XSS) issue found in the web interface of several NETGEAR router models.",
    "weaknesses": [
      "Stored Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)"
    ],
    "impact": "Successful exploitation could allow an attacker to inject malicious scripts into the router's web interface. This could lead to a variety of actions, including session hijacking, unauthorized access, or redirection to malicious websites.",
    "attack_vectors": "The vulnerability is exploited via the router's web interface. An attacker would need to find a way to inject malicious script into a field that is stored and later displayed to users.",
    "required_capabilities": "The attacker would need to have some level of access to the router's configuration settings, likely requiring authentication. The specific injection point is not detailed but would need to be a user-controllable field that is not properly sanitized when rendered."
