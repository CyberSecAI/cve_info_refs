SUMMARY

SICAM TOOLBOX II contains a vulnerability that could allow an attacker access through a circumventable
access control.

Siemens recommends countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not yet available.

AFFECTED PRODUCTS AND SOLUTION

Affected Product and Versions

Remediation

SICAM TOOLBOX II:
All versions

Currently no ﬁx is planned

Install hotﬁx V7.01 HF01 [3]. Among other things,
this update will disable the port 1522 in the ORA-
CLE conﬁguration ﬁle LISTENER.ORA by default.
The currently installed and/or from customer mod-
iﬁed conﬁguration ﬁle LISTENER.ORA is backed
up. See the release notes for more information.

en/view/109811251
Alternatively, restrict port 1522/tcp access to lo-
calhost or speciﬁc ip<br/> addresses only, as doc-
umented in the updated security manual (chapter
3.6.7) [1], which is also included in the SICAM
TOOLBOX II, V07.01 package [2]

WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS

Product speciﬁc remediations or mitigations can be found in the section Affected Products and Solution.
Please follow the General Security Recommendations.

GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS

Operators of critical power systems (e.g. TSOs or DSOs) worldwide are usually required by regulations
to build resilience into the power grids by applying multi-level redundant secondary protection schemes.
It is therefore recommended that the operators check whether appropriate resilient protection measures
are in place. The risk of cyber incidents impacting the grid’s reliability can thus be minimized by virtue of
the grid design.

Siemens strongly recommends applying the provided security updates using the corresponding tooling
and documented procedures made available with the product. If supported by the product, an automated
means to apply the security updates across multiple product instances may be used. Siemens strongly

recommends prior validation of any security update before being applied, and supervision by trained staff
of the update process in the target environment.

As a general security measure Siemens strongly recommends to protect network access with appropriate
mechanisms (e.g. ﬁrewalls, segmentation, VPN). It is advised to conﬁgure the environment according to
our operational guidelines in order to run the devices in a protected IT environment.

PRODUCT DESCRIPTION

SICAM TOOLBOX II is an engineering solution for plants and systems of all sizes. It allows data collection,
data modeling, conﬁguration, and parameterization. It is used for engineering of process information for
the automation and central control-room systems.

VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION

The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1) (https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s
environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
https://cwe.mitre.org/.

Vulnerability CVE-2021-45106

Affected applications use a circumventable access control within a database service. This could allow
an attacker to access the database.
