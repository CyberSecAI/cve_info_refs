- **Root cause of vulnerability**: The vulnerability stems from a circumventable access control mechanism within a database service used by SICAM TOOLBOX II.
- **Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present**: Improper access control, potentially related to the use of hard-coded credentials (CWE-798). The vulnerability allows an attacker to bypass the intended access controls and interact with the database. Specifically, the vulnerability is associated with the Oracle database listener port 1522.
- **Impact of exploitation**: Successful exploitation allows an attacker to access the database, which could lead to unauthorized access to sensitive data, data manipulation, or other malicious activities within the system. The impact is rated as having high confidentiality, integrity, and availability consequences.
- **Attack vectors**: The attack vector is network-based, suggesting the attacker can exploit the vulnerability remotely if the port 1522 is exposed.
- **Required attacker capabilities/position**: An attacker needs to have network access to the vulnerable system and potentially some level of access (low privilege) to exploit this vulnerability.

The advisory recommends disabling the port 1522, restricting access to localhost or specific IPs, and to refer to the updated security manual for more information.
