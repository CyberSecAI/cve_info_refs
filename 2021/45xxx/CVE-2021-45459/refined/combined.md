This library can be used to install/start/stop/uninstall Node scripts as Windows background services for **production** environments. This is not a tool for developing applications, it is a tool for releasing them. This tool generates an executable that will run your app with whichever version of Node.js is installed on the computer.

See [node-mac](http://github.com/coreybutler/node-mac) and [node-linux](http://github.com/coreybutler/node-linux) if you need to support those operating systems.

## Overview

The following features are available in node-windows:

* **Service Management**: Run Node.js scripts as native Windows services. Includes monitoring.
* **Event Logging**: Create logs in the Event log.
* **Commands**:
  + *Elevated Permissions*: Run a command with elevated privileges (may prompt user for acceptance)
  + *Sudo*: Run an `exec` command as a sudoer.
  + *Identify Administrative Privileges*: Determines whether the current user has administrative privileges.
  + *List Tasks*: A method to list running windows tasks/services.
  + *Kill Task*: A method to kill a specific windows service/task (by PID).

## Installation

The recommended way to install node-windows is with npm, using the global flag:

`npm install -g node-windows`

Then, in your project root, run:

`npm link node-windows`

However; it is possible to use node-windows without the global flag (i.e. install directly into the project root).
More details regarding why this is not the recommended approach are available throughout this Readme.

## NO NATIVE MODULES

Using native node modules on Windows can suck. Most native modules are not distributed in a binary format.
Instead, these modules rely on `npm` to build the project, utilizing [node-gyp](https://github.com/TooTallNate/node-gyp).
This means developers need to have Visual Studio (and potentially other software) installed on the system,
just to install a native module. This is portable, but painful... mostly because Visual Studio
itself is over 2GB.

**node-windows does not use native modules.** There are some binary/exe utilities, but everything
needed to run more complex tasks is packaged and distributed in a readily usable format. So, no need for
Visual Studio... at least not for this module.

# Windows Services

node-windows has a utility to run Node.js scripts as Windows services. Please note that like all
Windows services, creating one requires administrative privileges. To create a service with
node-windows, prepare a script like:

```
var Service = require('node-windows').Service;

// Create a new service object
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',
  script: 'C:\\path\\to\\helloworld.js',
  nodeOptions: [
    '--harmony',
    '--max_old_space_size=4096'
  ]
  //, workingDirectory: '...'
  //, allowServiceLogon: true
});

// Listen for the "install" event, which indicates the
// process is available as a service.
svc.on('install',function(){
  svc.start();
});

svc.install();
```

The code above creates a new `Service` object, providing a pretty name and description.
The `script` attribute identifies the Node.js script that should run as a service. Upon running
this, the script will be visible from the Windows Services utility.

[![Windows Service](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ddd5b25109d7cf5a70e515fdca858da4155f57ecf53310b7729a19d11f1df669/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f636f7265796275746c65722f6e6f64652d77696e646f77732f6d61737465722f646f63732f736572766963652e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ddd5b25109d7cf5a70e515fdca858da4155f57ecf53310b7729a19d11f1df669/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f636f7265796275746c65722f6e6f64652d77696e646f77732f6d61737465722f646f63732f736572766963652e706e67)

The `Service` object emits the following events:

* *install* - Fired when the script is installed as a service.
* *alreadyinstalled* - Fired if the script is already known to be a service.
* *invalidinstallation* - Fired if an installation is detected but missing required files.
* *uninstall* - Fired when an uninstallation is complete.
* *alreadyuninstalled* - Fired when an uninstall is requested and no installation exists.
* *start* - Fired when the new service is started.
* *stop* - Fired when the service is stopped.
* *error* - Fired in some instances when an error occurs.

In the example above, the script listens for the `install` event. Since this event
is fired when a service installation is complete, it is safe to start the service.

Services created by node-windows are similar to most other services running on Windows.
They can be started/stopped from the windows service utility, via `NET START` or `NET STOP` commands,
or even managed using the [sc](http://technet.microsoft.com/en-us/library/dd228922%28v%3Dws.10%29.aspx)
utility.

### Command-line Options

It may be desired to specify command-line switches to your script. You can do this by setting the `scriptOptions` within the service config:

```
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',
  script: 'C:\\path\\to\\helloworld.js',
  scriptOptions: '-c C:\\path\\to\\somewhere\\special -i'
});
```

### Environment Variables

Sometimes you may want to provide a service with static data, passed in on creation of the service. You can do this by setting environment variables in the service config, as shown below:

```
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',
  script: 'C:\\path\\to\\helloworld.js',
  env: {
    name: "HOME",
    value: process.env["USERPROFILE"] // service is now able to access the user who created its' home directory
  }
});
```

You can also supply an array to set multiple environment variables:

```
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',
  script: 'C:\\path\\to\\helloworld.js',
  env: [{
    name: "HOME",
    value: process.env["USERPROFILE"] // service is now able to access the user who created its' home directory
  },
  {
    name: "TEMP",
    value: path.join(process.env["USERPROFILE"],"/temp") // use a temp directory in user's home directory
  }]
});
```

### Node Executable Path

There are times when you may want to specify a specific `node` executable to use to run your script. You can do this by setting the `execPath` in the service config, as shown below:

```
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',
  script: 'C:\\path\\to\\helloworld.js',
  execPath: 'C:\\path\\to\\specific\\node.exe'
});
```

### User Account Attributes

If you need to specify a specific user or particular credentials to manage a service, the following
attributes may be helpful.

The `user` attribute is an object with three keys: `domain`,`account`, and `password`.
This can be used to identify which user the service library should use to perform system commands.
By default, the domain is set to the local computer name, but it can be overridden with an Active Directory
or LDAP domain. For example:

**app.js**

```
var Service = require('node-windows').Service;

// Create a new service object
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  script: require('path').join(__dirname,'helloworld.js'),
  //, allowServiceLogon: true
});

svc.logOnAs.domain = 'mydomain.local';
svc.logOnAs.account = 'username';
svc.logOnAs.password = 'password';
...
```

Both the account and password must be explicitly defined if you want the service module to
run commands as a specific user. By default, it will run using the user account that launched
the process (i.e. who launched `node app.js`).

If you want to instruct winsw to allow service account logins, specify `allowServiceLogon: true`. This is disabled by default since some users have experienced issues running this without service logons.

The other attribute is `sudo`. This attribute has a single property called `password`. By supplying
this, the service module will attempt to run commands using the user account that launched the
process and the password for that account. This should only be used for accounts with administrative
privileges.

**app.js**

```
var Service = require('node-windows').Service;

// Create a new service object
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  script: require('path').join(__dirname,'helloworld.js')
});

svc.sudo.password = 'password';
...
```

### Depending on other services

The service can also be made dependant on other Windows services.

```
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',
  script: 'C:\\path\\to\\helloworld.js',
  dependsOn: ["serviceA"]
});
```

### Cleaning Up: Uninstall a Service

Uninstalling a previously created service is syntactically similar to installation.

```
var Service = require('node-windows').Service;

// Create a new service object
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  script: require('path').join(__dirname,'helloworld.js')
});

// Listen for the "uninstall" event so we know when it's done.
svc.on('uninstall',function(){
  console.log('Uninstall complete.');
  console.log('The service exists: ',svc.exists);
});

// Uninstall the service.
svc.uninstall();
```

The uninstall process only removes process-specific files. **It does NOT delete your Node.js script!**

### What Makes node-windows Services Unique?

Lots of things!

**Long Running Processes & Monitoring:**

The built-in service recovery for Windows services is fairly limited and cannot easily be configured
from code. Therefore, node-windows creates a wrapper around the Node.js script. This wrapper
is responsible for restarting a failed service in an intelligent and configurable manner. For example,
if your script crashes due to an unknown error, node-windows will attempt to restart it. By default,
this occurs every second. However; if the script has a fatal flaw that makes it crash repeatedly,
it adds unnecessary overhead to the system. node-windows handles this by increasing the time interval
between restarts and capping the maximum number of restarts.

**Smarter Restarts That Won't Pummel Your Server:**

Using the default settings, node-windows adds 25% to the wait interval each time it needs to restart
the script. With the default setting (1 second), the first restart attempt occurs after one second.
The second occurs after 1.25 seconds. The third after 1.56 seconds (1.25 increased by 25%) and so on.
Both the initial wait time and the growth rate are configuration options that can be passed to a new
`Service`. For example:

```
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',
  script: 'C:\\path\\to\\helloworld.js',
  wait: 2,
  grow: .5
});
```

In this example, the wait period will start at 2 seconds and increase by 50%. So, the second attempt
would be 3 seconds later while the fourth would be 4.5 seconds later.

**Don't DOS Yourself!**

Repetitive recycling could potentially go on forever with a bad script. To handle these situations, node-windows
supports two kinds of caps. Using `maxRetries` will cap the maximum number of restart attempts. By
default, this is unlimited. Setting it to 3 would tell the process to no longer restart a process
after it has failed 3 times. Another option is `maxRestarts`, which caps the number of restarts attempted
within 60 seconds. For example, if this is set to 3 (the default) and the process crashes/restarts repeatedly,
node-windows will cease restart attempts after the 3rd cycle in a 60 second window. Both of these
configuration options can be set, just like `wait` or `grow`.

Finally, an attribute called `abortOnError` can be set to `true` if you want your script to **not** restart
at all when it exits with an error.

### How Services Are Made

node-windows uses the [winsw](https://github.com/kohsuke/winsw) utility to create a unique `.exe`
for each Node.js script deployed as a service. A directory called `daemon` is created and populated
with `myappname.exe` and `myappname.xml`. The XML file is a configuration for the executable. Additionally,
`winsw` will create some logs for itself in this directory (which are viewable in the Event log).

The `myappname.exe` file launches the node-windows wrapper, which is responsible for monitoring and managing
the script. Since this file is a part of node-windows, moving the node-windows directory could result in
the `.exe` file not being able to find the Node.js script. However; this should not be a problem if
node-windows is installed globally, per the recommended installation instructions.

All of these daemon-specific files are created in a subdirectory called `daemon`, which is created in the
same directory where the Node.js script is saved. Uninstalling a service will remove these files.

*Event Logging*

Services created with node-windows have two event logs that can be viewed through the Windows Event Viewer.
A log source named `myappname.exe` provides basic logging for the executable file. It can be used to see
when the entire service starts/stops or has errors. A second log, named after your service name (i.e. My App Name),
is used by the node-windows monitor. It is possible to write to this log from the Node.js script using
the node-windows Event Logging.

# Event Logging

New as of `v0.1.0` is a *non-C++* based event logging utility. This utility can write to the event log,
making your logs visible from the Event Viewer. It uses [eventcreate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/eventcreate) under the hood.

To create a logger:

```
var EventLogger = require('node-windows').EventLogger;

var log = new EventLogger('Hello World');

log.info('Basic information.');
log.warn('Watch out!');
log.error('Something went wrong.');
```

Looks similar to:

[![Event Logging in node-windows](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/302fafcd9ea4bd00e023123db1d98c7340ea3eb66a744641a93f1204ab908baf/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f636f7265796275746c65722f6e6f64652d77696e646f77732f6d61737465722f646f63732f6576656e746c6f672e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/302fafcd9ea4bd00e023123db1d98c7340ea3eb66a744641a93f1204ab908baf/68747470733a2f2f7261772e6769746875622e636f6d2f636f7265796275746c65722f6e6f64652d77696e646f77732f6d61737465722f646f63732f6576656e746c6f672e706e67)

Some lesser-used options are also available through node-windows event logging.

```
log.auditSuccess('AUser Login Success');
log.auditFailure('AUser Login Failure');
```

Each log type (info, warn, error, auditSuccess, and auditFailure) method optionally accepts two additional
arguments, including a *code* and *callback*. By default, the event code is `1000` if not otherwise specified.
To provide a custom event code with a log message and write that message to the console, the following code could
be used:

> **Notice:** It appears [eventcreate](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows-server/administration/windows-commands/eventcreate) only supports custom ID's <=1000.

```
log.info('Something different happened!', 700, function(){
  console.log('Something different happened!');
});
```

By default, event logs are all part of the `APPLICATION` scope. However; it is also possible to use the `SYSTEM` log.
To do this, a configuration object must be passed to the new log:

```
var EventLogger = require('node-windows').EventLogger;
var log = new EventLogger({
  source: 'My Event Log',
  eventLog: 'SYSTEM'
});
```

Warning event logs that are produced by the wrapper can be suppressed by disabling it when creating the service.
Warning logs are enabled by default.

```
var svc = new Service({
  name:'Hello World',
  description: 'The nodejs.org example web server.',
  disableWarningLogs: true,
});
```

# Commands

node-windows ships with several commands to simplify tasks on MS Windows.

## elevate

Elevate is similar to `sudo` on Linux/Mac. It attempts to elevate the privileges of the
current user to a local administrator. Using this does not require a password, but it
does require that the current user have administrative privileges. Without these
privileges, the command will fail with a `access denied` error.

On systems with UAC enabled, this may prompt the user for permission to proceed:

[![UAC Prompt](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ad966dd2ea16bec11b0687f5f8d5536980597a1729d48e4f4db028db663511f3/687474703a2f2f75706c6f61642e77696b696d656469612e6f72672f77696b6970656469612f656e2f352f35312f57696e646f77735f375f5541432e706e67)](https://camo.githubusercontent.com/ad966dd2ea16bec11b0687f5f8d5536980597a1729d48e4f4db028db663511f3/687474703a2f2f75706c6f61642e77696b696d656469612e6f72672f77696b6970656469612f656e2f352f35312f57696e646f77735f375f5541432e706e67)

**Syntax**:

`elevate(cmd[,options,callback])`

* *cmd*: The command to execute with elevated privileges. This can be any string that would be typed at the command line.
* *options* (optional): Any options that will be passed to `require('child_process').exec(cmd,<OPTIONS>,callback)`.
* *callback* (optional): The callback function passed to `require('child_process').exec(cmd,options,<CALLBACK>)`.

## sudo

Sudo acts similarly to `sudo` on Linux/Mac. Unlike *elevate*, it requires a password, but it
will not prompt the user for permission to proceed. Like *elevate*, this
*still requires administrative privileges* for the user, otherwise the command will fail.
The primary difference between this and *elevate()* is the prompt.

**Syntax**:

`sudo(cmd,password[,options,callback])`

* *cmd*: The command to execute with elevated privileges. This can be any string that would be typed at the command line.
* *password*: The password of the user
* *options* (optional): Any options that will be passed to `require('child_process').exec(cmd,<OPTIONS>,callback)`.
* *callback* (optional): The callback function passed to `require('child_process').exec(cmd,options,<CALLBACK>)`.

## isAdminUser

This asynchronous command determines whether the current user has administrative privileges.
It passes a boolean value to the callback, returning `true` if the user is an administrator
or `false` if it is not.

**Example**

```
var wincmd = require('node-windows');

wincmd.isAdminUser(function(isAdmin){
  if (isAdmin) {
    console.log('The user has administrative privileges.');
  } else {
    console.log('NOT AN ADMIN');
  }
});
```

## list

The list method queries the operating system for a list of running processes.

```
var wincmd = require('node-windows');

wincmd.list(function(svc){
  console.log(svc);
},true);
```

This returns an array of running processes. Supplying the optional `true`
argument in the above example provides a list with verbose output. The output is
specific to the version of the operating system. Here is an example of verbose
output on a Windows 8 computer.

```
[{
  ImageName: 'cmd.exe',
  PID: '12440',
  SessionName: 'Console',
  'Session#': '1',
  MemUsage: '1,736 K',
  Status: 'Unknown',
  UserName: 'Machine\\Corey',
  CPUTime: '0:00:00',
  WindowTitle: 'N/A'
},{
  ImageName: 'tasklist.exe',
  PID: '1652',
  SessionName: 'Console',
  'Session#': '1',
  MemUsage: '8,456 K',
  Status: 'Unknown',
  UserName: 'Machine\\Corey',
  CPUTime: '0:00:00',
  WindowTitle: 'N/A'
}]
```

The regular (non-verbose) output typically provides the `ImageName`,`PID`,`SessionName`,
`Session#`, `MemUsage`, and `CPUTime`.

## kill

This method will kill a process by `PID`.

```
var wincmd = require('node-windows');

wincmd.kill(12345,function(){
  console.log('Process Killed');
});
```

In this example, process ID `12345` would be killed. It is important to note that the
user account executing this node script may require administrative privileges.

# Troubleshooting

If you're experiencing issues with the examples, please review the `TESTS.md` file.

If you are encountering the *invalidinstallation* event, take a look at the `daemon`
directory that is created during the installation to make sure the `.exe` and `.xml`
files are there. In some circumstances, primarily during \_un\_installation, it is
possbile for the process to temporarily lock a log file, which prevents Windows
from removing it. In this scenario, simply run the uninstall again. In most cases this
will fix the issue. If not, manually remove the `daemon` directory before running the
installation again.

# Thank You

There have been many contributors who have done everything from committing features to helping pick up slack while I've been swamped. I'm incredibly appreciative for the help.

Special thanks to @arthurblake whose modifications have FINALLY been added. Thanks to @hockeytim11, who helped compile and update a bunch of outstanding issues and started bringing support to the other node-\* libraries.

NetApp has a long-held and ongoing commitment to compliance with the ever-evolving set of global, regional, and data security and privacy standards and regulations. We uphold this commitment through self-assessments and rigorous audits by independent accredited third parties.

These assessments help demonstrate NetApp’s integration of internationally recognized processes and best practices in our business, enabling customers to use our products and services regardless of their compliance needs.

NetApp supplies information for each compliance offering (listed at left) that includes a list of in-scope software and hardware and links to the relevant certificates and auditor’s reports.

# CVSS v3 base metrics

Attack vector:
More severe the more the remote (logically and physically) an attacker can be in order to exploit the vulnerability.

Attack complexity:
More severe for the least complex attacks.

Privileges required:
More severe if no privileges are required.

User interaction:
More severe when no user interaction is required.

Scope:
More severe when a scope change occurs, e.g. one vulnerable component impacts resources in components beyond its security scope.

Confidentiality:
More severe when loss of data confidentiality is highest, measuring the level of data access available to an unauthorized user.

Integrity:
More severe when loss of data integrity is the highest, measuring the consequence of data modification possible by an unauthorized user.

Availability:
More severe when the loss of impacted component availability is highest.

### Frequently asked questions

#### General

#### What is GitHub Copilot?

GitHub Copilot transforms the developer experience. Backed by the leaders in AI, Copilot provides contextualized assistance throughout the software development lifecycle, from code completions and chat assistance in the IDE to code explanations and answers to docs in GitHub and more. With Copilot elevating their workflow, developers can focus on more: value, innovation, and happiness.

GitHub Copilot enables developers to focus more energy on problem solving and collaboration and spend less effort on the mundane and boilerplate. That’s why developers who use Copilot report up to 75% higher satisfaction with their jobs than those who don’t and are up to 55% more productive at writing code without sacrifice to quality, which all adds up to engaged developers shipping great software faster.

GitHub Copilot integrates with leading editors, including Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, JetBrains IDEs, and Neovim, and, unlike other AI coding assistants, is natively built into GitHub. Growing to millions of individual users and tens of thousands of business customers, Copilot is the world’s most widely adopted AI developer tool and the competitive advantage developers ask for by name.

#### Who is eligible to access GitHub Copilot for free?

GitHub Copilot Free is a new free pricing tier with limited functionality for individual developers. Users assigned a Copilot Business or Copilot Enterprise seat are not eligible for access. Users with access to Copilot Pro through a paid subscription, trial, or through an existing verified OSS, Student, Faculty, or MVP account may elect to use Free instead.

#### What languages, IDEs, and platforms does GitHub Copilot support?

GitHub Copilot is trained on all languages that appear in public repositories. For each language, the quality of suggestions you receive may depend on the volume and diversity of training data for that language. For example, JavaScript is well-represented in public repositories and is one of GitHub Copilot’s best supported languages. Languages with less representation in public repositories may produce fewer or less robust suggestions.

GitHub Copilot is available as an extension in Visual Studio Code, Visual Studio, Vim, Neovim, the JetBrains suite of IDEs, and Azure Data Studio. Although code completion functionality is available across all these extensions, chat functionality is currently available only in Visual Studio Code, JetBrains and Visual Studio. GitHub Copilot is also supported in terminals through GitHub CLI and as a chat integration in Windows Terminal Canary. With the GitHub Copilot Enterprise plan, GitHub Copilot is natively integrated into GitHub.com. All plans are supported in GitHub Copilot in GitHub Mobile. GitHub Mobile for Copilot Pro and Copilot Business have access to Bing and public repository code search. Copilot Enterprise in GitHub Mobile gives you additional access to your organization's knowledge.

#### Does GitHub Copilot “copy/paste”?

No, GitHub Copilot generates suggestions using probabilistic determination.

* When thinking about intellectual property and open source issues, it is critical to understand how GitHub Copilot really works. The AI models that create Copilot’s suggestions may be trained on public code, but do not contain any code. When they generate a suggestion, they are not “copying and pasting” from any codebase.
* To generate a code suggestion, the Copilot extension begins by examining the code in your editor—focusing on the lines just before and after your cursor, but also information including other files open in your editor and the URLs of repositories or file paths to identify relevant context. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat in the code editor, the Copilot extension creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including the code file open in your active document, your code selection, and general workspace information, such as frameworks, languages, and dependencies. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.
* To generate a suggestion for chat on GitHub.com, such as providing an answer to a question from your chat prompt, Copilot creates a contextual prompt by combining your prompt with additional context including previous prompts, the open pages on GitHub.com as well as retrieved context from your codebase or Bing search. That information is sent to Copilot’s model, to make a probabilistic determination of what is likely to come next and generate suggestions.

#### What are the differences between the GitHub Copilot Business, GitHub Copilot Enterprise, and GitHub Copilot Individual plans?

#### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

#### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.

1. Data from June 2023. Additional research can be found [here](https://github.blog/news-insights/research/the-economic-impact-of-the-ai-powered-developer-lifecycle-and-lessons-from-github-copilot/).
2. Feature in public beta for Copilot Pro and Business plans. Requires use of repositories, issues, discussions, Actions, and other features of GitHub.
3. Authentication with SAML single sign-on (SSO) available for organizations using GitHub Enterprise Cloud.

GitHub Copilot Free users are limited to 2000 completions and 50 chat requests (including Copilot Edits).

#### Which plan includes GitHub Copilot Autofix?

GitHub Copilot Autofix provides contextual explanations and code suggestions to help developers fix vulnerabilities in code, and is included in GitHub Advanced Security and available to all public repositories.

### Privacy

#### What personal data does GitHub Copilot process?

GitHub Copilot processes personal data based on how Copilot is accessed and used: whether via GitHub.com, mobile app, extensions, or one of various IDE extensions, or through features like suggestions for the command line interface (CLI), IDE code completions, or personalized chat on GitHub.com. The types of personal data processed may include:

* **User Engagement Data:** This includes pseudonymous identifiers captured on user interactions with Copilot, such as accepted or dismissed completions, error messages, system logs, and product usage metrics.
* **Prompts:** These are inputs for chat or code, along with context, sent to Copilot's AI to generate suggestions.
* **Suggestions:** These are the AI-generated code lines or chat responses provided to users based on their prompts.
* **Feedback Data:** This comprises real-time user feedback, including reactions (e.g., thumbs up/down) and optional comments, along with feedback from support tickets.

#### Does GitHub use Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train GitHub’s model?

No. GitHub does not use either Copilot Business or Enterprise data to train its models.

#### How does GitHub use the Copilot data?

How GitHub uses Copilot data depends on how the user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. Users can access GitHub Copilot through the web, extensions, mobile apps, computer terminal, and various IDEs (Integrated Development Environments). GitHub generally uses personal data to:

* Deliver, maintain, and update the services as per the customer's configuration and usage, to ensure personalized experiences and recommendations
* Troubleshoot, which involves preventing, detecting, resolving, and mitigating issues, including security incidents and product-related problems, by fixing software bugs and maintaining the online services' functionality and up-to-dateness
* Enhance user productivity, reliability, effectiveness, quality, privacy, accessibility, and security by keeping the service current and operational

These practices are outlined in GitHub’s Data Protection Agreement ([DPA)](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement), which details our data handling commitments to our data controller customers.

GitHub also uses certain personal data with customer authorization under the DPA, for the following purposes:

* Billing and account management
* To comply with and resolve legal obligations
* For abuse detection, prevention, and protection, virus scanning, and scanning to detect violations of terms of service
* To generate summary reports for calculating employee commissions and partner incentives
* To produce aggregated reports for internal use and strategic planning, covering areas like forecasting, revenue analysis, capacity planning, and product strategy,

For details on GitHub's data processing activities as a controller, particularly for Copilot Pro customers, refer to the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement).

#### How long does GitHub retain Copilot data for Business and Enterprise customers?

If and for how long GitHub’s retains Copilot data depends on how a Copilot user accesses Copilot and for what purpose. The default settings for Copilot Business and Enterprise Customers are as follows:

**Access through IDE for Chat and Code Completions:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Not retained
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

**All other GitHub Copilot access and use:**

* Prompts and Suggestions: Retained for 28 days.
* User Engagement Data: Kept for two years.
* Feedback Data: Stored for as long as needed for its intended purpose.

#### Why do some Copilot features retain prompts and suggestions?

Retaining prompts and suggestions is necessary for chat on github.com, mobile, and CLI Copilot because those features’ effectiveness depends on using thread history to improve responses. The Copilot model requires access to previous interactions to deliver accurate and relevant suggestions.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support compliance with the GDPR and other data protection laws?

Yes. GitHub and customers can enter a [Data Protection Agreement](https://github.com/customer-terms/github-data-protection-agreement) that supports compliance with the GDPR and similar legislation.

#### Does GitHub Copilot ever output personal data?

While we've designed GitHub Copilot with privacy in mind, the expansive definition of personal data under legislation like the EU’s General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) means we can't guarantee it will never output such data. The Large Language Model (LLM) powering GitHub Copilot was trained on public code and there were instances in our tests where the tool made suggestions resembling personal data. These suggestions were typically synthesized and not tied to real individuals.

#### How does Copilot allow users to access, alter or delete personal data?

These actions are available to Copilot users as described in the [GitHub Privacy Statement](https://docs.github.com/en/site-policy/privacy-policies/github-general-privacy-statement#your-privacy-rights).

### Responsible AI

#### What are the intellectual property considerations when using GitHub Copilot?

The primary IP considerations for GitHub Copilot relate to copyright. The model that powers Copilot is trained on a broad collection of publicly accessible code, which may include copyrighted code, and Copilot’s suggestions (in rare instances) may resemble the code its model was trained on. Here’s some basic information you should know about these considerations:

Copyright law permits the use of copyrighted works to train AI models:  Countries around the world have provisions in their copyright laws that enable machines to learn, understand, extract patterns, and facts from copyrighted materials, including software code. For example, the European Union, Japan, and Singapore, have express provisions permitting machine learning to develop AI models. Other countries including Canada, India, and the United States also permit such training under their fair use/fair dealing provisions. GitHub Copilot’s AI model was trained with the use of code from GitHub’s public repositories—which are publicly accessible and within the scope of permissible copyright use.

What about copyright risk in suggestions? In rare instances (less than 1% based on GitHub’s research), suggestions from GitHub may match examples of code used to train GitHub’s AI model. Again, Copilot does not “look up” or “copy and paste” code, but is instead using context from a user’s workspace to synthesize and generate a suggestion.

Our experience shows that matching suggestions are most likely to occur in two situations: (i) when there is little or no context in the code editor for Copilot’s model to synthesize, or (ii) when a matching suggestion represents a common approach or method. If a code suggestion matches existing code, there is risk that using that suggestion could trigger claims of copyright infringement, which would depend on the amount and nature of code used, and the context of how the code is used. In many ways, this is the same risk that arises when using any code that a developer does not originate, such as copying code from an online source, or reusing code from a library. That is why responsible organizations and developers recommend that users employ code scanning policies to identify and evaluate potential matching code.

In Copilot, you can opt whether to allow Copilot to suggest code completions that match publicly available code on GitHub.com. For more information, see "[Configuring GitHub Copilot settings on GitHub.com](https://docs-internal-46619-d1aa34.preview.ghdocs.com/en/copilot/configuring-github-copilot/configuring-github-copilot-settings-on-githubcom#enabling-or-disabling-duplication-detection)". If you have allowed suggestions that match public code, GitHub Copilot can provide you with details about the matching code when you accept such suggestions. Matching code does not necessarily mean copyright infringement, so it is ultimately up to the user to determine whether to use the suggestion, and what and who to attribute (along with other license compliance) in appropriate circumstances.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include a filtering mechanism to mitigate risk?

Yes, GitHub Copilot does include an optional code referencing filter to detect and suppress certain suggestions that match public code on GitHub.

* GitHub has created a duplication detection filter to detect and suppress suggestions that contain code segments over a certain length that match public code on GitHub. This filter can be enabled by the administrator for your enterprise and it can apply for all organizations within your enterprise, or the administrator can defer control to individual organizations.
* With the filter enabled, Copilot checks code suggestions for matches or near-matches against public code on GitHub of 65 lexemes or more (on average,150 characters). If there is a match, the suggestion will not be shown to the user.
* In addition to off-topic, harmful, and offensive output filters, GitHub Copilot also scans the outputs for vulnerable code.

#### Does GitHub Copilot include features to make it easier for users to identify potentially relevant open source licenses for matching suggestions?

Yes, GitHub Copilot is previewing a [code referencing feature](https://github.blog/2023-08-03-introducing-code-referencing-for-github-copilot/) as an additional tool to assist users to find and review potentially relevant open source licenses. Code referencing is currently available in Visual Studio Code. This feature searches across public GitHub repositories for code that matches a Copilot suggestion. If there’s a match, users will find its information displayed in the Copilot console log, including where the match occurred, any applicable licenses, and a deep link to learn more. The deep link will take users to a navigable page on GitHub.com to browse examples of the code match and their repository licenses, and see how many repositories—including ones without licenses—that code appears in, as well as links to those repositories. Copilot users can review this information to determine whether the applicable suggestions are suitable for use, and whether additional measures may be necessary to use them.

#### Who owns the suggestions provided by GitHub Copilot?

We don’t determine whether a suggestion is capable of being owned, but we are clear that GitHub does not claim ownership of a suggestion. Whether a suggestion generated by an AI model can be owned depends on many factors (e.g. the intellectual property law in the relevant country, the length of the suggestion, the extent that suggestion is considered ‘functional’ instead of expressive, etc).

* If a suggestion is capable of being owned, our terms are clear: GitHub does not claim ownership.
* GitHub does not claim ownership of any suggestion. In certain cases, it is possible for Copilot to produce similar suggestions to different users. For example, two unrelated users both starting new files to code the quicksort algorithm in Java will likely get the same suggestion. The possibility of providing similar suggestions to multiple users is a common part of generative AI systems.

#### Can GitHub Copilot introduce insecure code in its suggestions?

Public code may contain insecure coding patterns, bugs, or references to outdated APIs or idioms. When GitHub Copilot synthesizes code suggestions based on this data, it can also synthesize code that contains these undesirable patterns. Copilot has filters in place that either block or notify users of insecure code patterns that are detected in Copilot suggestions. These filters target the most common vulnerable coding patterns, including [hardcoded credentials](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/798.html), [SQL injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/89.html), and [path injections](https://cwe.mitre.org/data/definitions/22.html). Additionally, in recent years we’ve provided tools such as GitHub Advanced Security, GitHub Actions, Dependabot, and CodeQL to open source projects to help improve code quality. Of course, you should always use GitHub Copilot together with good testing and code review practices and security tools, as well as your own judgment.

#### Is GitHub Copilot intended to fully automate code generation and replace developers?

No. Copilot is a tool intended to make developers more efficient. It’s not intended to replace developers, who should continue to apply the same sorts of safeguards and diligence they would apply with regard to any third-party code of unknown origin.

* The product is called “Copilot” not “Autopilot” and it’s not intended to generate code without oversight. You should use exactly the same sorts of safeguards and diligence with Copilot’s suggestions as you would use with any third-party code.
* Identifying best practices for use of third party code is beyond the scope of this section. That said, whatever practices your organization currently uses – rigorous functionality testing, code scanning, security testing, etc. – you should continue these policies with Copilot’s suggestions. Moreover, you should make sure your code editor or editor does not automatically compile or run generated code before you review it.

#### Can GitHub Copilot users simply use suggestions without concern?

Not necessarily. GitHub Copilot users should align their use of Copilot with their respective risk tolerances.

* As noted above, GitHub Copilot is not intended to replace developers, or their individual skill and judgment, and is not intended to fully automate the process of code development. The same risks that apply to the use of any third-party code apply to the use of Copilot’s suggestions.
* Depending on your particular use case, you should consider implementing the protections discussed above. It is your responsibility to assess what is appropriate for the situation and implement appropriate safeguards.
* You’re entitled to IP indemnification from GitHub for the unmodified suggestions when Copilot’s filtering is enabled. If you do elect to enable this feature, the copyright responsibility is ours, not our customers. As part of our ongoing commitment to responsible AI, GitHub and Microsoft extends our IP indemnity and protection support to our customers who are empowering their teams with GitHub Copilot. See [Microsoft's Copilot Copyright Commitment](https://blogs.microsoft.com/on-the-issues/2023/09/07/copilot-copyright-commitment-ai-legal-concerns/) for more details.

#### Does GitHub Copilot support accessibility features?

We are conducting internal testing of GitHub Copilot’s ease of use by developers with disabilities and working to ensure that GitHub Copilot is accessible to all developers. Please feel free to share your feedback on GitHub Copilot accessibility in our [feedback forum](https://github.com/github-community/community/discussions/categories/copilot).

#### Does GitHub Copilot produce offensive outputs?

GitHub Copilot includes filters to block offensive language in the prompts and to avoid synthesizing suggestions in sensitive contexts. We continue to work on improving the filter system to more intelligently detect and remove offensive outputs. If you see offensive outputs, please report them directly to copilot-safety@github.com so that we can improve our safeguards. GitHub takes this challenge very seriously and we are committed to addressing it.

#### Will GitHub Copilot work as well using languages other than English?

Given public sources are predominantly in English, GitHub Copilot will likely work less well in scenarios where natural language prompts provided by the developer are not in English and/or are grammatically incorrect. Therefore, non-English speakers might experience a lower quality of service.

#### What data has GitHub Copilot been trained on?

GitHub Copilot is powered by generative AI models developed by GitHub, OpenAI, and Microsoft. It has been trained on natural language text and source code from publicly available sources, including code in public repositories on GitHub.
