This document describes a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability affecting various NETGEAR router, extender, and WiFi system models. This vulnerability is identified by NETGEAR as PSV-2020-0524 and does not have an associated CVE ID.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The document states that a pre-authentication command injection vulnerability exists, but does not give details of the vulnerability itself.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
Pre-authentication command injection.

**Impact of exploitation:**
Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.

**Attack vectors:**
The attack is performed pre-authentication, which means no credentials are required. The CVSS vector indicates the attack vector is adjacent (AV:A), meaning the attacker must be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
The attacker needs to be on the same network segment as the vulnerable device and does not need to authenticate.
