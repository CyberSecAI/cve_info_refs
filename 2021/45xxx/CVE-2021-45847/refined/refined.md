The provided content relates to CVE-2021-45847. It describes multiple NULL pointer dereference vulnerabilities in the Slic3r's 3MF XML parser.

**Root cause of vulnerability:**
The root cause is the improper handling of missing attributes in 3MF XML files. The `get_attribute()` function returns NULL when an attribute is missing, and subsequent code fails to properly check for this NULL value before using it, leading to a crash.

**Weaknesses/vulnerabilities present:**
- **NULL pointer dereference:** The code attempts to dereference a NULL pointer returned by `get_attribute()` when parsing XML tags such as `<vertex>`, `<triangle>`, and `<slic3r:volume>` if required attributes are missing.
- **Ineffective error handling:** The `self->stop()` function does not terminate the current parsing function, causing execution to proceed to the point where the NULL pointer dereference occurs.

**Impact of exploitation:**
- **Denial of Service:** Exploiting these vulnerabilities results in a segmentation fault, leading to the termination of the Slic3r application and a denial of service.

**Attack vectors:**
- **Maliciously crafted 3MF file:** The attack vector is a specially crafted 3MF file containing XML elements with missing attributes that trigger the NULL pointer dereferences.
- **File Parsing:** The vulnerability is triggered during the parsing of a 3MF file using the command `slic3r --info <file.3mf>`.

**Required attacker capabilities/position:**
- The attacker must be able to create and provide a malicious 3MF file to the vulnerable Slic3r application.
- The attacker would need to have the ability to execute the `slic3r` application with the malicious file as an argument.
