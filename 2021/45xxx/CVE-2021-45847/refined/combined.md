| Summary A crafted 3MF XML document can cause a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference during parsing. Vulnerable versions  * Slic3r (commit [b1a5500](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/commit/b1a5500f427700ac3dffc0e7d9535ea65f993537))  Step to reproduce  1. Create the proof-of-concept OBJ file (`3dmodel.3dmodel`):  ``` <model>   <resources>     <object id="1">       <mesh>         <vertices>           <vertex />         </vertices>       </mesh>     </object>   </resources> </model> ```  2. Pack the file into a zip archive together with the prerequisite other files from a 3mf file:  ``` 3D/3dmodel.3dmodel rels/.rels [Content_Types].xml  ```  3. Rename the zip archive to `nullptr_3mf_vertex.3mf` 4. Execute `slic3r --info nullptr_3mf_vertex.3mf` 5. Observe segmentation fault.  Example file [nullptr\_3mf\_vertex.zip](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/files/7777535/nullptr_3mf_vertex.zip) Cause `get_attribute()` in TMF.cpp returns NULL if the sought attribute is missing. The NULL check at [TMF.cpp:580](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/blob/b1a5500f427700ac3dffc0e7d9535ea65f993537/xs/src/libslic3r/IO/TMF.cpp#L580) is ineffective, since `self->stop()` does not terminate the current function.  Execution continues to line 582, where `atof` receives a NULL pointer input, and a crash results. Impact Denial of Service. Proposed mitigation Throw an exception in `TMFParserContext::stop()` to ensure that file parsing stops immediately. |

### **[eldstal](/eldstal)** commented [Dec 26, 2021](#issue-1088841969)

| Summary A crafted 3MF XML document can cause a crash due to a NULL pointer dereference during parsing. Vulnerable versions  * Slic3r (commit [b1a5500](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/commit/b1a5500f427700ac3dffc0e7d9535ea65f993537))  Step to reproduce  1. Create the proof-of-concept OBJ file (`3dmodel.3dmodel`):  ``` <model>   <resources>     <object id="1">       <mesh>         <vertices>           <slic3r:volume />         </vertices>       </mesh>     </object>   </resources> </model> ```  2. Pack the file into a zip archive together with the prerequisite other files from a 3mf file:  ``` 3D/3dmodel.3dmodel rels/.rels [Content_Types].xml  ```  3. Rename the zip archive to `nullptr_3mf_volume.3mf` 4. Execute `slic3r --info nullptr_3mf_volume.3mf` 5. Observe segmentation fault.  Example file [nullptr\_3mf\_volume.zip](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/files/7777550/nullptr_3mf_volume.zip) Cause `get_attribute()` in TMF.cpp returns NULL if the sought attribute is missing. The constructor of `std::string` is invoked implicitly, leading to a crash (`std::string(NULL)`). The check at [TMF.cpp:602](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/blob/b1a5500f427700ac3dffc0e7d9535ea65f993537/xs/src/libslic3r/IO/TMF.cpp#L602) is ineffective, since it occurs after the NULL pointer is dereferenced. Impact Denial of Service. Proposed mitigation Perform a NULL check on the return values from `get_attribute` before constructing strings from them. Ensure that the NULL check terminates parsing, as proposed in [#5118](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/issues/5118) and [#5119](https://github.com/slic3r/Slic3r/issues/5119). |
