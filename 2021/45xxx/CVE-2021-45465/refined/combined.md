# Siemens Healthineers Security Advisory

**DICOM/BMP File Parsing Vulnerabilities in syngo fastView**

Publication Date: 2021-12-14

Last Update: 2022-02-08

Current Version: V1.1

CVSS v3.1 Base Score: 7.8

**SUMMARY**

syngo fastView contains vulnerabilities that could be triggered while parsing DICOM or BMP file. If a
user is tricked to open a malicious ﬁle in *syngo* fastView, this could lead to a crash of the application or
potential arbitrary code execution.

Siemens Healthineers recommends speciﬁc countermeasures for products where updates are not, or not
yet available.

| Affected Product and Versions | Remediation |
| --- | --- |
| *syngo fastView*: All versions | Currently no remediation is planned  See recommendations from section [Workarounds and Mitigations](#07515614) |

**WORKAROUNDS AND MITIGATIONS**

Siemens Healthineers has identiﬁed the following speciﬁc workarounds and mitigations that customers
can apply to reduce the risk:

* Download *syngo* fastView only from Siemens Healthineers ofﬁcial page
* Avoid to open untrusted ﬁles from unknown sources in *syngo* fastView
* Remove *syngo* fastView after viewing the required ﬁles

**GENERAL SECURITY RECOMMENDATIONS**
In addition, Siemens Healthineers recommends the following:

* Ensure you have appropriate backups and system restoration procedures.
* Securely delete any backup ﬁles that are no longer needed.
* For speciﬁc patch and remediation guidance information contact your local Siemens Healthineers
  Customer Service Engineer, portal or our Regional Support Center. To ﬁnd your local contact,
  please refer to [https://www.siemens-healthineers.com/how-can-we-help-you](/worldwide-contact-information/email-us)

**PRODUCT DESCRIPTION***syngo* fastView is a standalone viewer for DICOM (Digital Imaging and Communications in Medicine)
images provided on DICOM exchange media. *syngo* fastView can be used on any Windows PC but it
is not a medical device and therefore not permitted for diagnostic use. Consequently, *syngo* fastView
cannot be run on Medical Workstations from Siemens Healthineers.

**VULNERABILITY CLASSIFICATION**
The vulnerability classiﬁcation has been performed by using the CVSS scoring system in version 3.1
(CVSS v3.1)
(<https://www.ﬁrst.org/cvss/>). The CVSS environmental score is speciﬁc to the customer’s environment and will impact the overall CVSS score. The environmental score should therefore be
individually deﬁned by the customer to accomplish ﬁnal scoring.

An additional classiﬁcation has been performed using the CWE classiﬁcation, a community-developed list
of common software security weaknesses. This serves as a common language and as a baseline for
weakness identiﬁcation, mitigation, and prevention efforts. A detailed list of CWE classes can be found at:
<https://cwe.mitre.org/>.

**Vulnerability CVE-2021-40367**

The affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing DICOM ﬁles.
This could result in an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could
leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-15097)

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.8

CVSS Vector CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:U/RC:C

CWE CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

**Vulnerability CVE-2021-42028**

The affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing BMP ﬁles. This
could result in an out-of-bounds write past the end of an allocated structure. An attacker could leverage
this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-14860)

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.8

CVSS Vector CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:U/RC:C

CWE CWE-787: Out-of-bounds Write

**Vulnerability CVE-2021-45465**

The affected application lacks proper validation of user-supplied data when parsing BMP files. This could result in a write-what-where condition and an attacker could leverage this vulnerability to execute code in the context of the current process. (ZDI-CAN-15696)

CVSS v3.1 Base Score 7.8

CVSS Vector CVSS:3.1/AV:L/AC:L/PR:N/UI:R/S:U/C:H/I:H/A:H/E:P/RL:U/RC:C

CWE CWE-123: Write-what-where Condition
