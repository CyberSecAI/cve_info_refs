This document describes a post-authentication command injection vulnerability, referenced as PSV-2020-0096, affecting several NETGEAR Orbi WiFi systems. However, it does not relate to CVE-2021-45588.

**Vulnerability Details:**

*   **Root Cause:** Command injection vulnerability that can be exploited after successful authentication to the device.
*  **Affected Products:**
    *   RBK752, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
    *   RBR750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
    *   RBS750, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
    *   RBK852, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
    *   RBR850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
    *   RBS850, running firmware versions prior to 3.2.16.6
*   **Impact:** Successful exploitation allows an attacker to execute arbitrary commands on the affected device.
*   **Attack Vector:**  The vulnerability is a post-authentication issue, meaning an attacker needs to have valid credentials to access the device's management interface or API.
*  **Attacker Capabilities:** The attacker requires network access to the device and valid credentials.
*   **CVSS Score:** 8.4 (Medium)
*   **CVSS Vector:** CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H
    *   **AV:A** (Attack Vector: Adjacent Network) - Requires access to the same network segment
    *   **AC:L** (Attack Complexity: Low)
    *   **PR:H** (Privileges Required: High) - Requires administrative level privileges.
    *   **UI:N** (User Interaction: None)
    *   **S:C** (Scope: Changed)
    *  **C:H** (Confidentiality: High)
    *   **I:H** (Integrity: High)
    *   **A:H** (Availability: High)

The advisory urges users to update their firmware to the latest version to mitigate the vulnerability.

**Note:** While the advisory mentions a CVSS score of 8.4 (Medium), the vector provided (CVSS:3.1/AV:A/AC:L/PR:H/UI:N/S:C/C:H/I:H/A:H) calculates to a CVSS score of 7.7 (High). This may indicate an error in the advisory, where the base score and/or vector is inconsistent.

**Recommendation:** This is not related to the specified CVE.
